<br> 
<br> Did you ever hear of Michael Angelo?
<br> 
<br> He was a famous artist who lived in Italy in the Middle Ages. 
<br> Everybody in English Literature seemed to know about him, and the
<br> whole class laughed because I thought he was an archangel. He sounds
<br> like an archangel, doesn't he? The trouble with college is that you
<br> are expected to know such a lot of things you've never learned. 
<br> It's very embarrassing at times. But now, when the girls talk about
<br> things that I never heard of, I just keep still and look them up
<br> in the encyclopedia.
<br> 
<br> I made an awful mistake the first day. Somebody mentioned
<br> Maurice Maeterlinck, and I asked if she was a Freshman. 
<br> That joke has gone all over college. But anyway, I'm just
<br> as bright in class as any of the others--and brighter than some of them!
<br> 
<br> Do you care to know how I've furnished my room? It's a symphony
<br> in brown and yellow. The wall was tinted buff, and I've bought
<br> yellow denim curtains and cushions and a mahogany desk (second hand
<br> for three dollars) and a rattan chair and a brown rug with an ink
<br> spot in the middle. I stand the chair over the spot.
<br> 
<br> The windows are up high; you can't look out from an ordinary seat. 
<br> But I unscrewed the looking-glass from the back of the bureau,
<br> upholstered the top and moved it up against the window. It's just
<br> the right height for a window seat. You pull out the drawers like
<br> steps and walk up. Very comfortable!
<br> 
<br> Sallie McBride helped me choose the things at the Senior auction. 
<br> She has lived in a house all her life and knows about furnishing. 
<br> You can't imagine what fun it is to shop and pay with a real
<br> five-dollar bill and get some change--when you've never had more than
<br> a few cents in your life. I assure you, Daddy dear, I do appreciate
<br> that allowance.
<br> 
<br> Sallie is the most entertaining person in the world--and Julia
<br> Rutledge Pendleton the least so. It's queer what a mixture
<br> the registrar can make in the matter of room-mates. Sallie thinks
<br> everything is funny--even flunking--and Julia is bored at everything. 
<br> She never makes the slightest effort to be amiable. She believes
<br> that if you are a Pendleton, that fact alone admits you to heaven
<br> without any further examination. Julia and I were born to be enemies.
<br> 
<br> And now I suppose you've been waiting very impatiently to hear
<br> what I am learning?
<br> 
<br> I. Latin: Second Punic war. Hannibal and his forces pitched camp
<br> at Lake Trasimenus last night. They prepared an ambuscade for
<br> the Romans, and a battle took place at the fourth watch this morning. 
<br> Romans in retreat.
<br> 
<br> II. French: 24 pages of the Three Musketeers and third conjugation,
<br> irregular verbs.
<br> 
<br> III. Geometry: Finished cylinders; now doing cones.
<br> 
<br> IV. English: Studying exposition. My style improves daily
<br> in clearness and brevity.
<br> 
<br> V. Physiology: Reached the digestive system. Bile and the pancreas
<br> next time. Yours, on the way to being educated,
<br> Jerusha Abbott
<br> 
<br> 
<br> PS. I hope you never touch alcohol, Daddy? It does dreadful
<br> things to your liver.
