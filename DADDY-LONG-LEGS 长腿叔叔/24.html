<br> 
<br> Isn't it funny? I started to write to you yesterday afternoon,
<br> but as far as I got was the heading, `Dear Daddy-Long-Legs', and then
<br> I remembered I'd promised to pick some blackberries for supper,
<br> so I went off and left the sheet lying on the table, and when I
<br> came back today, what do you think I found sitting in the middle
<br> of the page? A real true Daddy-Long-Legs!
<br> 
<br> I picked him up very gently by one leg, and dropped him out
<br> of the window. I wouldn't hurt one of them for the world. 
<br> They always remind me of you.
<br> 
<br> We hitched up the spring wagon this morning and drove to the Centre
<br> to church. It's a sweet little white frame church with a spire
<br> and three Doric columns in front (or maybe Ionic--I always get
<br> them mixed).
<br> 
<br> A nice sleepy sermon with everybody drowsily waving palm-leaf fans,
<br> and the only sound, aside from the minister, the buzzing of locusts
<br> in the trees outside. I didn't wake up till I found myself on
<br> my feet singing the hymn, and then I was awfully sorry I hadn't
<br> listened to the sermon; I should like to know more of the psychology
<br> of a man who would pick out such a hymn. This was it:
<br> 
<br> Come, leave your sports and earthly toys
<br> And join me in celestial joys.
<br> Or else, dear friend, a long farewell.
<br> I leave you now to sink to hell.
<br> 
<br> 
<br> I find that it isn't safe to discuss religion with the Semples. 
<br> Their God (whom they have inherited intact from their remote
<br> Puritan ancestors) is a narrow, irrational, unjust, mean, revengeful,
<br> bigoted Person. Thank heaven I don't inherit God from anybody! 
<br> I am free to make mine up as I wish Him. He's kind and sympathetic
<br> and imaginative and forgiving and understanding--and He has a sense
<br> of humour.
<br> 
<br> I like the Semples immensely; their practice is so superior to
<br> their theory. They are better than their own God. I told them so--
<br> and they are horribly troubled. They think I am blasphemous--
<br> and I think they are! We've dropped theology from our conversation.
<br> 
<br> This is Sunday afternoon.
<br> 
<br> Amasai (hired man) in a purple tie and some bright yellow buckskin gloves,
<br> very red and shaved, has just driven off with Carrie (hired girl)
<br> in a big hat trimmed with red roses and a blue muslin dress and her
<br> hair curled as tight as it will curl. Amasai spent all the morning
<br> washing the buggy; and Carrie stayed home from church ostensibly
<br> to cook the dinner, but really to iron the muslin dress.
<br> 
<br> In two minutes more when this letter is finished I am going to settle
<br> down to a book which I found in the attic. It's entitled, On the Trail,
<br> and sprawled across the front page in a funny little-boy hand:
<br> 
<br> Jervis Pendleton
<br> if this book should ever roam,
<br> Box its ears and send it home.
<br> 
<br> 
<br> He spent the summer here once after he had been ill, when he
<br> was about eleven years old; and he left On the Trail behind. 
<br> It looks well read--the marks of his grimy little hands are frequent! 
<br> Also in a corner of the attic there is a water wheel and a windmill
<br> and some bows and arrows. Mrs. Semple talks so constantly about him
<br> that I begin to believe he really lives--not a grown man with a silk hat
<br> and walking stick, but a nice, dirty, tousle-headed boy who clatters
<br> up the stairs with an awful racket, and leaves the screen doors open,
<br> and is always asking for cookies. (And getting them, too, if I
<br> know Mrs. Semple!) He seems to have been an adventurous little soul--
<br> and brave and truthful. I'm sorry to think he is a Pendleton;
<br> he was meant for something better.
<br> 
<br> We're going to begin threshing oats tomorrow; a steam engine
<br> is coming and three extra men.
<br> 
<br> It grieves me to tell you that Buttercup (the spotted cow with
<br> one horn, Mother of Lesbia) has done a disgraceful thing. She got
<br> into the orchard Friday evening and ate apples under the trees,
<br> and ate and ate until they went to her head. For two days she
<br> has been perfectly dead drunk! That is the truth I am telling. 
<br> Did you ever hear anything so scandalous?
<br> Sir,
<br> I remain,
<br> Your affectionate orphan,
<br> Judy Abbott
<br> 
<br> 
<br> PS. Indians in the first chapter and highwaymen in the second. 
<br> I hold my breath. What can the third contain? `Red Hawk leapt
<br> twenty feet in the air and bit the dust.' That is the subject of
<br> the frontispiece. Aren't Judy and Jervie having fun?
