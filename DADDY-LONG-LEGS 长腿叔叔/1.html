<br> to be awaited with dread, endured with courage and forgotten with haste. 
<br> Every floor must be spotless, every chair dustless, and every bed
<br> without a wrinkle. Ninety-seven squirming little orphans must be
<br> scrubbed and combed and buttoned into freshly starched ginghams;
<br> and all ninety-seven reminded of their manners, and told to say,
<br> `Yes, sir,' `No, sir,' whenever a Trustee spoke.
<br> 
<br> It was a distressing time; and poor Jerusha Abbott, being the
<br> oldest orphan, had to bear the brunt of it. But this particular
<br> first Wednesday, like its predecessors, finally dragged itself
<br> to a close. Jerusha escaped from the pantry where she had been
<br> making sandwiches for the asylum's guests, and turned upstairs
<br> to accomplish her regular work. Her special care was room F,
<br> where eleven little tots, from four to seven, occupied eleven little
<br> cots set in a row. Jerusha assembled her charges, straightened their
<br> rumpled frocks, wiped their noses, and started them in an orderly
<br> and willing line towards the dining-room to engage themselves
<br> for a blessed half hour with bread and milk and prune pudding.
<br> 
<br> Then she dropped down on the window seat and leaned throbbing temples
<br> against the cool glass. She had been on her feet since five that morning,
<br> doing everybody's bidding, scolded and hurried by a nervous matron. 
<br> Mrs. Lippett, behind the scenes, did not always maintain that calm
<br> and pompous dignity with which she faced an audience of Trustees
<br> and lady visitors. Jerusha gazed out across a broad stretch of
<br> frozen lawn, beyond the tall iron paling that marked the confines
<br> of the asylum, down undulating ridges sprinkled with country estates,
<br> to the spires of the village rising from the midst of bare trees.
<br> 
<br> The day was ended--quite successfully, so far as she knew. 
<br> The Trustees and the visiting committee had made their rounds,
<br> and read their reports, and drunk their tea, and now were hurrying
<br> home to their own cheerful firesides, to forget their bothersome
<br> little charges for another month. Jerusha leaned forward
<br> watching with curiosity--and a touch of wistfulness--the stream
<br> of carriages and automobiles that rolled out of the asylum gates. 
<br> In imagination she followed first one equipage, then another,
<br> to the big houses dotted along the hillside. She pictured herself
<br> in a fur coat and a velvet hat trimmed with feathers leaning back
<br> in the seat and nonchalantly murmuring `Home' to the driver. 
<br> But on the door-sill of her home the picture grew blurred.
<br> 
<br> Jerusha had an imagination--an imagination, Mrs. Lippett told her,
<br> that would get her into trouble if she didn't take care--but keen
<br> as it was, it could not carry her beyond the front porch of the
<br> houses she would enter. Poor, eager, adventurous little Jerusha,
<br> in all her seventeen years, had never stepped inside an ordinary house;
<br> she could not picture the daily routine of those other human beings
<br> who carried on their lives undiscommoded by orphans.
<br> 
<br> Je-ru-sha Ab-bott
<br> You are wan-ted
<br> In the of-fice,
<br> And I think you'd
<br> Better hurry up!
<br> 
<br> 
<br> Tommy Dillon, who had joined the choir, came singing up the stairs
<br> and down the corridor, his chant growing louder as he approached
<br> room F. Jerusha wrenched herself from the window and refaced
<br> the troubles of life.
<br> 
<br> `Who wants me?' she cut into Tommy's chant with a note of sharp anxiety.
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Lippett in the office,
<br> And I think she's mad.
<br> Ah-a-men!
<br> 
<br> 
<br> Tommy piously intoned, but his accent was not entirely malicious. 
<br> Even the most hardened little orphan felt sympathy for an erring
<br> sister who was summoned to the office to face an annoyed matron;
<br> and Tommy liked Jerusha even if she did sometimes jerk him by the arm
<br> and nearly scrub his nose off.
<br> 
<br> Jerusha went without comment, but with two parallel lines on her brow. 
<br> What could have gone wrong, she wondered. Were the sandwiches
<br> not thin enough? Were there shells in the nut cakes? Had a lady
<br> visitor seen the hole in Susie Hawthorn's stocking? Had--O horrors!--
<br> one of the cherubic little babes in her own room F `sauced' a Trustee?
<br> 
<br> The long lower hall had not been lighted, and as she came downstairs,
<br> a last Trustee stood, on the point of departure, in the open door that
<br> led to the porte-cochere. Jerusha caught only a fleeting impression
<br> of the man--and the impression consisted entirely of tallness. 
<br> He was waving his arm towards an automobile waiting in the curved drive. 
<br> As it sprang into motion and approached, head on for an instant,
<br> the glaring headlights threw his shadow sharply against the wall inside. 
<br> The shadow pictured grotesquely elongated legs and arms that ran
<br> along the floor and up the wall of the corridor. It looked,
<br> for all the world, like a huge, wavering daddy-long-legs.
<br> 
<br> Jerusha's anxious frown gave place to quick laughter. She was by nature
<br> a sunny soul, and had always snatched the tiniest excuse to be amused. 
<br> If one could derive any sort of entertainment out of the oppressive
<br> fact of a Trustee, it was something unexpected to the good. 
<br> She advanced to the office quite cheered by the tiny episode,
<br> and presented a smiling face to Mrs. Lippett. To her surprise the
<br> matron was also, if not exactly smiling, at least appreciably affable;
<br> she wore an expression almost as pleasant as the one she donned
<br> for visitors.
<br> 
<br> `Sit down, Jerusha, I have something to say to you.' Jerusha dropped
<br> into the nearest chair and waited with a touch of breathlessness. 
<br> An automobile flashed past the window; Mrs. Lippett glanced after it.
<br> 
<br> `Did you notice the gentleman who has just gone?'
<br> 
<br> `I saw his back.'
<br> 
<br> `He is one of our most affluential Trustees, and has given large sums
<br> of money towards the asylum's support. I am not at liberty to mention
<br> his name; he expressly stipulated that he was to remain unknown.'
<br> 
<br> Jerusha's eyes widened slightly; she was not accustomed to being
<br> summoned to the office to discuss the eccentricities of Trustees
<br> with the matron.
<br> 
<br> `This gentleman has taken an interest in several of our boys. 
<br> You remember Charles Benton and Henry Freize? They were both sent
<br> through college by Mr.--er--this Trustee, and both have repaid with
<br> hard work and success the money that was so generously expended. 
<br> Other payment the gentleman does not wish. Heretofore his
<br> philanthropies have been directed solely towards the boys;
<br> I have never been able to interest him in the slightest degree
<br> in any of the girls in the institution, no matter how deserving. 
<br> He does not, I may tell you, care for girls.'
<br> 
<br> `No, ma'am,' Jerusha murmured, since some reply seemed to be expected
<br> at this point.
<br> 
<br> `To-day at the regular meeting, the question of your future was
<br> brought up.'
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Lippett allowed a moment of silence to fall, then resumed
<br> in a slow, placid manner extremely trying to her hearer's suddenly
<br> tightened nerves.
<br> 
<br> `Usually, as you know, the children are not kept after they are sixteen,
<br> but an exception was made in your case. You had finished our school
<br> at fourteen, and having done so well in your studies--not always,
<br> I must say, in your conduct--it was determined to let you go on in
<br> the village high school. Now you are finishing that, and of course
<br> the asylum cannot be responsible any longer for your support. 
<br> As it is, you have had two years more than most.'
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Lippett overlooked the fact that Jerusha had worked hard
<br> for her board during those two years, that the convenience
<br> of the asylum had come first and her education second;
<br> that on days like the present she was kept at home to scrub.
<br> 
<br> `As I say, the question of your future was brought up and your
<br> record was discussed--thoroughly discussed.'
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Lippett brought accusing eyes to bear upon the prisoner in the dock,
<br> and the prisoner looked guilty because it seemed to be expected--
<br> not because she could remember any strikingly black pages in her record.
<br> 
<br> `Of course the usual disposition of one in your place would be to
<br> put you in a position where you could begin to work, but you have
<br> done well in school in certain branches; it seems that your work
<br> in English has even been brilliant. Miss Pritchard, who is on our
<br> visiting committee, is also on the school board; she has been talking
<br> with your rhetoric teacher, and made a speech in your favour. 
<br> She also read aloud an essay that you had written entitled,
<br> "Blue Wednesday".'
<br> 
<br> Jerusha's guilty expression this time was not assumed.
<br> 
<br> `It seemed to me that you showed little gratitude in holding up
<br> to ridicule the institution that has done so much for you. Had you
<br> not managed to be funny I doubt if you would have been forgiven. 
<br> But fortunately for you, Mr.--, that is, the gentleman who has
<br> just gone--appears to have an immoderate sense of humour. 
<br> On the strength of that impertinent paper, he has offered to send
<br> you to college.'
<br> 
<br> `To college?' Jerusha's eyes grew big. Mrs. Lippett nodded.
<br> 
<br> `He waited to discuss the terms with me. They are unusual. 
<br> The gentleman, I may say, is erratic. He believes that you
<br> have originality, and he is planning to educate you to become
<br> a writer.'
<br> 
<br> `A writer?' Jerusha's mind was numbed. She could only repeat Mrs.
<br> Lippett's words.
<br> 
<br> `That is his wish. Whether anything will come of it, the future
<br> will show. He is giving you a very liberal allowance, almost, for a girl
<br> who has never had any experience in taking care of money, too liberal. 
<br> But he planned the matter in detail, and I did not feel free to
<br> make any suggestions. You are to remain here through the summer,
<br> and Miss Pritchard has kindly offered to superintend your outfit. 
<br> Your board and tuition will be paid directly to the college,
<br> and you will receive in addition during the four years you are there,
<br> an allowance of thirty-five dollars a month. This will enable you
<br> to enter on the same standing as the other students. The money will
<br> be sent to you by the gentleman's private secretary once a month,
<br> and in return, you will write a letter of acknowledgment once a month. 
<br> That is--you are not to thank him for the money; he doesn't care
<br> to have that mentioned, but you are to write a letter telling of
<br> the progress in your studies and the details of your daily life. 
<br> Just such a letter as you would write to your parents if they
<br> were living.
<br> 
<br> `These letters will be addressed to Mr. John Smith and will be sent
<br> in care of the secretary. The gentleman's name is not John Smith,
<br> but he prefers to remain unknown. To you he will never be anything
<br> but John Smith. His reason in requiring the letters is that he
<br> thinks nothing so fosters facility in literary expression as
<br> letter-writing. Since you have no family with whom to correspond,
<br> he desires you to write in this way; also, he wishes to keep
<br> track of your progress. He will never answer your letters,
<br> nor in the slightest particular take any notice of them. 
<br> He detests letter-writing and does not wish you to become a burden. 
<br> If any point should ever arise where an answer would seem
<br> to be imperative--such as in the event of your being expelled,
<br> which I trust will not occur--you may correspond with Mr. Griggs,
<br> his secretary. These monthly letters are absolutely obligatory
<br> on your part; they are the only payment that Mr. Smith requires,
<br> so you must be as punctilious in sending them as though it
<br> were a bill that you were paying. I hope that they will always
<br> be respectful in tone and will reflect credit on your training. 
<br> You must remember that you are writing to a Trustee of the John
<br> Grier Home.'
<br> 
<br> Jerusha's eyes longingly sought the door. Her head was in a whirl
<br> of excitement, and she wished only to escape from Mrs. Lippett's
<br> platitudes and think. She rose and took a tentative step backwards. 
<br> Mrs. Lippett detained her with a gesture; it was an oratorical
<br> opportunity not to be slighted.
<br> 
<br> `I trust that you are properly grateful for this very rare good fortune
<br> that has befallen you? Not many girls in your position ever have
<br> such an opportunity to rise in the world. You must always remember--'
<br> 
<br> `I--yes, ma'am, thank you. I think, if that's all, I must go
<br> and sew a patch on Freddie Perkins's trousers.'
<br> 
<br> The door closed behind her, and Mrs. Lippett watched it with dropped jaw,
<br> her peroration in mid-air.
