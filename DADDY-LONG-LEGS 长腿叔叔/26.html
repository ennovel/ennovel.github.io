<br> 
<br> Behold me--a Sophomore! I came up last Friday, sorry to leave
<br> Lock Willow, but glad to see the campus again. It is a pleasant
<br> sensation to come back to something familiar. I am beginning to feel
<br> at home in college, and in command of the situation; I am beginning,
<br> in fact, to feel at home in the world--as though I really belonged
<br> to it and had not just crept in on sufferance.
<br> 
<br> I don't suppose you understand in the least what I am trying to say. 
<br> A person important enough to be a Trustee can't appreciate the
<br> feelings of a person unimportant enough to be a foundling.
<br> 
<br> And now, Daddy, listen to this. Whom do you think I am rooming with? 
<br> Sallie McBride and Julia Rutledge Pendleton. It's the truth. 
<br> We have a study and three little bedrooms--VOILA!
<br> 
<br> Sallie and I decided last spring that we should like to room together,
<br> and Julia made up her mind to stay with Sallie--why, I can't imagine,
<br> for they are not a bit alike; but the Pendletons are naturally
<br> conservative and inimical (fine word!) to change. Anyway, here we are. 
<br> Think of Jerusha Abbott, late of the John Grier Home for Orphans,
<br> rooming with a Pendleton. This is a democratic country.
<br> 
<br> Sallie is running for class president, and unless all signs fail,
<br> she is going to be elected. Such an atmosphere of intrigue you should
<br> see what politicians we are! Oh, I tell you, Daddy, when we women get
<br> our rights, you men will have to look alive in order to keep yours. 
<br> Election comes next Saturday, and we're going to have a torchlight
<br> procession in the evening, no matter who wins.
<br> 
<br> I am beginning chemistry, a most unusual study. I've never seen
<br> anything like it before. Molecules and Atoms are the material employed,
<br> but I'll be in a position to discuss them more definitely next month.
<br> 
<br> I am also taking argumentation and logic.
<br> 
<br> Also history of the whole world.
<br> 
<br> Also plays of William Shakespeare.
<br> 
<br> Also French.
<br> 
<br> If this keeps up many years longer, I shall become quite intelligent.
<br> 
<br> I should rather have elected economics than French, but I
<br> didn't dare, because I was afraid that unless I re-elected
<br> French, the Professor would not let me pass--as it was,
<br> I just managed to squeeze through the June examination. 
<br> But I will say that my high-school preparation was not very adequate.
<br> 
<br> There's one girl in the class who chatters away in French as fast
<br> as she does in English. She went abroad with her parents when she
<br> was a child, and spent three years in a convent school. You can
<br> imagine how bright she is compared with the rest of us--irregular verbs
<br> are mere playthings. I wish my parents had chucked me into a French
<br> convent when I was little instead of a foundling asylum. Oh no,
<br> I don't either! Because then maybe I should never have known you. 
<br> I'd rather know you than French.
<br> 
<br> Goodbye, Daddy. I must call on Harriet Martin now,
<br> and, having discussed the chemical situation,
<br> casually drop a few thoughts on the subject of our next president.
<br> Yours in politics,
<br> J. Abbott
