<br> 
<br> How did your secretary come to know about Lock Willow? 
<br> (That isn't a rhetorical question. I am awfully curious to know.)
<br> For listen to this: Mr. Jervis Pendleton used to own this farm,
<br> but now he has given it to Mrs. Semple who was his old nurse. 
<br> Did you ever hear of such a funny coincidence? She still calls him
<br> `Master Jervie' and talks about what a sweet little boy he used to be. 
<br> She has one of his baby curls put away in a box, and it is red--
<br> or at least reddish!
<br> 
<br> Since she discovered that I know him, I have risen very much
<br> in her opinion. Knowing a member of the Pendleton family
<br> is the best introduction one can have at Lock Willow. 
<br> And the cream of the whole family is Master Jervis--
<br> I am pleased to say that Julia belongs to an inferior branch.
<br> 
<br> The farm gets more and more entertaining. I rode on a hay
<br> wagon yesterday. We have three big pigs and nine little piglets,
<br> and you should see them eat. They are pigs! We've oceans
<br> of little baby chickens and ducks and turkeys and guinea fowls. 
<br> You must be mad to live in a city when you might live on a farm.
<br> 
<br> It is my daily business to hunt the eggs. I fell off a beam in the
<br> barn loft yesterday, while I was trying to crawl over to a nest that
<br> the black hen has stolen. And when I came in with a scratched knee,
<br> Mrs. Semple bound it up with witch-hazel, murmuring all the time,
<br> `Dear! Dear! It seems only yesterday that Master Jervie fell off
<br> that very same beam and scratched this very same knee.'
<br> 
<br> The scenery around here is perfectly beautiful. There's a valley
<br> and a river and a lot of wooded hills, and way in the distance
<br> a tall blue mountain that simply melts in your mouth.
<br> 
<br> We churn twice a week; and we keep the cream in the spring house
<br> which is made of stone with the brook running underneath. 
<br> Some of the farmers around here have a separator, but we don't
<br> care for these new-fashioned ideas. It may be a little harder
<br> to separate the cream in pans, but it's sufficiently better to pay. 
<br> We have six calves; and I've chosen the names for all of them.
<br> 
<br> 1. Sylvia, because she was born in the woods.
<br> 
<br> 2. Lesbia, after the Lesbia in Catullus.
<br> 
<br> 3. Sallie.
<br> 
<br> 4. Julia--a spotted, nondescript animal.
<br> 
<br> 5. Judy, after me.
<br> 
<br> 6. Daddy-Long-Legs. You don't mind, do you, Daddy? He's pure
<br> Jersey and has a sweet disposition. He looks like this--you can
<br> see how appropriate the name is.
<br> 
<br> I haven't had time yet to begin my immortal novel; the farm
<br> keeps me too busy.
<br> Yours always,
<br> Judy
<br> 
<br> 
<br> PS. I've learned to make doughnuts.
<br> 
<br> PS. (2) If you are thinking of raising chickens, let me recommend
<br> Buff Orpingtons. They haven't any pin feathers.
<br> 
<br> PS. (3) I wish I could send you a pat of the nice, fresh butter
<br> I churned yesterday. I'm a fine dairy-maid!
<br> 
<br> PS. (4) This is a picture of Miss Jerusha Abbott, the future
<br> great author, driving home the cows.
