<br> 
<br> Did you ever see this campus? (That is merely a rhetorical question. 
<br> Don't let it annoy you.) It is a heavenly spot in May. All the
<br> shrubs are in blossom and the trees are the loveliest young green--
<br> even the old pines look fresh and new. The grass is dotted with yellow
<br> dandelions and hundreds of girls in blue and white and pink dresses. 
<br> Everybody is joyous and carefree, for vacation's coming, and with
<br> that to look forward to, examinations don't count.
<br> 
<br> Isn't that a happy frame of mind to be in? And oh, Daddy! 
<br> I'm the happiest of all! Because I'm not in the asylum any more;
<br> and I'm not anybody's nursemaid or typewriter or bookkeeper (I
<br> should have been, you know, except for you).
<br> 
<br> I'm sorry now for all my past badnesses.
<br> 
<br> I'm sorry I was ever impertinent to Mrs. Lippett.
<br> 
<br> I'm sorry I ever slapped Freddie Perkins.
<br> 
<br> I'm sorry I ever filled the sugar bowl with salt.
<br> 
<br> I'm sorry I ever made faces behind the Trustees' backs.
<br> 
<br> I'm going to be good and sweet and kind to everybody because I'm
<br> so happy. And this summer I'm going to write and write and write
<br> and begin to be a great author. Isn't that an exalted stand
<br> to take? Oh, I'm developing a beautiful character! It droops
<br> a bit under cold and frost, but it does grow fast when the sun shines.
<br> 
<br> That's the way with everybody. I don't agree with the theory that
<br> adversity and sorrow and disappointment develop moral strength. 
<br> The happy people are the ones who are bubbling over with kindliness. 
<br> I have no faith in misanthropes. (Fine word! Just learned it.)
<br> You are not a misanthrope are you, Daddy?
<br> 
<br> I started to tell you about the campus. I wish you'd come
<br> for a little visit and let me walk you about and say:
<br> 
<br> `That is the library. This is the gas plant, Daddy dear. 
<br> The Gothic building on your left is the gymnasium, and the Tudor
<br> Romanesque beside it is the new infirmary.'
<br> 
<br> Oh, I'm fine at showing people about. I've done it all my life at
<br> the asylum, and I've been doing it all day here. I have honestly.
<br> 
<br> And a Man, too!
<br> 
<br> That's a great experience. I never talked to a man before (except
<br> occasional Trustees, and they don't count). Pardon, Daddy, I don't
<br> mean to hurt your feelings when I abuse Trustees. I don't consider
<br> that you really belong among them. You just tumbled on to the Board
<br> by chance. The Trustee, as such, is fat and pompous and benevolent. 
<br> He pats one on the head and wears a gold watch chain.
<br> 
<br> That looks like a June bug, but is meant to be a portrait of any
<br> Trustee except you.
<br> 
<br> However--to resume:
<br> 
<br> I have been walking and talking and having tea with a man. 
<br> And with a very superior man--with Mr. Jervis Pendleton of the House
<br> of Julia; her uncle, in short (in long, perhaps I ought to say;
<br> he's as tall as you.) Being in town on business, he decided to run
<br> out to the college and call on his niece. He's her father's
<br> youngest brother, but she doesn't know him very intimately. It seems
<br> he glanced at her when she was a baby, decided he didn't like her,
<br> and has never noticed her since.
<br> 
<br> Anyway, there he was, sitting in the reception room very proper
<br> with his hat and stick and gloves beside him; and Julia and Sallie
<br> with seventh-hour recitations that they couldn't cut. So Julia
<br> dashed into my room and begged me to walk him about the campus
<br> and then deliver him to her when the seventh hour was over. 
<br> I said I would, obligingly but unenthusiastically, because I don't
<br> care much for Pendletons.
<br> 
<br> But he turned out to be a sweet lamb. He's a real human being--
<br> not a Pendleton at all. We had a beautiful time; I've longed
<br> for an uncle ever since. Do you mind pretending you're my uncle? 
<br> I believe they're superior to grandmothers.
<br> 
<br> Mr. Pendleton reminded me a little of you, Daddy, as you were twenty
<br> years ago. You see I know you intimately, even if we haven't
<br> ever met!
<br> 
<br> He's tall and thinnish with a dark face all over lines, and the
<br> funniest underneath smile that never quite comes through but just
<br> wrinkles up the corners of his mouth. And he has a way of making
<br> you feel right off as though you'd known him a long time. 
<br> He's very companionable.
<br> 
<br> We walked all over the campus from the quadrangle to the athletic grounds;
<br> then he said he felt weak and must have some tea. He proposed that
<br> we go to College Inn--it's just off the campus by the pine walk. 
<br> I said we ought to go back for Julia and Sallie, but he said he didn't
<br> like to have his nieces drink too much tea; it made them nervous. 
<br> So we just ran away and had tea and muffins and marmalade and
<br> ice-cream and cake at a nice little table out on the balcony. 
<br> The inn was quite conveniently empty, this being the end of the month
<br> and allowances low.
<br> 
<br> We had the jolliest time! But he had to run for his train
<br> the minute he got back and he barely saw Julia at all. She was
<br> furious with me for taking him off; it seems he's an unusually rich
<br> and desirable uncle. It relieved my mind to find he was rich,
<br> for the tea and things cost sixty cents apiece.
<br> 
<br> This morning (it's Monday now) three boxes of chocolates came by
<br> express for Julia and Sallie and me. What do you think of that? 
<br> To be getting candy from a man!
<br> 
<br> I begin to feel like a girl instead of a foundling.
<br> 
<br> I wish you'd come and have tea some day and let me see if I like you. 
<br> But wouldn't it be dreadful if I didn't? However, I know I should.
<br> 
<br> Bien! I make you my compliments.
<br> `Jamais je ne t'oublierai.'
<br> Judy
<br> 
<br> 
<br> PS. I looked in the glass this morning and found a perfectly
<br> new dimple that I'd never seen before. It's very curious. 
<br> Where do you suppose it came from?
