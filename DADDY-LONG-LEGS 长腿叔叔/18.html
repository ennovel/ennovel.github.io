<br> 
<br> I hope you aren't the Trustee who sat on the toad? It went off--
<br> I was told--with quite a pop, so probably he was a fatter Trustee.
<br> 
<br> Do you remember the little dugout places with gratings over them
<br> by the laundry windows in the John Grier Home? Every spring when the
<br> hoptoad season opened we used to form a collection of toads and keep
<br> them in those window holes; and occasionally they would spill over
<br> into the laundry, causing a very pleasurable commotion on wash days. 
<br> We were severely punished for our activities in this direction,
<br> but in spite of all discouragement the toads would collect.
<br> 
<br> And one day--well, I won't bore you with particulars--but somehow,
<br> one of the fattest, biggest, JUCIEST toads got into one of those
<br> big leather arm chairs in the Trustees' room, and that afternoon
<br> at the Trustees' meeting--But I dare say you were there and recall
<br> the rest?
<br> 
<br> Looking back dispassionately after a period of time, I will say
<br> that punishment was merited, and--if I remember rightly--adequate.
<br> 
<br> I don't know why I am in such a reminiscent mood except that
<br> spring and the reappearance of toads always awakens the old
<br> acquisitive instinct. The only thing that keeps me from starting
<br> a collection is the fact that no rule exists against it.
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> After chapel, Thursday
<br> 
<br> What do you think is my favourite book? Just now, I mean; I change
<br> every three days. Wuthering Heights. Emily Bronte was quite young
<br> when she wrote it, and had never been outside of Haworth churchyard. 
<br> She had never known any men in her life; how COULD she imagine a man
<br> like Heathcliffe?
<br> 
<br> I couldn't do it, and I'm quite young and never outside the John
<br> Grier Asylum--I've had every chance in the world. Sometimes a
<br> dreadful fear comes over me that I'm not a genius. Will you be
<br> awfully disappointed, Daddy, if I don't turn out to be a great author? 
<br> In the spring when everything is so beautiful and green and budding,
<br> I feel like turning my back on lessons, and running away to play with
<br> the weather. There are such lots of adventures out in the fields! 
<br> It's much more entertaining to live books than to write them.
<br> 
<br> Ow ! ! ! ! ! !
<br> 
<br> That was a shriek which brought Sallie and Julia and (for a
<br> disgusted moment) the Senior from across the hall. It was caused
<br> by a centipede like this: only worse. Just as I had finished the
<br> last sentence and was thinking what to say next--plump!--it fell off
<br> the ceiling and landed at my side. I tipped two cups off the tea
<br> table in trying to get away. Sallie whacked it with the back of my
<br> hair brush--which I shall never be able to use again--and killed
<br> the front end, but the rear fifty feet ran under the bureau and escaped.
<br> 
<br> This dormitory, owing to its age and ivy-covered walls, is full
<br> of centipedes. They are dreadful creatures. I'd rather find
<br> a tiger under the bed.
<br> 
<br> 
<br> Friday, 9.30 p.m.
<br> 
<br> Such a lot of troubles! I didn't hear the rising bell this morning,
<br> then I broke my shoestring while I was hurrying to dress and
<br> dropped my collar button down my neck. I was late for breakfast
<br> and also for first-hour recitation. I forgot to take any blotting
<br> paper and my fountain pen leaked. In trigonometry the Professor
<br> and I had a disagreement touching a little matter of logarithms. 
<br> On looking it up, I find that she was right. We had mutton stew
<br> and pie-plant for lunch--hate 'em both; they taste like the asylum. 
<br> The post brought me nothing but bills (though I must say that I
<br> never do get anything else; my family are not the kind that write).
<br> In English class this afternoon we had an unexpected written lesson. 
<br> This was it:
<br> 
<br> I asked no other thing,
<br> No other was denied.
<br> I offered Being for it;
<br> The mighty merchant smiled.
<br> 
<br> Brazil? He twirled a button
<br> Without a glance my way:
<br> But, madam, is there nothing else
<br> That we can show today?
<br> 
<br> 
<br> That is a poem. I don't know who wrote it or what it means. It
<br> was simply printed out on the blackboard when we arrived and we
<br> were ordered to comment upon it. When I read the first verse
<br> I thought I had an idea--The Mighty Merchant was a divinity
<br> who distributes blessings in return for virtuous deeds--
<br> but when I got to the second verse and found him twirling a button,
<br> it seemed a blasphemous supposition, and I hastily changed my mind. 
<br> The rest of the class was in the same predicament; and there we
<br> sat for three-quarters of an hour with blank paper and equally
<br> blank minds. Getting an education is an awfully wearing process!
<br> 
<br> But this didn't end the day. There's worse to come.
<br> 
<br> It rained so we couldn't play golf, but had to go to gymnasium instead. 
<br> The girl next to me banged my elbow with an Indian club. I got
<br> home to find that the box with my new blue spring dress had come,
<br> and the skirt was so tight that I couldn't sit down. Friday is
<br> sweeping day, and the maid had mixed all the papers on my desk. 
<br> We had tombstone for dessert (milk and gelatin flavoured with vanilla).
<br> We were kept in chapel twenty minutes later than usual to listen to
<br> a speech about womanly women. And then--just as I was settling down
<br> with a sigh of well-earned relief to The Portrait of a Lady, a girl
<br> named Ackerly, a dough-faced, deadly, unintermittently stupid girl,
<br> who sits next to me in Latin because her name begins with A (I
<br> wish Mrs. Lippett had named me Zabriski), came to ask if Monday's
<br> lesson commenced at paragraph 69 or 70, and stayed ONE HOUR. 
<br> She has just gone.
<br> 
<br> Did you ever hear of such a discouraging series of events? 
<br> It isn't the big troubles in life that require character. 
<br> Anybody can rise to a crisis and face a crushing tragedy with courage,
<br> but to meet the petty hazards of the day with a laugh--I really
<br> think that requires SPIRIT.
<br> 
<br> It's the kind of character that I am going to develop. I am
<br> going to pretend that all life is just a game which I must play
<br> as skilfully and fairly as I can. If I lose, I am going to shrug
<br> my shoulders and laugh--also if I win.
<br> 
<br> Anyway, I am going to be a sport. You will never hear me
<br> complain again, Daddy dear, because Julia wears silk stockings
<br> and centipedes drop off the wall.
<br> Yours ever,
<br> Judy
<br> 
<br> Answer soon.
