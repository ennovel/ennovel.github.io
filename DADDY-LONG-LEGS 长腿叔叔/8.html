<br> 
<br> Listen to what I've learned to-day.
<br> 
<br> The area of the convex surface of the frustum of a regular pyramid
<br> is half the product of the sum of the perimeters of its bases
<br> by the altitude of either of its trapezoids.
<br> 
<br> It doesn't sound true, but it is--I can prove it!
<br> 
<br> You've never heard about my clothes, have you, Daddy? Six dresses,
<br> all new and beautiful and bought for me--not handed down from
<br> somebody bigger. Perhaps you don't realize what a climax that marks
<br> in the career of an orphan? You gave them to me, and I am very, very,
<br> VERY much obliged. It's a fine thing to be educated--but nothing
<br> compared to the dizzying experience of owning six new dresses. 
<br> Miss Pritchard, who is on the visiting committee, picked them out--
<br> not Mrs. Lippett, thank goodness. I have an evening dress, pink mull
<br> over silk (I'm perfectly beautiful in that), and a blue church dress,
<br> and a dinner dress of red veiling with Oriental trimming (makes
<br> me look like a Gipsy), and another of rose-coloured challis,
<br> and a grey street suit, and an every-day dress for classes. 
<br> That wouldn't be an awfully big wardrobe for Julia Rutledge Pendleton,
<br> perhaps, but for Jerusha Abbott--Oh, my!
<br> 
<br> I suppose you're thinking now what a frivolous, shallow little
<br> beast she is, and what a waste of money to educate a girl?
<br> 
<br> But, Daddy, if you'd been dressed in checked ginghams all your life,
<br> you'd appreciate how I feel. And when I started to the high school,
<br> I entered upon another period even worse than the checked ginghams.
<br> 
<br> The poor box.
<br> 
<br> You can't know how I dreaded appearing in school in those miserable
<br> poor-box dresses. I was perfectly sure to be put down in class
<br> next to the girl who first owned my dress, and she would whisper
<br> and giggle and point it out to the others. The bitterness
<br> of wearing your enemies' cast-off clothes eats into your soul. 
<br> If I wore silk stockings for the rest of my life, I don't believe
<br> I could obliterate the scar.
<br> 
<br> LATEST WAR BULLETIN!
<br> 
<br> News from the Scene of Action.
<br> 
<br> 
<br> At the fourth watch on Thursday the 13th of November, Hannibal routed
<br> the advance guard of the Romans and led the Carthaginian forces
<br> over the mountains into the plains of Casilinum. A cohort of light
<br> armed Numidians engaged the infantry of Quintus Fabius Maximus. 
<br> Two battles and light skirmishing. Romans repulsed with heavy losses.
<br> I have the honour of being,
<br> Your special correspondent from the front,
<br> J. Abbott
<br> 
<br> PS. I know I'm not to expect any letters in return, and I've
<br> been warned not to bother you with questions, but tell me, Daddy,
<br> just this once--are you awfully old or just a little old? And are
<br> you perfectly bald or just a little bald? It is very difficult
<br> thinking about you in the abstract like a theorem in geometry.
<br> 
<br> Given a tall rich man who hates girls, but is very generous to one
<br> quite impertinent girl, what does he look like?
<br> 
<br> R.S.V.P.
