<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now it came about after this that death came to Nahash, the king of the children of Ammon, and his son became king in his place.
<br>19:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;大 卫 说 ， 我 要 照 哈 嫩 的 父 亲 拿 辖 厚 待 我 的 恩 典 厚 待 哈 嫩 。 于 是 大 卫 差 遣 使 者 为 他 丧 父 安 慰 他 。 大 卫 的 臣 仆 到 了 亚 扪 人 的 境 内 见 哈 嫩 ， 要 安 慰 他 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And David said, I will be a friend to Hanun, the son of Nahash, because his father was a friend to me. So David sent men to him, to give him words of comfort on account of his father. And the servants of David came to Hanun, to the land of the children of Ammon, offering him comfort.
<br>19:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 亚 扪 人 的 首 领 对 哈 嫩 说 ， 大 卫 差 人 来 安 慰 你 ， 你 想 他 是 尊 敬 你 父 亲 吗 ？ 他 的 臣 仆 来 见 你 不 是 为 详 察 窥 探 ， 倾 覆 这 地 吗 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But the chiefs of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Does it seem to you that David is honouring your father, by sending comforters to you? is it not clear that these men have only come to go through the land and to make secret observation of it so that they may overcome it?
<br>19:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;哈 嫩 便 将 大 卫 臣 仆 的 胡 须 剃 去 一 半 ， 又 割 断 他 们 下 半 截 的 衣 服 ， 使 他 们 露 出 下 体 ， 打 发 他 们 回 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So Hanun took David's servants, and cutting off their hair and the skirts of their robes up to the middle, sent them away.
<br>19:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 人 将 臣 仆 所 遇 的 事 告 诉 大 卫 ， 他 就 差 人 去 迎 接 他 们 ， 因 为 他 们 甚 觉 羞 耻 。 告 诉 他 们 说 ， 可 以 住 在 耶 利 哥 ， 等 到 胡 须 长 起 再 回 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then there went certain, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and then return.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then certain men went and gave David word of what had been done to them. And he sent out with the purpose of meeting them; for the men were greatly shamed. And the king said, Keep where you are at Jericho till your hair is long again, and then come back.
<br>19:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;亚 扪 人 知 道 大 卫 憎 恶 他 们 ， 哈 嫩 和 亚 扪 人 就 打 发 人 拿 一 千 他 连 得 银 子 ， 从 米 所 波 大 米 ， 亚 兰 ， 玛 迦 ， 琐 巴 雇 战 车 和 马 兵 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out of Zobah.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves hated by David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver as payment for war-carriages and horsemen from Mesopotamia and Aram-maacah and Zobah.
<br>19:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 雇 了 三 万 二 千 辆 战 车 和 玛 迦 王 并 他 的 军 兵 。 他 们 来 安 营 在 米 底 巴 前 。 亚 扪 人 也 从 他 们 的 城 里 出 来 ， 聚 集 交 战 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So with this money they got thirty-two thousand war-carriages, and the help of the king of Maacah and his people, who came and took up their position in front of Medeba. And the children of Ammon came together from their towns for the fight.
<br>19:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;大 卫 听 见 了 ， 就 差 派 约 押 统 带 勇 猛 的 全 军 出 去 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And David, hearing of it, sent Joab with all the army of fighting-men.
<br>19:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;亚 扪 人 出 来 在 城 门 前 摆 阵 ， 所 来 的 诸 王 另 在 郊 野 摆 阵 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So the children of Ammon came out and put their forces in position on the way into the town; and the kings who had come were stationed by themselves in the field.
<br>19:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;约 押 看 见 敌 人 在 他 前 后 摆 阵 ， 就 从 以 色 列 军 中 挑 选 精 兵 ， 使 他 们 对 着 亚 兰 人 摆 阵 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put them in array against the Syrians.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now when Joab saw that their forces were in position against him in front and at his back, he took all the best men of Israel, and put them in line against the Aramaeans;
<br>19:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;其 余 的 兵 交 与 他 兄 弟 亚 比 筛 ， 对 着 亚 扪 人 摆 阵 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against the children of Ammon.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the rest of the people he put in position against the children of Ammon with Abishai, his brother, at their head.
<br>19:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;约 押 对 亚 比 筛 说 ， 亚 兰 人 若 强 过 我 ， 你 就 来 帮 助 我 。 亚 扪 人 若 强 过 你 ， 我 就 去 帮 助 你 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he said, If the Aramaeans are stronger and get the better of me, then come to my help; and if the children of Ammon get the better of you, I will come to your help.
<br>19:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 们 都 当 刚 强 ， 为 本 国 的 民 和 神 的 城 邑 作 大 丈 夫 ， 愿 耶 和 华 凭 他 的 意 旨 而 行 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do that which is good in his sight.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Take heart, and let us be strong for our people and for the towns of our God; and may the Lord do what seems good to him.
<br>19:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 约 押 和 跟 随 他 的 人 前 进 攻 打 亚 兰 人 。 亚 兰 人 在 约 押 面 前 逃 跑 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So Joab and the people who were with him went forward into the fight against the Aramaeans, and they went in flight before him.
<br>19:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;亚 扪 人 见 亚 兰 人 逃 跑 ， 他 们 也 在 约 押 的 兄 弟 亚 比 筛 面 前 逃 跑 进 城 。 约 押 就 回 耶 路 撒 冷 去 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the children of Ammon saw the flight of the Aramaeans, they themselves went in flight from Abishai, his brother, and came into the town. Then Joab came back to Jerusalem.
<br>19:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;亚 兰 人 见 自 己 被 以 色 列 人 打 败 ， 就 打 发 使 者 将 大 河 那 边 的 亚 兰 人 调 来 ， 哈 大 利 谢 的 将 军 朔 法 率 领 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the Aramaeans saw that Israel had overcome them, they sent men to get the Aramaeans who were on the other side of the River, with Shophach, the captain of Hadadezer's army, at their head.
<br>19:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;有 人 告 诉 大 卫 ， 他 就 聚 集 以 色 列 众 人 过 约 旦 河 ， 来 到 亚 兰 人 那 里 ， 迎 着 他 们 摆 阵 。 大 卫 既 摆 阵 攻 击 亚 兰 人 ， 亚 兰 人 就 与 他 打 仗 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And word of this was given to David; and he got all Israel together and went over Jordan and came to Helam and put his forces in position against them. And when David's forces were in position against the Aramaeans, the fight was started.
<br>19:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;亚 兰 人 在 以 色 列 人 面 前 逃 跑 。 大 卫 杀 了 亚 兰 七 千 辆 战 车 的 人 ， 四 万 步 兵 ， 又 杀 了 亚 兰 的 将 军 朔 法 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the Aramaeans went in flight before Israel; and David put to the sword the men of seven thousand Aramaean war-carriages and forty thousand footmen, and put to death Shophach, the captain of the army.
<br>19:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;属 哈 大 利 谢 的 诸 王 见 自 己 被 以 色 列 人 打 败 ， 就 与 大 卫 和 好 ， 归 服 他 。 于 是 亚 兰 人 不 敢 再 帮 助 亚 扪 人 了 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were overcome by Israel, they made peace with David and became his servants: and the Aramaeans would give no more help to the children of Ammon.
