One big doorwas open, and seats, arranged lengthwise, faced thered table-cloths which formed the curtain. A row oflamps made very good foot-lights, and an invisibleband performed a Wagner-like overture on combs,tin trumpets, drums, and pipes, with an accompanimentof suppressed laughter.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Many of the children had never seen any thing likeit, and sat staring about them in mute admiration andexpectancy; but the older ones criticised freely, andindulged in wild speculations as to the meaning ofvarious convulsions of nature going on behind thecurtain.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　While Teacher was dressing the actresses for thetragedy, Miss Celia and Thorny, who were old handsat this sort of amusement, gave a "Potato" pantomimeas a side show.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Across an empty stall a green cloth was fastened,so high that the heads of the operators were not seen.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　A little curtain flew up, disclosing the front of aChinese pagoda painted on pasteboard, with a doorand window which opened quite naturally. This stoodon one side, several green trees with paper lanternshanging from the boughs were on the other side, andthe words "Tea Garden," printed over the top, showedthe nature of this charming spot.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Few of the children had ever seen the immortalPunch and Judy, so this was a most agreeable novelty,and before they could make out what it meant, avoice began to sing, so distinctly that every word washeard, --"In China there lived a little man,His name was Chingery Wangery Chan."Here the hero "took the stage" with great dignity,clad in a loose yellow jacket over a blue skirt, whichconcealed the hand that made his body. A pointedhat adorned his head, and on removing this to bowhe disclosed a bald pate with a black queue in themiddle, and a Chinese face nicely painted on thepotato, the lower part of which was hollowed out tofit Thorny's first finger, while his thumb and secondfinger were in the sleeves of the yellow jacket, makinga lively pair of arms. While he saluted, the songwent n, --"His legs were short, his feet were small,And this little man could not walk at all."Which assertion was proved to be false by the agilitywith which the "little man " danced a jig in timeto the rollicking chorus, --"Chingery changery ri co day,Ekel tekel happy man;Uron odesko canty oh, oh,Gallopy wallopy China go."At the close of the dance and chorus, Chan retiredinto the tea garden, and drank so many cups of thenational beverage, with such comic gestures, that thespectators were almost sorry when the opening ofthe opposite window drew all eyes in that direction.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　At the lattice appeared a lovely being; for this potatohad been pared, and on the white surface were paintedpretty pink checks, red lips, black eyes, and obliquebrows; through the tuft of dark silk on the headwere stuck several glittering pins, and a pink jacketshrouded the plump figure of this capital little Chineselady. After peeping coyly out, so that all couldsee and admire, she fell to counting the money froma purse, so large her small hands could hardly hold iton the window seat. While she did this, the songwent on to explain, --"Miss Ki Hi was short and squat,She had money and he had notSo off to her he resolved to go,And play her a tune on his little banjo."During the chorus to this verse Chan was seen tuninghis instrument in the garden, and at the endsallied gallantly forth to sing the following tenderstrain, --"Whang fun li,Tang hua ki,Hong Kong do ra me!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ah sin lo,Pan to fo,Tsing up chin leute!"Carried away by his passion, Chan dropped hisbanjo, fell upon his knees, and, clasping his hands,bowed his forehead in the dust before his idol. But,alas! --"Miss Ki Hi heard his notes of love,And held her wash-bowl up aboveIt fell upon the little man,And this was the end of Chingery Chan,"Indeed it was; for, as the doll's basin of real waterwas cast forth by the cruel charmer, poor Chan expiredin such strong convulsions that his head rolleddown among the audience. Miss Ki Hi peeped tosee what had become of her victim, and the shutterdecapitated her likewise, to the great delight of thechildren, who passed around the heads, pronouncinga "Potato" pantomime "first-rate fun."Then they settled themselves for the show, havingbeen assured by Manager Thorny that they were aboutto behold the most elegant and varied combinationever produced on any stage. And when one readsthe following very inadequate description of thesomewhat mixed entertainment, it is impossible to denythat the promise made was nobly kept.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　After some delay and several crashes behind thecurtain, which mightily amused the audience, theperformance began with the well-known tragedy of"Bluebeard;" for Bab had set her heart upon it,and the young folks had acted it so often in theirplays that it was very easy to get up, with a fewextra touches to scenery and costumes. Thorny wassuperb as the tyrant with a beard of bright blue worsted,a slouched hat and long feather, fur cloak, redhose, rubber boots, and a real sword which clankedtragically as he walked. He spoke in such a deepvoice, knit his corked eye-brows, and glared sofrightfully, that it was no wonder poor Fatima quakedbefore him as he gave into her keeping an immensebunch of keys with one particularly big, bright one,among them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Bab was fine to see, with Miss Celia's blue dresssweeping behind her, a white plume in her flowinghair, and a real necklace with a pearl locket about herneck. She did her part capitally, especially the shriekshe gave when she looked into the fatal closet, theenergy with which she scrubbed the tell-tale key,and her distracted tone when she callcd out: "SisterAnne, O, sister Anne, do you see anybody coming?"while her enraged husband was roaring: "Will youcome down, madam, or shall I come and fetchyou?"Betty made a captivating Anne, -- all in white muslin,and a hat full of such lovely pink roses that shecould not help putting up one hand to feel them asshe stood on the steps looking out at the little windowfor the approaching brothers who made such a dinthat it sounded like a dozen horsemen instead if two.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ben and Billy were got up regardless of expense inthe way of arms; for their belts were perfect arsenals,and their wooden swoids were big enough to striketerror into any soul, though they struck no sparks outof Bluebeard's blade in the awful combat which precededthe villain's downfall and death.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The boys enjoyed this part intensely, and cries of"Go it, Ben!" " Hit him again, Billy!" "Two againstone isn't fair!" "Thorny's a match for 'em." " Nowhe's down, hurray!" cheered on the combatants, till,after a terrific struggle, the tyrant fell, and withconvulsive twitchings of the scarlet legs, slowly expiredwhile the ladies sociably fainted in each other's arms,and the brothers waved their swords and shook handsover the corpse of their enemy.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　This piece was rapturously applauded, and all theperformers had to appear and bow their thanks, ledby the defunct Bluebeard, who mildly warned theexcited audience that if they "didn't look out the seatswould break down, and then there'd be a nice mess."Calmed by this fear they composed themselves, andwaited with ardor for the next play, which promised tobe a lively one, judging from the shrieks of laughterwhich came from behind the cuitain.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Sanch 's going to be in it, I know; for I heardBen say, 'Hold him still; he won't bite,'" whisperedSam, longing to "jounce up and down, so great washis satisfaction at the prospect, for the dog wasconsidered the star of the company.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I hope Bab will do something else, she is so funny.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Wasn't her dress elegant?" said Sally Folsum, burningto wear a long wilk gown and a feathei in her hair.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I like Betty best, she's so cunning, and she peekedout of the window just as if she really saw somebodycoming," answered Liddy Peckham, privately resolvingto tease mother for some pink roses before anotherSunday came.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Up went the curtain at last, and a voice announced"A Tragedy in Three Tableaux." "There's Betty!"was the general exclamation, as the audience recognizeda familiar face under the little red hood worn bythe child who stood receiving a basket from Teacher,who made a nice mother with her finger up, as iftelling the small messenger not to loiter by the way.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I know what that is!" cried Sally; "it's 'Mabelon Midsummer Day.' The piece Miss Celia spoke;don't you know?""There isn't any sick baby, and Mabel had a 'kerchiefpinned about her head.' I say it's Red RidingHood," answered Liddy, who had begun to learnMary Howitt's pretty poem for her next piece, andknew all about it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The question was settled by the appearance of thewolf in the second scene, and such a wolf! On fewamateur stages do we find so natural an actor for thatpart, or so good a costume, for Sanch was irresistiblydroll in the gray wolf-skin which usually lay besideMiss Celia's bed, now fitted over his back and fastenedneatly down underneath, with his own facepeeping out at one end, and the handsome tail bobinggayly at the other. What a comfort that tail wasto Sancho, none but a bereaved bow-wow could evertell. It reconciled him to his distasteful part at once,it made rehearsals a joy, and even before the publiche could not resist turning to catch a glimpse of thenoble appendage, while his own brief member waggedwith the proud consciousness that though the tail didnot match the head, it was long enough to be seen ofall men and dogs.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　That was a pretty picture, for the little maid camewalking in with the basket on her arm, and such aninnocent face inside the bright hood that it was quitenatural the gray wolf should trot up to her withdeceitful friendliness, that she should pat and talkto him confidingly about the butter for grandma, andthen that they should walk away together, he politelycarrying her basket, she with her hand on his head,little dreaming what evil plans were taking shapeinside.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The children encored that, but there was no timeto repeat it, so they listened to more stifled merrimentbehind the red table-cloths, and wonderedwhether the next scene would be the wolf popping hishead out ofthe window as Red Riding Hood knocks,or the tragic end of that sweet child.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　It was neither, for a nice bed had been made, andin it reposed the false grandmother, with a rufflednightcap on, a white gown, and spectacles. Bettylay beside the wolf, staring at him as if just about tosay, "Why, grandma, what great teeth you've got!"for Sancho's mouth was half open and a red tonguehung out, as he panted with the exertion of keepingstill. This tableau was so very good, and yet sofunny, that the children clapped and shouted frantically;this excited the dog, who gave a bounce andwould have leaped off the bed to bark at the rioters,if Betty had not caught him by the legs, and Thornydropped the curtain just at the moment when thewicked wolf was apparently in the act of devouringthe poor little girl, with most effuctive growls.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　They had to come out then, and did so, both muchdishevelled by the late tussle, for Sancho's cap was allover one eye, and Betty's hood was anywhere but onher head. She made her courtesy prettily, however;her fellow-actor bowed with as much dignity as a shortnight-gown permitted, and they retired to their well-earned repose.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Then Thorny, looking much excited, appeared tomake the following request: "As one of the actors inthe next piece is new to the business, the companymust all keep as still as mice, and not stir till I givethe word. It's perfectly splendid! so don't you spoilit by making a row.""What do you suppose it is?" asked every one, andlistened with all their might to get a hint, if possible.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　But what they heard only whetted their curiosity andmystified them more and more. Bab's voice cried ina loud whisper, "Isn't Ben beautiful?" Then therewas a thumping noise, and Miss Celia said, in ananxious tone, "Oh, do be careful," while Ben laughedout as if he was too happy to care who heard him,and Thorny bawled "Whoa!" in a way which wouldhave attracted attention if Lita's head had notpopped out of her box, more than once, to surveythe invaders of her abode, with a much astonishedexpression.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Sounds kind of circusy, don't it?" said Sam toBilly, who had come out to receive the complimentsof the company and enjoy the tableau at a safedistance.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You just wait till you see what's coming. It beatsany circus I ever saw," answered Billy, rubbing hishands with the air of a man who had seen many insteadof but one.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Ready! Be quick and get out of the way whenshe goes off!" whispered Ben, but they heard him andprepared for pistols, rockets or combustibles of somesort, as ships were impossible under the circumstances,and no other "She" occurred to them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　A unanimous "O-o-o-o !" was heard when the curtainrose, but a stern "Hush!" from Thorny keptthem mutely staring with all their eyes at the grandspectacle of the evening. There stood Lita with awide flat saddle on her back, a white head-stall andreins, blue rosettes in her ears, and the look of amuch-bewildered beast in her bright eyes. But who thegauzy, spangled, winged creature was, with a giltcrown on its head, a little bow in its hand, and one whiteslipper in the air, while the other seemed merely totouch the saddle, no one could tell for a minute, sostrange and splendid did the apparition appear. Nowonder Ben was not recognized in this brilliantdisguise, which was more natural to him than Billy's blueflannel or Thorny's respectable garments. He had sobegged to be allowed to show himself "just once," ashe used to be in the days when "father" tossed himup on the bare-backed old General, for hundreds tosee and admire, that Miss Celia had consented, muchagainst her will, and hastily arranged some bits ofspangled tarlatan over the white cotton suit which was tosimulate the regulation tights. Her old dancing slippersfitted, and gold paper did the rest, while Ben,sure of his power over Lita, promised not to breakhis bones, and lived for days on the thought of themoment when he could show the boys that he had notboasted vainly of past splendors.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Before the delighted children could get their breath,Lita gave signs of her dislike to the foot-lights, and,gathering up the reins that lay on her neck, Ben gavethe old cry, "Houp-la!" and let her go, as he hadoften done before, straight out of the coach-house fora gallop round the orchard.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Just turn about and you can see perfectly well,but stay where you are till he comes back," commandedThorny, as signs of commotion appeared inthe excited audience.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Round went the twenty children as if turned byone crank, and sitting there they looked out into themoonlight where the shining figure flashed to and fro,now so near they could see the smiling face underthe crown, now so far away that it glittered like afire-fly among the dusky green. Lita enjoyed thatrace as heartily as she had done several others of late,and caracoled about as if anxious to make up for herlack of skill by speed and obedience. How muchBen liked it there is no need to tell, yet it was aproof of the good which three months of a quiet, usefullife had done him, that even as he pranced gaylyunder the boughs thick with the red and yellow applesalmost ready to be gathered, he found this riding inthe fresh air with only his mates for an audiencepleasanter than the crowded tent, the tired horses,profane men, and painted women, friendly as some ofthem had been to him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　After the first burst was over, he felt rather glad, onthe whole, that he was going back to plain clothes,helpful school, and kindly people, who cared more tohave him a good boy than the most famous Cupid thatever stood on one leg with a fast horse under him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You may make as much noise as you like, now;Lita's had her run and will be as quiet as a lamb afterit. Pull up, Ben, and come in; sister says you'll getcold," shouted Thorny, as the rider came canteringround after a leap over the lodge gate and backagain.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　So Ben pulled up, and the admiring boys and girlswere allowed to gather about him, loud in theirpraises as they examined the pretty mare and themythological character who lay easily on her back.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　He looked very little like the god of love now; forhe had lost one slipper and splashed his white legswith dew and dust, the crown had slipped down uponhis neck, and the paper wings hung in an apple-treewhere he had left them as he went by. No troublein recognizing Ben, now; but somehow he didn'twant to be seen, and, instead of staying to be praised,he soon slipped away, making Lita his excuse tovanish behind the curtain while the rest went into thehouse to have a finishing-off game of blindman's-buffin the big kitchen.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Well, Ben, are you satisfied?" asked Miss Celia,as she stayed a moment to unpin the remains of hisgauzy scarf and tunic.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Yes, 'm, thank you, it was tip-top.""But you look rather sober. Are you tired, or isit because vou don't want to take these trappings offand be plain Ben again?" she said, looking downinto his face as he lifted it for her to free him fromhis gilded collar.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I want to take 'em off; for somehow I don't feelrespectable," and he kicked away the crown he hadhelped to make so carefully, adding with a glancethat said more than his words: "I'd rather be 'plainBen' than any one else, for you like to have me.""Indeed I do; and I'm so glad to hear you saythat, because I was afraid you'd long to be off to theold ways, and all I've tred to do would be undone.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Would you like to go back, Ben?" and Miss Celiaheld his chin an instant, to watch the brown face thatlooked so honestly back at her.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No, I wouldn't -- unless -- he was there andwanted me."The chin quivered just a bit, but the black eyeswere as bright as ever, and the boy's voice so earnest,she knew he spoke the truth, and laid her white handsoftly on his head, as she answered in the tone heloved so much, because no one else had ever used itto him, --"Father is not there; but I know he wants you,dear, and I am sure he would rather see you in ahome like this than in the place you came from. Nowgo and dress; but, tell me first, has it been a happybirthday?""Oh, Miss Celia! I didn't know they could be sobeautiful, and this is the beautifulest part of it;I don't know how to thank you, but I'm going to try --" and,finding words wouldn't come fast enough, Ben justput his two arms round her, quite speechless withgratitude; then, as if ashamed of his little outburst,he knelt down in a great hurry to untie his one shoe.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　But Miss Celia liked his answer better than thefinest speech ever made her, and went away throughthe moonlight, saying to herself, --"If I can bring one lost lamb into the fold, I shallbe the fitter for a shepherd's wife, by-and-by."
