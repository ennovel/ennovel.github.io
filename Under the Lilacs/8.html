None too soon, for in a day or two things arrived,to the great delight of the children, who considered movinga most interesting play. First came the phaeton, which Benspent all his leisure moments in admiring; wonderingwith secret envy what happy boy would ride in thelittle seat up behind, and beguiling his tasks by planninghow, when he got rich, he would pass his timedriving about in just such an equipage, and invitingall the boys he met to have a ride.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Then a load of furniture came creaking in at thelodge gate, and the girls had raptures over a cottagepiano, several small chairs, and a little low table, whichthey pronounced just the thing for them to play at.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The live stock appeared next, creating a great stirin the neighborhood, for peacocks were rare birdsthere; the donkey's bray startled the cattle and convulsedthe people with laughter; the rabbits werecontinually getting out to burrow in the newly madegarden; and Chevalita scandalized old Duke bydancing about the stable which he had inhabited foryears in stately solitude.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Last but by no means least, Miss Celia, her houngbrother, and two maids arrived one evening so latethat only Mrs. Moss went over to help them settle.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The children were much disappointed, but were appeasedby a promise that they should all go to paytheir respects in the morning.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　They were up so early, and were so impatient to beoff, that Mrs. Moss let them go with the warning thatthey would find only the servants astir. She was mistaken,however, for, as the procession approached, avoice from the porch called out, "Good-morninglittle neighbors!" so unexpectedly, that Bab nearlyspilt the new milk she carried, Betty gave such a startthat the fresh-laid eggs quite skipped in the dish, andBen's face broke into a broad grin over the armful ofclover which he brought for the bunnies, as he bobbedhis head, saying briskly, --"She's all right, miss, Lita is; and I can bring herover any minute you say.""I shall want her at four o'clock. Thorny willbe too tired to drive, but I must hear from thepost-office, rain or shine;" and Miss Celia's prettycolor brightened as she spoke, either from somehappy thought or because she was bashful, for thehonest young faces before her plainly showed theiradmiration of the white-gowned lady under thehoneysuckles.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The appearance of Miranda, the maid, reminded thechildren of their errand; and having delivered theirofferings, they were about to retire in some confusion,when Miss Celia said pleasantly, --"I want to thank you for helping put things in suchnice order. I see signs of busy hands and feet bothinside the house and all about the grounds, and Iam very much obliged.""I raked the beds," said Ben, proudly eying theneat ovals and circles.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I swept all the paths," added Bab, with a reproachfulglance at several green sprigs fallen fromthe load of clover on the smooth walk.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I cleared up the porch," and Betty's clean pinaforerose and fell with a long sigh, as she surveyed the latesummer residence of her exiled family.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Miss Celia guessed the meaning of that sigh, andmade haste to turn it into a smile by asking anxiously, --"What has become of the playthings? I don't seethem anywhere.""Ma said you wouldn't want our duds round,so we took them all home," answered Betty, with awistful face.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"But I do want them round. I like dolls and toysalmost as much as ever, and quite miss the little 'duds'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　from porch and path. Suppose you come to tea withme to-night and bring some of them back? I shouldbe very sorry to rob you of your pleasant play-place.""Oh, yes, 'm, we'd love to come! and we'll bringour best things.""Ma always lets us have our shiny pitchers and thechina poodle when we go visiting or have company athome," said Bab and Betty, both speaking at once.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Bring what you like, and I'll hunt up my toys,too. Ben is to come also, and his poodle is especiallyinvited," added Miss Celia, as Sancho came andbegged before her, feeling that some agreeable projectwas under discussion.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Thank you, miss. I told them you'd be willingthey should come sometimes. They like this placeever so much, and so do I," said Ben, feeling thatfew spots combined so many advantages in the way ofclimbable trees, arched gates, half-a-dozen gables, andother charms suited to the taste of an aspiring youthwho had been a flying Cupid at the age of seven.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"So do I," echoed Miss Celia, heartily. "Ten yearsago I came here a little girl, and made lilac chainsunder these very bushes, and picked chickweed overthere for my bird, and rode Thorny in his baby-wagonup and down these paths. Grandpa lived here then,and we had fine times; but now they are all goneexcept us two.""We haven't got any father, either," said Bab, forsomething in Miss Celia's face made her feel as if acloud had come over the sun.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I have a first-rate father, if I only knew wherehe'd gone to," said Ben, looking down the path aseagerly as if one waited for him behind the locked gate.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You are a rich boy, and you are happy little girlsto have so good a mother; I've found that out already,"and the sun shone again as the young ladynodded to the neat, rosy children before her.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You may have a piece of her if you want to, 'causeyou haven't got any of your own," said Betty with apitiful look which made her blue eyes as sweet as twowet violets.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"So I will ! and you shall be my little sisters. Inever had any, and I'd love to try how it seems;"and Celia took both the chubby hands in hers,feeling ready to love every one this first bright morningin the new home, which she hoped to make a veryhappy one.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Bab gave a satisfied nod, and fell to examining therings upon the white hand that held her own. ButBetty put her arms about the new friend's neck, andkissed her so softly that the hungry feeling in MissCelia's heart felt better directly; for this was the foodit wanted, and Thorny had not learned yet to returnone half of the affection he received. Holding thechild close, she played with the yellow braids whileshe told them about the little German girls in theirfunny black-silk caps, short-waisted gowns, and woodenshoes, whom she used to see watering long webs oflinen bleaching on the grass, watching great flocks ofgeese, or driving pigs to market, knitting or spinningas they went.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Presently "Randa," as she called her stout maid,came to tell her that "Master Thorny couldn't waitanother minute;" and she went in to breakfast witha good appetite, while the children raced home tobounce in upon Mrs. Moss, talking all at once likelittle lunatics.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"The phaeton at four, -- so sweet in a beautifulwhite gown, -- going to tea, and Sancho and all thebaby things invited. Can't we wear our Sundayfrocks? A splendid new net for Lita. And she likesdolls. Goody, goody, won't it be fun!"With much difficulty their mother got a clear accountof the approaching festivity out of the eagermouths, and with still more diffculty, got breakfastinto them, for the children had few pleasures, and thisbrilliant prospect rather turned their heads.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Bab and Betty thought the day would never end,and cheered the long hours by expatiating on thepleasures in store for them, till their playmates weremuch afflicted because they were not going also. Atnoon their mother kept them from running over tothe old house lest they should be in the way; so theyconsoled themselves by going to the syringa bush atthe corner and sniffing the savory odors which camefrom the kitchen, where Katy, the cook, was evidentlymaking nice things for tea.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ben worked as if for a wager till four; then stoodover Pat while he curried Lita till her coat shone likesatin, then drove her gently down to the coach-house,where he had the satisfaction of harnessing her "allhis own self".
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Shall I go round to the great gate and wait foryou there, miss?" he asked, when all was ready,looking up at the porch, where the young lady stoodwatching him as she put on her gloves.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No, Ben, the great gate is not to be opened tillnext October. I shall go in and out by the lodge, andleave the avenue to grass and dandelions, meantime,"answered Miss Celia, as she stepped in and took thereins, with a sudden smile.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　But she did not start, even when Ben had shakenout the new duster and laid it neatly over her knees.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Isn't it all right now?" asked the boy, anxiously.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Not quite; I need one thing more. Can't youguess what it is?" and Miss Celia watched hisanxious face as his eyes wandered from the tips ofLita's ears to the hind-wheel of the phaeton, tryingto discover what had been omitted.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No, miss, I don't see -- " he began, much mortifiedto think he had forgotten any thing.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Wouldn't a little groom up behind improve theappearance of my turnout?" she said, with a lookwhich left no doubt in his mind that he was to be thehappy boy to occupy that proud perch.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　He grew red with pleasure, but stammered, as hehesitated, looking down at his bare feet and blueshirt, --"I ain't fit, miss; and I haven't got any otherclothes."Miss Celia only smiled again more kindly thanbefore, and answered, in a tone which he understoodbetter than her words, --"A great man said his coat-of-arms was a pair ofshirt-sleeves, and a sweet poet sang about a barefootedboy; so I need not be too proud to ride with one.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Up with you, Ben, my man, and let us be off, or weshall be late for our party."With one bound the new groom was in his place,sitting very erect, with his legs stiff, arms folded, andnose in the air, as he had seen real grooms sit behindtheir masters in fine dog-carts or carriages. Mrs.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Moss nodded as they drove past the lodge, and Bentouched his torn hat-brim in the most dignified manner,though he could not suppress a broad grin of delight,which deepened into a chuckle when Lita went off ata brisk trot along the smooth road toward town.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　It takes so little to make a child happy, it is a pitygrown people do not oftener remember it and scatterlittle bits of pleasure before the small people, as theythrow crumbs to the hungry sparrows. Miss Celiaknew the boy was pleased, but he had no words inwhich to express his gratitude for the great contentmentshe had given him. He could only beam at allhe met, smile when the floating ends of the gray veilblew against his face, and long in his heart to give thenew friend a boyish hug, as he used to do his dear'Melia when she was very good to him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　School was just out as they passed; and it was aspectacle, I assure you, to see the boys and girls stareat Ben up aloft in such state; also to see the superbindifference with which that young man regarded thevulgar herd who went afoot. He couldn't resist anaffable nod to Bab and Betty, for they stood underthe maple-tree, and the memory of their circulatinglibrary made him forget his dignity in his gratitude.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"We will take them next time, but now I want totalk to you," began Miss Celia, as Lita climbed thehill. "My brother has been ill, and I have broughthim here to get well. I want to do all sorts of thingsto amuse him, and I think you can help me in manyways. Would you like to work for me instead of theSquire?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I guess I would!" ejaculated Ben, so heartily thatno further assurances were needed, and Miss Celiawent on, well pleased: --"You see, poor Thorny is weak and fretful, anddoes not like to exert himself, though he ought to beout a great deal, and kept from thinking of his littletroubles. He cannot walk much yet, so I have awheeled chair to push him in; and the paths are so hard,it will be easy to roll him about. That will be one thingyou can do. Another is to take care of his pets till heis able to do it himself. Then you cantell him your adventures, and talk to him as only aboy can talk to a boy. That will amuse him when Iwant to write or go out; but I never leave him long,and hope he will soon be running about as well as therest of us. How does that sort of work look to you?""First-rate! I'll take real good care of the littlefeller, and do every thing I know to please him, andso will Sanch; he's fond of children," answered Ben,heartily, for the new place looked very inviting to him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Miss Celia laughed, and rather damped his ardorby her next words.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I don't know what Thorny would say to hear youcall him 'little.' He is fourteen, and appears to gettaller and taller every day. He seems like a child tome, because I am nearly ten years older than he is;but you needn't be afraid of his long legs and bigeyes, he is too feeble to do any harm; only youmustn't mind if he orders you about.""I'm used to that. I don't mind it if he won't callme a 'spalpeen,' and fire things at me," said Ben,thinking of his late trials with Pat.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I can promise that; and I am sure Thorny willlike you, for I told him your story, and he is anxiousto see 'the circus boy' as he called you. SquireAllen says I may trust you, and I am glad to do so,for it saves me much trouble to find what I want allready for me. You shall be well fed and clothed,kindly treated and honestly paid, if you like to staywith me.""I know I shall like it -- till father comes, anyway.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Squire wrote to Smithers right off, but hasn't got anyanswer yet. I know they are on the go now, so maybe we won't hear for ever so long," answered Ben,feeling less impatient to be off than before this fineproposal was made to him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I dare say; meantime, we will see how we get ontogether, and perhaps your father will be willingleave you for the summer if he is away. Now showme the baker's, the candy-shop, and the post-office,"said Miss Celia, as they rattled down the main streetof the village.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ben made himself useful; and when all the othererrands were done, received his reward in the shapeof a new pair of shoes and a straw hat with a streamingblue ribbon, on the ends of which shone silveryanchors. He was also allowed to drive home, whilehis new mistress read her letters. One particularlylong one, with a queer stamp on the envelope, sheread twice, never speaking a word till they got back.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Then Ben was sent off with Lita and the Squire'sletters, promising to get his chores done in timefor tea.
