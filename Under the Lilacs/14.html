But people were beginning to go in, and itwas impossible to delay when they came round tothe entrance.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ben felt that now "his foot was on his nativeheath," and the superb air of indifference with whichhe threw down his dollar at the ticket-office, carelesslyswept up the change, and strolled into the tentwith his hands in his pockets, was so impressive thateven big Sam repressed his excitement and meeklyfollowed their leader, as he led them from cage tocage, doing the honors as if he owned the whole concern.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Bab held tight to the flap of his jacket, staringabout her with round eyes, and listening withlittle gasps of astonishment or delight to the roaringof lions, the snarling of tigers, the chatter of themonkeys, the groaning of camels, and the music ofthe very brass band shut up in a red bin.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Five elephants were tossing their hay about in themiddle of the menagerie, and Billy's legs shook underhim as he looked up at the big beasts whose longnoses and small, sagacious eyes filled him with awe.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Sam was so tickled by the droll monkeys that theothers left him before the cage and went on to seethe zebra, "striped just like Ma's muslin gown," Babdeclared. But the next minute she forgot all abouthim in her raptures over the ponies and their tinycolts; especially one mite of a thing who lay asleepon the hay, such a miniature copy of its little mouse-coloredmamma that one could hardly believe it was alive.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Oh, Ben, I must feel of it! -- the cunning babyhorse!" and down went Bab inside the rope to patand admire the pretty creature, while its mothersmelt suspiciously at the brown hat, and baby lazilyopened one eye to see what was going on.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Come out of that, it isn't allowed" commandedBen, longing to do the same thing, but mindful of theproprieties and his own dignity.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Bab reluctantly tore herself away to find consolationin watching the young lions, who looked so likebig puppies, and the tigers washing their faces justas puss did.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"If I stroked 'em, wouldn't they purr?" sheasked, bent on enjoying herself, while Ben held herskirts lest she should try the experiment.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You'd better not go to patting them, or you'llget your hands clawed up. Tigers do purr like funwhen they are happy, but these fellers never are, andyou'll only see 'em spit and snarl," said Ben, leadingthe way to the humpy carrels, who were peacefullychewing their cud and longing for the desert,with a dreamy, far-away look in their mournful eyes.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Here, leaning on the rope, and scientifically bitinga straw while he talked, Ben played showman to hisheart's content till the neigh of a horse from thecircus tent beyond reminded him of the joys to come.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"We'd better hurry along and get good seats beforefolks begin to crowd. I want to sit near the curtainand see if any of Smitthers's lot are 'round.""I ain't going way off there; you can't see half sowell, and that big drum makes such a noise you can'thear yourself think," said Sam, who had rejoinedthem.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　So they settled in good places where they couldsee and hear all that went on in the ring and stillcatch glimpses of white horses, bright colors, and theglitter of helmets beyond the dingy red curtains. Bentreated Bab to peanuts and pop-corn like an indulgentparent, and she murmured protestations of undyinggratitude with her mouth full, as she sat blissfullybetween him and the congenial Billy.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Sancho, meantime, had been much excited by thefamiliar sights and sounds, and now was greatly exercisedin his doggish mind at the unusual proceedingof his master; for he was sure that they ought to bewithin there, putting on their costumes, ready to taketheir turn. He looked anxiously at Ben, sniffeddisdainfully at the strap as if to remind him that ascarlet ribbon ought to take its place, and poked peanutshells about with his paw as if searching for the letterswith which to spell his famous name.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I know, old boy, I know; but it can't be done.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　We've quit the busin'ess and must just look on. Nolarks for us this time, Sanch, so keep quiet and behave,'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　whispered Ben, tucking the dog away underthe seat with a sympathetic cuddle of the curly headthat peeped out from between his feet.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"He wants to go and cut up, don't he?" said Billy,"and so do you, I guess. Wish you were goingto. Wouldn't it be fun to see Ben showing off inthere?""I'd be afraid to have him go up on a pile of elephantsand jump through hoops like these folks," answeredBab, poring over her pictured play-bill withunabated relish.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Done it a hundred times, and I'd just like toshow you what I can do. They don't seem to haveany boys in this lot; shouldn't wonder if they'd takeme if I asked 'em," said Ben, moving uneasily on hisseat and casting wistful glances toward the inner tentwhere he knew he would feel more at home than inhis present place.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I heard some men say that it's against the law tohave small boys now; it's so dangerous and not goodfor them, this kind of thing. If that's so, you're donefor, Ben," observed Sam, with his most grown-up air,remembering Ben's remarks on "fat boys.""Don't believe a word of it, and Sanch and I couldgo this minute and get taken on, I'll bet. We are avaluable couple, and I could prove it if I chose to,"began Ben, getting excited and boastful.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Oh, see, they're coming! -- gold carriages andlovely horses, and flags and elephants, and everything, cried Bab, giving a clutch at Ben's arm asthe opening procession appeared headed by the band,tooting and banging till their faces were as red astheir uniforms.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Round and round they went till every one had seentheir fill, then the riders alone were left caracolingabout the ring with feathers flying, horses prancing,and performers looking as tired and indifferent as ifthey would all like to go to sleep then and there.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"How splendid!" sighed Bab, as they went dashing out,to tumble off almost before the horses stopped.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"That's nothing! You wait till you see the barebackriding and the 'acrobatic exercises,' " said Ben,quoting from the play-bill, with the air of one whoknew all about the feats to come, and could never besurprised any more.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"What are 'crowbackic exercises'?" asked Billy,thirsting for information.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Leaping and climbing and tumbling; you'll seeGeorge! what a stunning horse!" and Ben forgotevery thing else to feast his eyes on the handsomecreature who now came pacing in to dance, upsetand replace chairs, kneel, bow, and perform manywonderful or graceful feats, ending with a swift gallopwhile the rider sat in a chair on its back fanninghimself, with his legs crossed, as comfortably as youplease.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"That, now, is something like," and Ben's eyes shonewith admiration and envy as the pair vanished, and thepink and silver acrobats came leaping into the ring.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The boys were especially interested in this part,and well they might be; for strength and agility aremanly attributes which lads appreciate, and theselively fellows flew about like India-rubber balls, eachtrying to outdo the other, till the leader of the acrobatscapped the climax by turning a double somersaultover five elephants standing side by side.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"There, Sir, how's that for a jump?" asked Ben,rubbing his hands with satisfaction as his friendsclapped till their palms tingled.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"We'll rig up a spring-board and try it," saidBilly, fired with emulation.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Where'll you get your elephants?" asked Sam,scornfully. for gymnastics were not in his line.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You'll do for one," retorted Ben, and Billy andBab joined in his laugh so heartily that a rough-looking, man who sat behind them, hearing all theysaid, pronounced them a "jolly set," and kept his eyeon Sancho, who now showed signs of insubordination.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Hullo, that wasn't on the bill!" cried Ben, as aparti-colored clown came in, followed by half a dozendogs.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I'm so glad; now Sancho will like it. There's apoodle that might be his ownty donty brother -- theone with the blue ribbon," said Bab. beaming with delightas the dogs took their seats in the chairs arrangedfor them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Sancho did like it only too well, for be scrambledout from under the seat in a great hurry to go andgreet his friends; and, being sharply checked, sat upand begged so piteously that Ben found it very hardto refuse and order him down. He subsided for amoment, but when the black spaniel, who acted thecanine clown, did something funny and was applauded,Sancho made a dart as if bent on leaping into thering to outdo his rival, and Ben was forced to boxhis ears and put his feet on the poor beast, fearing hewould be ordered out if he made any disturbance.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Too well trained to rebel again, Sancho lay meditatingon his wrongs till the dog act was over, carefullyabstaining from any further sign of interest intheir tricks, and only giving a sidelong g;ance at thetwo little poodles who came out of a basket to runup and down stairs on their fore-paws, dance jigs ontheir hind-legs, and play various pretty pranks to thegreat delight of all the children in the audience. Ifever a dog expressed by look and attitude, "Pooh!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　I could fo much better than that, and astonish youall, if I were only allowed to," that dog was Sancho,as he curled himself up and affected to turn his backon an unappreciative world.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It's too bad, when he knows motr than all thosechaps put together. I'd give any thing if I couldshow him off as I used to. Folks always like it, andI was ever so proud of him. He's mad now becauseI had to cuff him, and won't take any notice of metill I make up," said Ben, regretfully eying his offendedfriend, but not daring to beg pardon yet.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　More riding followed, and Bab was kept in a breathlessstate by the marvellous agility and skill of thegauzy lady who drove four horses at once, leapedthrough hoops, over banners and bars, sprang off andon at full speed, and seemed to enjoy it all so muchit was impossible to believe that there could be anydanger or exertion in it. Then two girls flew abouton the trapeze, and walked on a tight rope, causingBab to feel that she had at last found her sphere; for,young as she was, her mother often said,"I really don't know what this child is fit for, exceptmischief, like a monkey.""I'll fix the clothes-line when I get home, andshow Ma how nice it is. Then, may be, she'd let mewear red and gold trousers, and climb round likethese girls," thought the busy little brain, much excitedby all it saw on that memorable day.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Nothing short of a pyramid of elephants with aglittering gentleman in a turban and top boots on thesummit would have made her forget this new andcharming plan. But that astonishing spectacle, andthe prospect of a cage of Bengal tigers with a manamong them, in immenent danger of being eatenbefore her eyes, entirely absorbed her thoughts till,just as the big animals went lumbering out, a peal ofthunder caused considerable commotion in the audience.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Men on the highest seats popped their headsthrough the openings in the tent-cover and reportedthat a heavy shower was coming up. Anxious mothersbegan to collect their flocks of children as hens dotheir chickens at sunset; timid people told cheerfulstories of tents blown over in gales, cages upset andwild beasts let loose. Many left in haste, and theperformers hurried to finish as soon as possible.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I'm going now before the crowd comes, so I canget a lift home. I see two or three folks I know, soI'm off;" and, climbing hastily down, Sam vanishedwithout further ceremony.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Better wait till the shower is over. We can goand see the animals again, and get home all dry, justas well as not," observed Ben, encouraginly, as Billylooked anxiously at the billowing canvas over hishead, the swaying posts before him, and heard thequick patter of drops outside, not to mention themelancholy roar of the lion which sounded rather awfulthrough the sudden gloom which filled the strangeplace.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I wouldn't miss the tigers for any thing. See,they are pulling in the cart now, and the shiny manis all ready with his gun. Will he shoot any of them,apprehension, for the sharp crack of a rifle startled hermore than the loudest thunder-clap she ever heard.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Bless you, no, child; it 's only powder to makea noise and scare 'em. I wouldn't like to be in hisplace, though; father says you can never trust tiglersas you can lions, no matter how tame they are. Slyfellers, like cats, and when they scratch it's no joke,I tell you," answered Ben, with a knowing wag of thehead, as the sides of the cage rattled down, and thepoor, fierce creatures were seen leaping and snarlingas if they resented this display of their captivity.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Bab curled up her feet and winked fast with excitementas she watched the "shiny man" fondle thegreat cats, lie down among them, pull open their redmouths, and make them leap over him or crouch athis feet as be snapped the long whip. When he firedthe gun and they all fell as if dead, she with difficultysuppressed a small scream and clapped her handsover her ears; but poor Billy never minded it a bit,for he was pale and quaking with the fear of "heaven'sartillery" thundering overhead, and as a brighht flashof lightning seemed to run down the tall tent-poles hehid his eyes and wished with all his heart that he wassafe with mother.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Afraid of thunder, Bill?" asked Ben, trying tospeak stoutly, while a sense of his own responsibilitiesbegan to worry him, for how was Bab to be got homein such a pouring rain?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It makes me sick; always did. Wish I hadn'tcome," sighed Billy, feeling, all too late, that lemonadeand "lozengers" were not the fittest food for man, ora stifling tent the best place to be in on a hot Julyday, especially in a thunder-storm.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I didn't ask you to come; you asked me; so itisn't my fault," said Ben, rather gruffly, as peoplecrowded by without pausing to hear the comic songthe clown was singing in spite of the confusion.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Oh, I'm so tired," groaned Bab, getting up witha long stretch of arms and legs.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You'll be tireder before you get home, I guess.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Nobody asked you to Come, any way;" and Bengazed dolefully round him, wishing he could see afamiliar face or find a wiser head than his own to helphim out of the scrape he was in.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I said I wouldn't be a bother, and I won't. I'llwalk right home this minute. I ain't afraid of thunder,and the rain won't hurt these old clothes. Comealong," cried Bab, bravely, bent on keeping her word,though it looked much harder after the fun was allover than before.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"My head aches like fury. Don't I wish old Jackwas here to take me back," said Billy, following hiscompanions in misfortune with sudden energy, as alouder peal than before rolled overhead.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You might as well wish for Lita and the coveredwagon while you are about it, then we could all ride,"answered Ben, leading the way to the outer tent, wheremany people were lingering in hopes of fair weather.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Why, Billy Barton, how in the world did you gethere? " cried a surprised voice as the crook of a canecaught the boy by the collar and jerkcd him face toface with a young farmer, who was pushing along,followed by his, wife and two or three children.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Oh, Uncle Eben, I'm so glad you found Me! Iwalked over, and it's raining, and I don't feel well.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Let me go with you, can't I? " asked Billy, castinghimself and all his woes upon the strong arm thathad laid hold of him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Don't see what your mother was about to let youcome so far alone, and you just over scarlet fever.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　We are as full as ever we can be, but we'll tuck youin somehow," said the pleasant-faced woman, bundlingup her baby, and bidding the two little lads"keep close to father.""I didn't come alone. Sam got a ride, and can'tyou tuck Ben and Bab in too? They ain't very big,either of them," whispeied Billy, anxious to serve hisfriends now that he was provided for himself.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Can't do it, any way. Got to pick up mother atthe corner, and that will be all I can carry. It'slifting a little; hurry along, Lizzie, and let us getout of this as quick is possible," said Uncle Eben,impatiently; for going to a circus with a youngfamily is not an easy task, as every one knows whohas ever tried it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Ben, I'm real sorry there isn't room for you.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　I'll tell Bab's mother where she is, and may be someone will come for you," said Billy, hurriedly, as hetore himself away, feeling rather mean to desert theothers, though he could be of no use.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Cut away, and don't mind us. I'm all right, andBab must do the best she can," was all Ben had timeto answer before his comrade was hustled away bythe crowd pressing round the entrance with muchclashing of umbrellas and scrambling of boys andmen, who rather enjoyed the flurry.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No use for us to get knocked about in thatscrimmage. We'll wait a minute and then go outeasy. It's a regular rouser, and you'll be as wet asa sop before we get home. Hope you'll like that?"added Ben, looking out at the heavy rain poringdown as if it never meant to stop.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Don't care a bit," said Bab, swinging on one ofthe ropes with a happy-go-lucky air, for her spiritswere not extinguished yet, and she was bound toenjoy this exciting holiday to the very end. "I likecircuses so much! I wish I lived here all the time,and slept in a wagon, as you did, and had these dearlittle colties to play with.""It wouldn't be fun if you didn't have any folksto take care of you," began Ben, thoughtfully lookingabout the familiar place where the men were nowfeeding the animals, setting their refreshment tables,or lounging on the hay to get such rest as theycould before the evening entertainment. Suddenlyhe started, gave a long look, then turned to Bab, andthrusting Sancho's strap into her hand, said, hastily:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I see a fellow I used to know. May be he can tellme something about father. Don't you stir till Icome back."Then he was off like a shot, and Bab saw him runafter a man with a bucket who bad been watering thezebra. Sancho tried to follow, but was checked withan impatient,--"No, you can't go! What a plague you are,tagging around when people don't want you."Sancho might have answered, "So are you," but,being a gentlemanly dog, he sat down with a resignedexpression to watch the little colts, who were nowawake and seemed ready for a game of bo-peep behindtheir mammas. Bab enjoyed their funny littlefrisks so much that she tied the wearisome strap toa post, and crept under the rope to pet the tinymouse-colored one who came and talked to her withbaby whinnies and confiding glances of its soft, darkeyes.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Oh, luckless Bab! why did you turn your back?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Oh, too accomplished Sancho! why did you neatlyuntie that knot and trot away to confer with the disreputablebull-dog who stood in the entrance beckoning withfriendly wavings of an abbreviated tail?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Oh, much afflicted Ben! why did you delay till itwas too late to save your pet from the rough manwho set his foot upon the trailing strap, and led poorSanch quickly out of sight among the crowd?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It was Bascum, but he didn't know any thing.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Why, where's Sanch?" said Ben, returning.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　A breathless voice made Bab turn to see Benlooking about him with as much alarm in his hotface as if the dog had been a two years' child.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I tied him -- he's here somewhere --ith theponies," stammered Bab, in sudden dismay, for nosign of a dog appeared as her eyes roved wildly toand fro.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ben whistled, called and searched in vain, till oneof the lounging men said, lazily,"If you are looking after the big poodle you'dbetter go outside; I saw him trotting off with anotherdog."Away rushed Ben, with Bab following, regardlessof the rain, for both felt that a great misfortune hadbefallen them. But, long before this, Sancho hadvanished, and no one minded his indignant howls ashe was driven off in a covered cart.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"If he is lost I'll never forgive you; never, never,never!" and Ben found it impossible to resist givingBab several hard shakes, which made her yellowbraids fly up and down like pump handles.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I'm dreadful sorry. He'll come back -- yousaid he always did," pleaded Bab, quite crushed byher own afflictions, and rather scared to see Ben lookso fierce, for he seldom lost his temper or was roughwith the little girls.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;

 　　"If he doesn't come back, don't you speak to mefor a year. Now, I'm going home." And, feelingthat words were powerless to express his emotions,Ben walked away, looking as grim as a small boycould.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　A more unhappy little lass is seldom to be foundthan Bab was, as she pattered after him, splashingrecklessly through the puddles, and getting as wetand muddy as possible, as a sort of penance for hersins. For a mile or two she trudged stoutly along,while Ben marched before in solemn silence, whichsoon became both impressive and oppressive becauseso unnsual, and such a proof of his deep displeasure.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Penitent Bab longed for just one word, one sign ofrelenting; and when none came, she began to wonderhow she could possibly bear it if he kept his dreadfulthreat and did not speak to her for a whole year.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　But presently her own discomfort absorbed her,for her feet were wet and cold as well as very tired;pop-corn and peanuts were not particularly nourishing food;and hunger made her feel faint; excitementwas a new thing, and now that it was over she longedto lie down and go to sleep; then the long walk witha circus at the end seemed a very different affair fromthe homeward trip with a distracted mother awaitingher. The shower had subsided into a dreary drizzle,a chilly east wind blew up, the hilly road seemed tolengthen before the weary feet, and the mute, blueflannel figure going on so fast with never a lookor sound, added the last touch to Bab's remorsefulanguish.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Wagons passed, but all were full, and no one offereda ride. Men and boys went by with rough jokes onthe forlorn pair, for rain soon made them look likeyoung tramps. But there was no brave Sancho toresent the impertinence, and this fact was sadlybrought to both their minds by the appearance of agreat Newfoundland dog who came trotting after acarriage. The good creature stopped to say a friendlyword in his dumb fashion, looking up at Bab withbenevolent eyes, and poking his nose into Ben's handbefore he bounded away with his plumy tail curledover his back.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ben started as the cold nose touched his fingers,gave the soft head a lingering pat, and watched thedog out of sight through a thicker mist than any therain made. But Bab broke down; for the wistful lookof the creature's eyes reminded her of lost Sancho,and she sobbed quietly as she glanced back longingto see the dear old fellow jogging along in the rear.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ben heard the piteous sound and took a sly peepover his shoulder, seeing such a mournful spectaclethat he felt appeased, saying to himself as if to excusehis late sternness, --"She is a naughty girl, but I guess she is aboutsorry enough now. When we get to that sign-postI'll speak to her, only I won't forgive her till Sanchcomes back."But he was better than his word; for, just beforethe post was reached, Bab, blinded by tears, trippedover the root of a tree, and, rolling down the bank,landed in a bed of wet nettles. Ben had her out in ajiffy, and vainly tried to comfort her; but she waspast any consolation he could offer, and roared dismallyas she wrung her tingling hands, with greatdrops running over her cheeks almost as fast as themuddy little rills ran down the road.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Oh dear, oh dear! I'm all stinged up, and I wantmy supper; and my feet ache, and I'm cold, andevery thing is so horrid!" wailed the poor child lyingon the grass, such a miserable little wet bunch thatthe sternest parent would have melted at the sight.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Don't cry so, Babby; I was real cross, and I'msorry. I'll forgive you right away now, and nevershake you any more," cried Ben, so full of pity forher tribulations that he forgot his own, like agenerous little man.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Shake me again, if you want to; I know I wasvery bad to tag and lose Sanch. I never will anymore, and I'm so sorry, I don't know what to do,"answered Bab, completely bowed down by this magnanimity.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Never mind; you just wipe up your face and comealong, and we'll tell Ma all about it, and she'll fix usas nice as can be. I shouldn't wonder if Sanch gothome now before we did," said Ben, cheering himselfas well as her by the fond hope.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I don't believe I ever shall. I'm so tired my legswon't go, and the water in my boots makes them feeldreadfully. I wish that boy would wheel me a piece.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Don't you s'pose he would? asked Bab, wearily pickingherself up as a tall lad trundling a barrow cameout of a yard near by.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Hullo, Joslyn!" said Ben, recognizing the boy asone of the "hill fellows" who came to town Saturdaynights for play or business.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Hullo, Brown! " responded the other, arrestinghis squeaking progress with signs of surprise at themoist tableau before him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Where goin'? " asked Ben with masculine brevity.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Got to carry this home, hang the old thing.""Where to?""Batchelor's, down yonder," and the boy pointedto a farm-house at the foot of the next hill.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Goin' that way, take it right along.""What for?" questioned the prudent youth,distrusting such unusual neighborliness.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"She's tired, wants a ride; I'll leave it all right,true as I live and breathe," explained Ben, halfashamed yet anxious to get his little responsibilityhome as soon as possible, for mishaps seemed tothicken.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Ho, you couldn't cart her all that way! she'smost as heavy as a bag of meal," jeered the taller lad,amused at the proposition.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I'm stronger than most fellers of my size. Try,if I ain't," and Ben squared off in such scientific stylethat Joslyn responded with sudden amiability, --"All right, let's see you do it."Bab huddled into her new equipage without theleast fear, and Ben trundled her off at a good pace,while the boy retired to the shelter of a barn to watchtheir progress, glad to be rid of an irksome errand.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　At first, all went well, for the way was down hill,and the wheel squeaked briskly round and round;Bab smiled gratefully upon her bearer, and Ben"went in on his muscle with a will," as he expressedit. But presently the road grew sandy, began toascend, and the load seemed to grow heavier withevery step.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I'll get out now. It's real nice, but I guess I amtoo heavy," said Bab, as the face before her got redderand redder, and the breath began to come in puffs.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Sit still. He said I couldn't. I'm not going togive in with him looking on," panted Ben, and hepushed gallantly up the rise, over the grassy lawn tothe side gate of the Batchelors' door-yard, with hishead down, teeth set, and every muscle of his slenderbody braced to the task.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Did ever ye see the like of that now? Ah, ha!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"The streets were so wide, and the lanes were so narry,He brought his wife home on a little wheelbarry,"sung a voice with an accent which made Ben drop hisload and push back his hat, to see Pat's red headlooking over the fence.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　To have his enemy behold him then and there wasthe last bitter drop in poor Ben's cup of humiliation.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　A shrill approving whistle from the hill was somecomfort, however, and gave him spirit to help Babout with composure, though his hands were blisteredand he had hardly breath enough to issue the Command, --"Go along home, and don't mind him.""Nice childer, ye are, runnin' off this way, settin'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　the women distracted, and me wastin' me time comin'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　after ye when I'd be milkin' airly so I'd get a bit ofpleasure the day," grumbled Pat, coming up to untiethe Duke, whose Roman nose Ben had already recognized,as well as the roomy chaise standing before thedoor.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Did Billy tell you about us?" asked Bab, gladlyfollowing toward this welcome refuge.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Faith he did, and the Squire sent me to fetch yehome quiet and aisy. When ye found me, I'd jiststopped here to borry a light for me pipe. Up widye, b'y, and not be wastin' me time stramashin' after aspalpeen that I'd like to lay me whip over," said Pat,gruffly, as Ben came along, having left the barrow inthe shed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Don't you wish you could? You needn't waitfor me; I'll come when I'm ready," answered Bendodging round the chaise, bound not to mind Pat, ifhe spent the night by the road-side in consequence.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Bedad, and I won't then. It's lively ye are; butfour legs is better than two, as ye'll find this night,me young man."With that he whipped up and was off before Babcould say a word to persuade Ben to humble himselffor the sake of a ride. She lamented and Pat chuckled,both forgetting what an agile monkey the boy was,and as neither looked back, they were unawareMaster Ben was hanging on behind among the strapsand springs, making derisive grimaces at his unconsciousfoe through the little glass in the leathernback.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　At the lodge gate Ben jumped down to run beforewith whoops of naughty satisfaction, which broughtthe anxious waiters to the door in a flock; so Patcould only shake his fist at the exulting little rascalas he drove away, leaving the wanderers to bewelcomed as warmly as if they were a pair of modelchildren.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Mrs. Moss had not been very much troubled afterall; for Cy had told her that Bab went after Ben, andBilly had lately reported her safe arrival among them,so, mother-like, she fed, dried, and warmed the runaways,before she scolded them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Even then, the lecture was a mild one, for whenthey tried to tell the adventures which to them seemedso exciting, not to say tragical, the effect astonishedthem immensely, as their audience went into gales oflaughter, especially at the wheelbarrow episode, whichPat insisted on telling, with grateful minuteness, toBen's confusion. Thorny shouted, and even tender-hearted Betty forgot her tears over the lost dog tojoin in the familiar melody when Bab mimicked Pat'squotation from Mother Goose.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"We must not laugh any more, or these naughtychildren will think they have done something veryclever in running away," said Miss Celia, when thefun subsided, adding, soberly, "I am displeased, butI will say nothing, for I think Ben is already punishedenough.""Guess I am," muttered Ben, with a choke in hisvoice as he glanced towaid the empty mat where adear curly bunch used to he with a bright eye twinklingout of the middle of it.
