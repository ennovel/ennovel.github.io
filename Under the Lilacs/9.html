<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　No one was visible to receive them, but the lowtable stood in the middle of the walk, with four chairsand a foot-stool around it. A pretty set of green andwhite china caused the girls to cast admiring looksupon the little cups and plates, while Ben eyed thefeast longingly, and Sancho with difficulty restrainedhimself from repeating his former naughtiness. Nowonder the dog sniffed and the children smiled, forthere was a noble display of little tarts and cakes,little biscuits and sandwiches, a pretty milk-pitchershaped like a white calla rising out of its green leaves,and a jolly little tea-kettle singing away over thespirit-lamp as cosily as you please.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Isn't it perfectly lovely?" whispered Betty, whohad never seen any thing like it before.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I just wish Sally could see us now," answered Bab,who had not yet forgiven her enemy.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Wonder where the boy is," added Ben, feelingas good as any one, but rather doubtful how othersmight regard him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Here a rumbling sound caused the guests to looktoward the garden, and in a moment Miss Celia appeared,pushing a wheeled chair, in which sat herbrother. A gay afghan covered the long legs, abroad-brimmed hat half hid the big eyes, and a discontentedexpression made the thin face as unattractive as thefretful voice, which said, complainingly, --"If they make a noise, I'll go in. Don't see whatyou asked them for.""To amuse you, dear. I know they will, if youwill only try to like them," whispered the sister, smiling,and nodding over the chair-back as she came on,adding aloud, "Such a punctual party! I am allready, however, and we will sit down at once. Thisis my brother Thornton, and we are all going to bevery good friends by-and-by. Here 's the droll dog,Thorny; isn't he nice and curly?"Now, Ben had heard what the other boy said, andmade up his mind that he shouldn't like him; andThorny had decided beforehand that he wouldn'tplay with a tramp, even if he cut capers; goboth looked decidedly cool and indifferent when MissCelia introduced them. But Sancho had better mannersand no foolish pride; he, therefore, set them a goodexample by approaching the chair, with his tail wavinglike a flag of truce, and politely presented hisruffled paw for a hearty shake.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Thorny could not resist that appeal, and patted thewhite head, with a friendly look into the affectionateeyes of the dog, saying to his sister as he did so, --"What a wise old fellow he is! It seems as if hecould almost speak, doesn't it?""He can. Say 'How do you do,' Sanch," commanded Ben,relenting at once, for he saw admiration in Thorny's face.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Wow, wow, wow!" remarked Sancho, in a mildand conversational tone, sitting up and touching onepaw to his head, as if he saluted by taking off his hat.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Thorny laughed in spite of himself, and Miss Celiaseeing that the ice was broken, wheeled him to hisplace at the foot of the table. Then, seating the littlegirls on one side, Ben and the dog on the other, tookthe head herself and told her guests to begin.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Bab and Betty were soon chattering away to theirpleasant hostess as freely as if they had known her formonths; but the boys were still rather shy, and madeSancho the medium through which they addressedone another. The excellent beast behaved with wonderfulpropriety, sitting upon his cushion in an attitude of suchdignity that it seemed almost a libertyto offer him food.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　A dish of thick sandwiches had been provided for his especialrefreshment; and, as Ben from time to time laid one on hisplate, he affected entire unconsciousness of it till the wordwas given, when it vanished at one gulp, and Sancho againappeared absorbed in deep thought.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　But, having once tasted of this pleasing delicacy, itwas very hard to repress his longing for more; and, inspite of all his efforts, his nose would work, his eyekept a keen watch upon that particular dish, and histail quivered with excitement as it lay like a trainover the red cushion. At last, a moment came whentemptation proved too strong for him. Ben waslistening to something Miss Celia said; a tart layunguarded upon his plate; Sanch looked at Thornywho was watching him; Thorny nodded, Sanch gaveone wink, bolted the tart, and then gazed pensivelyup at a sparrow swinging on a twig overhead.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The slyness of the rascal tickled the boy so muchthat he pushed back his hat, clapped his hands,and burst out laughing as he had not done beforefor weeks. Every one looked round surprised, andSancho regarded them with a mildly inquiring air, asif he said, "Why this unseemly mirth, my friends?"Thorny forgot both sulks and shyness after that,and suddenly began to talk. Ben was flattered by hisinterest in the dear dog, and opened out so delightfullythat he soon charmed the other by his livelytales of circus-life. Then Miss Celia felt relieved, andevery thing went splendidly, especially the food; forthe plates were emptied several times, the little tea-potran dry twice, and the hostess was just wonderingif she ought to stop her voracious guests, when somethingoccurred which spared her that painful task.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　A small boy was suddenly discovered standing inthe path behind them, regarding the company withan air of solemn interest. A pretty, well-dressed childof six, with dark hair cut short across the brow, arosy face, a stout pair of legs, left bare by the sockswhich had slipped down over the dusty little shoes.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　One end of a wide sash trailed behind him, a strawhat hung at his back, his right hand firmlygrasped a small turtle, and his left a choice collectionof sticks. Before Miss Celia could speak, the strangercalmly announced his mission.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I have come to see the peacocks.""You shall presently --" began Miss Celia, but gotno further, for the child added, coming a step nearer,--"And the wabbits.""Yes, but first won't you --""And the curly dog," continued the small voice,as another step brought the resolute young personagenearer.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"There he is."A pause, a long look; then a new demand with thesame solemn tone, the same advance.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I wish to hear the donkey bray.""Certainly, if he will.""And the peacocks scream.""Any thing more, sir?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Having reached the table by this time, the insatiableinfant surveyed its ravaged surface, then pointed a fatlittle finger at the last cake, left for manners, and said,commandingly, --"I will have some of that.""Help yourself; and sit upon the step to eat it,while you tell me whose boy you are," said MissCelia, much amused at his proceedings.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Deliberately putting down his sticks, the child tookthe cake, and, composing himself upon the step, answeredwith his rosy mouth full, --"I am papa's boy. He makes a paper. I helphim a great deal.""What is his name?""Mr. Barlow. We live in Springfield," volunteeredthe new guest, unbending a trifle, thanks to the charmsof the cake.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Have you a mamma, dear?""She takes naps. I go to walk then.""Without leave, I suspect. Have you no brothers orsisters to go with you?" asked Miss Celia, wonderingwhere the little runaway belonged.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I have two brothers, Thomas Merton Barlowand Harry Sanford Barlow. I am Alfred TennysonBarlow. We don't have any girls in our house, onlyBridget.""Don't you go to school?""The boys do. I don't learn any Greeks andLatins yet. I dig, and read to mamma, and makepoetrys for her.""Couldn't you make some for me? I'm very fondof poetrys," proposed Miss Celia, seeing that thisprattle amused the children.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I guess I couldn't make any now; I made somecoming along. I will say it to you."And, crossing his short legs, the inspired babe halfsaid, half sung the following poem: (1)"Sweet are the flowers of life,Swept o'er my happy days at home;Sweet are the flowers of lifeWhen I was a little child.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Sweet are the flowers of lifeThat I spent with my father at home;Sweet are the flowers of lifeWhen children played about the house.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Sweet are the flowers of lifeWhen the lamps are lighted at night;Sweet are the flowers of lifeWhen the flowers of summer bloomed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Sweet are the flowers of lifeDead with the snows of winter;Sweet are the flowers of lifeWhen the days of spring come on.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　(1) These lines were actually composed by a six-yearold child.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"That's all of that one. I made another one whenI digged after the turtle. I will say that. It is avery pretty one," observed the poet with charmingcandor; and, taking a long breath, he tuned his littlelyre afresh:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Sweet, sweet days are passingO'er my happy home.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Passing on swift wings through the valley of life.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Cold are the days when winter comes again.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　When my sweet days were passing at my happy home,Sweet were the days on the rivulet's green brink ;Sweet were the days when I read my father's books;Sweet were the winter days when bright fires are blazing.""Bless the baby! where did he get all that?" exclaimedMiss Celia, amazed; while the children giggled as Tennyson,Jr., took a bite at the turtle instead of the half-eaten cake,and then, to prevent further mistakes, crammed the unhappycreature into a diminutive pocket in the most business-like wayimaginable.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It comes out of my head. I make lots of them,"began the imperturbable one, yielding more and moreto the social influences of the hour.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Here are the peacocks coming to be fed," interrupted Bab, asthe handsome birds appeared with their splendid plumageglittering in the sun.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Young Barlow rose to admire; but his thirst forknowledge was not yet quenched, and he was aboutto request a song from Juno and Jupiter, when oldJack, pininng for society, put his head over the gardenwall with a tremendous bray.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　This unexpected sound startled the inquiringstranger half out of his wits; for a moment the stoutlegs staggered and the solemn countenance lost itscomposure, as he whispered, with an astonished air,"Is that the way peacocks scream?"The children were in fits of laughter, and MissCelia could hardly make herself heard as she answeredmerrily, --"No, dear; that is the donkey asking you to comeand see him: will you go?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I guess I couldn't stop now. Mamma might wantme."And, without another word, the discomfited poetprecipitately retired, leaving his cherished sticksbehind him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ben ran after the child to see that he came to noharm, and presently returned to report that Alfredhad been met by a servant, and gone away chanting anew verse of his poem, in which peacocks, donkeys,and "the flowers of life" were sweetly mingled.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Now I'll show you my toys, and we';; have alittle play before it gets too late for Thorny to staywith us," said Miss Celia, as Randa carried away thetea-things and brought back a large tray full ofpicture-books, dissected maps, puzzles, games, andseveral pretty models of animals, the whole crownedwith a large doll dressed as a baby.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　At sight of that, Betty stretched out her arms toreceive it with a cry of delight. Bab seized the games,and Ben was lost in admiration of the little Arab chiefprancing on the white horse, -- all saddled and bridledand fit for the fight. Thorny poked about to find acertain curious puzzle which he could put togetherwithout a mistake after long study. Even Sanchofound something to interest him; and, standing on hishind-legs, thrust his head between the boys to pawat several red and blue letters on square blocks.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"He looks as if he knew them," said Thorny,amused at the dog's eager whine and scratch.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"He does. Spell your name, Sanch;" and Ben putall the gay letters down upon the flags with a chirrupwhich set the dog's tail to wagging as he waited till thealphabet was spread before him. Then, with greatdeliberation, he pushed the letters about till he hadpicked out six; these he arranged with nose andpaw till the word "Sancho" lay before him correctlyspelt.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Isn't that clever? Can he do any more?" criedThorny, delighted.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Lots; that's the way he gets his livin', and minetoo," answered Ben; and proudly put his poodlethrough his well-learned lessons sith Such successthat even Miss Celia was surprised.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"He has been carefully trained. Do you know howit was done?" she asked, when Sancho lay down torest and be caressed by the children.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No, 'm, father did it when I was a little chap, andnever told me how. I used to help teach him to dance,and that was easy enough, he is so smart. Father saidthe middle of the night was the best time to give himhis lessons; it was so still then, and nothing disturbedSanch and made him forget. I can't do half the tricks,but I'm goin' to learn when father comes back. He'drather have me show off Sanch than ride, till I'molder.""I have a charming book about animals, and in it aninteresting account of some trained poodles who coulddo the most wonderful things. Would you like to hearit while you put your maps and puzzles together?"asked Miss Celia, glad to keep her brother interestedin their four-footed guest at least.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Yes,'m, yes,'m," answered the children; and, fetchingthe book, she read the pretty account, shorteningand simplifying it here and there to suit her hearers.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I invited the two dogs to dine and spend theevening; and they came with their master, who was aFrenchman. He had been a teacher in a deaf anddumb school, and thought he would try the same planwith dogs. He had also been a conjurer, and now wassupported by Blanche and her daughter Lyda. Thesedogs behaved at dinner just like other dogs; but whenI gave Blanche a bit of cheese and asked if she knewthe word for it, her master said she could spell it. Soa table was arranged with a lamp on it, and round thetable were laid the letters of the alphabet painted oncards. Blanche sat in the middle, waiting till hermaster told her to spell cheese, which she at oncedid in French, F R O M A G E. Then she translated aword for us very cleverly. Some one wrote pferd, theGerman for horse, on a slate. Blanche looked at it andpretended to read it, putting by the slate with her pawwhen she had done. 'Now give us the French for thatword,' said the man; and she instantly broughtCHEVAL. 'Now, as you are at an Englishman'shouse, give it to us in English;' and she brought meHORSE. Then we spelt some words wrong, and shecorrected them with wonderful accuracy. But she didnot seem to like it, and whined and growled and lookedso worried, that she was allowed to go and rest and eatcakes in a corner.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Then Lyda took her place on the table, and didsums on the slate with a set of figures. Also mentalarithmetic, which was very pretty. 'Now, Lyda,'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　said her master, 'I want to see if you understanddivision. Suppose you had ten bits of sugar, and youmet ten Prussian dogs, how many lumps would you, aFrench dog, give to each of the Prussians?' Lydavery decidedly replied to this with a cipher. 'But,suppose you divided your sugar with me, how manylumps would you give me?' Lyda took up the figurefive and politely presented it to her master.""Wasn't she smart? Sanch can't do that," exclaimedBen, forced to own that the French doggiebeat his cherished pet.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"He is not too old to learn. Shall I go on?"asked Miss Celia, seeing that the boys liked it, thoughBetty was absorbed with the doll, and Bab deep in apuzzle.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Oh, yes! What else did they do?""They played a game of dominoes together, sittingin chairs opposite each other, and touched the dominoesthat were wanted; but the man placed them andkept telling how the game went. Lyda was beaten,and hid under the sofa, evidently feeling very badlyabout it. Blanche was then surrounded with playing-cards,while her master held another pack and told us to choosea card; then he asked her what one had been chosen, andshe always took up the right one in her teeth. I was askedto go into another room, put a light on the floor with cardsround it, and leave the doors nearly shut. Then the manbegged some one to whisper in the dog's ear what card shewas to bring, and she went at once and fetched it, thus showingthat she understood their names. Lyda did many trickswith the numbers, so curious that no dog could possiblyunderstand them; yet what the secret sign was I couldnot discover, but suppose it must have been in thetones of the master's voice, for he certainly made nonewith either head or hands.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It took an hour a day for eighteen months toeducate a dog enough to appear in public, and (asyou say, Ben) the night was the best time to give thelessons. Soon after this visit, the master died; andthese wonderful dogs were sold because their mistressdid not know how to exhibit them.""Wouldn't I have liked to see 'em and find out howthey were taught! Sanch, you'll have to study uplively, for I'm not going to have you beaten by Frenchdogs," said Ben, shaking his finger so sternly thatSancho grovelled at his feet and put both paws overhis eyes in the most abject manner.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Is there a picture of those smart little poodles?"asked Ben, eying the book, which Miss Celia left openbefore her.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Not of them, but of other interesting creatures;also anecdotes about horses, which will please you,I know," and she turned the pages for him, neitherguessing how much good Mr. Hamerton's charmingChapters on Animals" were to do the boy when heneeded comfort for a sorrow which was very near.
