Two devoted little maids waited on her,two eager pages stood ready to run her errands, andfriendly neighbors sent in delicacies enough to keepthese four young persons busily employed in disposingof them.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Every afternoon the great bamboo lounging chairwas brought out and the interesting invalid conductedto it by stout Randa, who was head nurse, andfollowed by a train of shawl, cushion, foot-stool andbook bearers, who buzzed about like swarming beesround a new queen. When all were settled, the littlemaids sewed and the pages read aloud, with muchconversation by the way; for one of the rules was,that all should listen attentively, and if any one didnot understand what was read, he or she should askto have it explained on the spot. Whoever couldanswer was invited to do so, and at the end of thereading Miss Celia could ask any she liked, or addany explanations which seemed necessary. In thisway much pleasure and profit was extracted from thetales Ben and Thorny read, and much unexpectedknowledge as well as ignorance displayed, not tomention piles of neatly hemmed towels for which Baband Betty were paid like regular sewing-women.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　So vacation was not all play, and the girls foundtheir picnics, berry parties, and "goin' a visitin'," allthe more agreeable for the quiet hour spent with MissCelia. Thorny had improved wonderfully, and wasgetting to be quite energetic, especially since hissister's accident; for while she was laid up he wasthe head of the house, and much enjoyed his promotion.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　But Ben did not seem to flourish as he haddone at first. The loss of Sancho preyed upon himsadly, and the longing to go and find his dog grewinto such a strong temptation that he could hardlyresist it. He said little about it; but now, and then aword escaped him which might have enlightened anyone who chanced to be watching him. No one was,just then, so he brooded over this fancy, day by day,in silence and solitude, for there was no riding anddriving now. Thorny was busy with his sister tryingto show her that he remembered how good she hadbeen to him when he was ill, and the little girls hadtheir own affairs.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Miss Celia was the first to observe the change,having nothing to do but lie on the sofa and amuseherself by seeing others work or play. Ben wasbright enough at the readings, because theyn he forgothis troubles; but when they were over and his variousduties done, he went to his own room or soughtconsolation with Lita, being sober and quiet, andquite unlike the merr monkey all knew and liked sowell.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Thorny, what is the matter with Ben?" asked MissCelia, one day, when she and her brother were alonein the "green parlor," as they called the lilac-treewalk.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Fretting about Sanch, I suppose. I declare Iwish that dog had never been born! Losing him hasjust spoilt Ben. Not a bit of fun left in him, and hewon't have any thing I offer to cheer him up."Thorny spoke impatiently, and knit his brows overthe pressed flowers he was neatly gumming into hisherbal.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I wonder if he has any thing on his mind? Heacts as if he was hiding a trouble he didn't dareto tell. Have you talked with him about it?" askedMiss Celia, looking as if she was hiding a trouble shedid not like to tell.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Oh, yes, I poke him up now and then, but he getspeppery, so I let him alone. May be he is longingfor his old circus again. Shouldn't blame him muchif he was; it isn't very lively here, and he's used toexcitement, you know.""I hope it isn't that. Do you think he would slipaway without telling us, and go back to the old lifeagain?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Don't believe he would. Ben isn't a bit of asneak; that's why I like him.""Have you ever found him sly or untrue in anyway?" asked Miss Celia, lowering her voice.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No; he's as fair and square a fellow as I ever saw.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Little bit low, now and then, but he doesn't mean it,and wants to be a gentleman, only he never livedwith one before, and it's all new to him. I'll gethim polished up after a while.""Oh, Thorny, there are three peacocks on the place,and you are the finest! " laughed Miss Celia, as herbrother spoke in his most condescending way witha lift of the eyebrows very droll to see.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"And two donkeys, and Ben's the biggest, not toknow when he is well off and happy!" retorted the"gentleman," slapping a dried specimen on the pageas if he were pounding discontented Ben.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Come here and let me tell you something whichworries me. I would not breathe it to another soul,but I feel rather helpless, and I dare say you canmanage the matter better than I."Looking much mystified, Thorny went and sat onthe stool at his sister's feet, while she whisperedconfidentially in his ear: " I've lost some money outof my drawer, and I'm so afraid Ben took it.""But it's always locked up and you keep the keysof the drawer and the little room?""It is gone, nevertheless, and I've had my keyssafe all the time.""But why think it is he any more than Randa, orKaty, or me?""Because I trust you three as I do myself. I'veknown the girls for years, and you have no object intaking it since all I have is yours, dear.""And all mine is yours, of course. But, Celia, howcould he do it? He can't pick locks, I know, for wefussed over my desk together, and had to break itafter all.""I never really thought it possible till to-day whenyou were playing ball and it went in at the upperwindow, and Ben climbed up the porch after it;you remember you said, 'If it had gone in at thegarret gable you couldn't have done that so well; '
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　and he answered, 'Yes, I could, there isn't a spoutI can't shin up, or a bit of this roof I haven't beenover.'""So he did ; but there is no spout near the littleroom window.""There is a tree, and such an agile boy as Bencould swing in and out easily. Now, Thorny, I hateto think this of him, but it has happened twice, andfor his own sake I must stop it. If he is planning torun away, money is a good thing to have. And hemay feel that it is his own; for you know he askedme to put his wages in the bank, and I did. He maynot like to come to me for that, because he can giveno good reason for wanting it. I'm so troubled Ireally don't know what to do."She looked troubled, and Thorny put his armsabout her as if to keep all worries but his own awayfrom her.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Don't you fret, Cely, dear; you leave it to me.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　I'll fix him - ungrateful little scamp!""That is not the way to begin. I am afraid youwill make him angry and hurt his feelings, and thenwe can do nothing.""Bother his feelings! I shall just say, calmly andcoolly: 'Now, look here, Ben, hand over the moneyyou took out of my sister's drawer, and we'll let youoff easy,' or something like that.""It wouldn't do, Thorny; his temper would be upin a minute, and away he would go before we couldfind out whether he was guilty or not. I wish I knewhow to manage."Let me think," and Thorny leaned his chin on thearm of the chair, staring hard at the knocker asif he expected the lion's mouth to open with wordsof counsel then and there.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"By Jove, I do believe Ben took it!" he brokeout suddenly; "for when I went to his room thismorning to see why he didn't come and do myboots, he shut the drawer in his bureau as quick asa flash, and looked red and queer, for I didn't knock,and sort of startled him.""He wouldn't be likely to put stolen money there.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ben is too wise for that.""He wouldn't keep it there, but he might belooking at it and pitch it in when I called. He'shardly spoken to me since, and when I asked himwhat his flag was at half-mast for, he wouldn't answer.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Besides, you know in the reading this afternoon hedidn't listen, and when you asked what hewas thinking about, he colored up and mutteredsomething about Sanch. I tell you, Celia, it looksbad -- very bad," and Thorny shook his head with awise air.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It does, and yet we may be all wrong. Let uswait a little and give the poor boy a chance to clearhimself before we speak. I'd rather lose my moneythan suspect him falsely.""How much was it?""Eleven dollars; a one went first, and I supposedI'd miscalculated somewhere when I took some out;but when I missed a ten, I felt that I ought not to letit pass.""Look here, sister, you just put the case intomy hands and let me work it up. I won't say anything to Ben till you give the word; but I'll watchhim, and now that my eyes are open, it won't be easyto deceive me."Thorny was evidently pleased with the new playof detective, and intended to distinguish himself inthat line; but when Miss Celia asked how he meantto begin, he could only respond with a blankexpression: "Don't know! You give me the keys andleave a bill or two in the drawer, and may be I canfind him out somehow."So the keys were given, and the little dressing-room where the old secretary stood was closelywatched for a day or two. Ben cheered up a triflewhich looked as if he knew an eye was upon him,but otherwise he went on as usual, and Miss Celiafeeling a little guilty at even harboring a suspicionof him, was kind and patient with his moods.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Thorny was very funny in the unnecessary mysteryand fuss he made; his affectation of careless indifferenceto Ben's movements and his clumsy attempts towatch every one of them; his dodgings up and downstairs, ostentatious clanking of keys, and the elaboratetraps he set to catch his thief, such as throwing hisball in at the dressing-room window and sending Benup the tree to get it, which he did, thereby provingbeyond a doubt that he alone could have takenthe money, Thorny thought. Another deep discoverywas, that the old drawer was so shrunken that thelock could be pressed down by slipping a knife-bladebetween the hasp and socket.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Now it is as clear as day, and you'd better letme speak," he said, full of pride as well as regret atthis triumphant success of his first attempt as adetective.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Not yet, and you need do nothing more. I'mafraid it was a mistake of mine to let you do this;and if it has spoiled your friendship with Ben, I shallbe very sorry; for I do not think he is guilty,"answered Miss Celia.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Why not?" and Thorny looked annoyed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I've watched also, and he doesn't act like adeceitful boy. To-day I asked him if he wanted anymoney, or should I put what I owe him with the rest,and he looked me straight in the face with suchhonest, grateful eyes, I could not doubt him when hesaid 'Keep it, please, I don't need any thing here,you are all so good to me.'""Now, Celia, don't you be soft-hearted. He's asly little dog, and knows my eye is on him. WhenI asked him what he saw in the dressing-room, afterhe brought out the ball, and looked sharply at him,he laughed, and said 'Only a mouse,' as saucy asyou please.""Do set the trap there, I heard the mouse nibblinglast night, and it kept me awake. We must have acat or we shall be overrun.""Well, shall I give Ben a good blowing up, or willyou?" asked Thorny, scorning such poor prey asmice, and bound to prove that he was in the right.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I'll let you know what I have decided in themorning. Be kind to Ben, meantime, or I shall feelas if I had done you harm by letting you watch him."So it was left for that day, and by the next, MissCelia had made up her mind to speak to Ben. Shewas just going down to breakfast when the sound ofloud voices made her pause and listen. It came fromBen's room, where the two boys seemed to be disputingabout something.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I hope Thorny has kept his promise," shethought, and hurried through the back entry, fearinga general explosion.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ben's chamber was at the end, and she could seeand hear what was going on before she was nearenough to interfere. Ben stood against his closetdoor looking as fierce and red as a turkey-cock;Thorny sternly confronted him, saying in an excitedtone, and with a threatening gesture: "You arehiding something in there, and you can't deny it.""I don't.""Better not; I insist on seeing it.""Well, you won't.""What have you been stealing now?""Didn't steal it, -- used to be mine, -- I only tookit when I wanted it.""I know what that means. You'd better give itback or I'll make you.""Stop! " cried a third voice, as Thorny put outhis arm to clutch Ben, who looked ready to defendhimself to the last gasp, "Boys, I will settle thisaffair. Is there anything hidden in the closet, Ben?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　and Miss Celia came between the belligerent partieswith her one hand up to part them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Thorny fell back at once, looking half ashamed ofhis heat, and Ben briefly answered, with a gulp as ifshame or anger made it hard to speak steadily:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Yes 'm, there is.""Does it belong to you?""Yes 'm, it does.""Where did you get it?""Up to Squire's.""That's a lie!" muttered Thorny to himself.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ben's eye flashed, and his fist doubled up in spiteof him, but he restrained himself out of respect forMiss Celia, who looked puzzled, as she asked anotherquestion, not quite wure how to proceed with theinvestigation: "Is it money, Ben?""No 'm, it isn't.""Then what can it be?""Meow!" answered a fourth voice from the closet;and as Ben flung open the door a gray kitten walkedout, purring with satisfaction at her release.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Miss Celia fell into a chair and laughed till her eyeswere full; Thorny looked foolish, and Ben folded hisarms, curled up his nose, and regarded his accuserwith calm defiance, while pussy sat down to wash herface as if her morning toilette had been interruptedby her sudden abduction.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"That's all very well, but it doesn't mend mattersmuch, so you needn't laugh, Celia," began Thorny,recovering hiniself, and stubbornly bent on sifting thecase to the bottom, now he had begun.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Well, it would, if you'd let a feller alone. She saidshe wanted a cat, so I went and got the one they gaveme when I was at the Squire's. I went early and tookher without asking, and I had a right to," explainedBen, much aggrieved by having his surprise spoiled.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It was very kind of you, and I'm glad to havethis nice kitty. We will shut her up in my room tocatch the mice that plague me," said Miss Celia,picking up the little cat, and woindering how she wouldget her two angry boys safely down stairs.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"The dressing-room, she means; you know theway, and you don't need keys to get in," addedThorny, with such sarcastic emphasis that Ben feltsome insult was intended, and promptly resented it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　" You won't get me to climb any more trees afteryour balls, and my cat won't catch any of your mice,so you needn't ask me.""Cats don't catch thieves, and they are what I'mafter!""What do you mean by that?" fiercely demandedBen.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Celia has lost some money out of her drawer, andyou won't let me see what's in yours; So I thought,perhaps, you'd got it!" blurted out Thorny, findingit hard to say the words, angry as he was, for theface opposite did not look like a guilty one.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　For a minute, Ben did not seem to understand him,plainly as he spoke; then he turned an angry scarlet,and, with a reproachful glance at his mistress, openedthe little drawer so that both could see all that itcontained.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"They ain't any thing; but I'm fond of 'emthey are all I've got -- I was afraid he'd laugh at methat time, so I wouldn't let him look -- it was father'sbirthday, and I felt bad about him and Sanch -- "Ben's indignant voice got more and more indistinctas he stumbled on, and broke down over the lastwords. He did not cry, however. but threw back hislittle treasures as if half their sacredness was gone;and, making a strong effort at self-control, facedaround, asking of Miss Celia, with a grieved look,"Did you think I'd steal anything of yours?""I tried not to, Ben, but what could I do? It wasgone, and you the only stranger about the place.""Wasn't there any one to think bad of but me?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　he said, so sorrowfully that Miss Celia made up hermind on the spot that he was as innocent of the theftas the kitten now biting her buttons, no other refreshmentbeing offered.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Nobody, for I know my girls well. Yet, elevendollars are gone, and I cannot imagine where or howfor both drawer and door are always locked, becausemy papers and valuables are in that room.""What a lot! But how could I get it if it waslocked up?" and Ben looked as if that question wasunanswerable.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Folks that can climb in at windows for a ball, cango the same way for money, and get it easy enoughwhen they've only to pry open an old lock!"Thorny's look and tone seemed to make plain toBen all that they had been suspecting, and, beinginnocent, he was too perplexed and unhappy todefend himself. His eye went from one to the other,and, seeing doubt in both faces, his boyish heart sunkwithin him; for he could prove nothing, and his firstimpulse was to go away at once.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I can't say any thing, only that I didn't take themoney. You won't believe it, so I'd better go backwhere I come from. They weren't so kind, but theytrusted me, and knew I wouldn't steal a cent. Youmay keep my money, and the kitty, too; I don'twant 'em," and, snatching up his hat, Ben wouldgone straight away, if Thorny had not barred hispassage.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Come, now, don't be mad. Let's talk it over,and if I 'm wrong I'll take it all back and ask yourpardon," he said, in a friendly tone, rather scared atthe consequences of his first attempt, though as sureas ever that he was right.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It would break my heart to have you go in thatway, Ben. Stay at least till your innocence is proved,then no one can doubt what you say now.""Don't see how it can be proved," answered Ben,appeased by her evident desire to trust him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"We'll try as well as we know how, and the firstthing we will do is to give that old secretary a goodrummage from top to bottom. I've done it once,but it is just possible that the bills may have slippedout of sight. Come, now, I can't rest till I've doneall I can to comfort you and convince Thorny."Miss Celia rose as she spoke, and led the way to thedressing-room, which had no outlet except throughher chamber. Still holding his hat, Ben followed witha troubled face, and Thorny brought up the rear, doggedlydetermined to keep his eye on "the littlescamp" till the matter was satisfactorily cleared up.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Miss Celia had made her proposal more to soothe thefeelings of one boy and to employ the superfluousenergies of the other, than in the expectation ofthrowing any light upon the mystery; for she wassadly puzzled by Ben's manner, and much regrettedthat she had let her brother meddle in the matter.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"There," she said, unlocking the door with the keyThorny reluctantly gave up to her, "this is the roomand that is the drawer on the right. The lower oneshave seldom been opened since we came, and holdonly some of papa's old books. Those upper onesyou may turn out and investigate as much as you--Bless me! here 's something in your trap, Thornyand Miss Celia gave a little skip as she nearly trodon a long, gray tall, which hung out of the bole nowfilled by a plump mouse.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　But her brother was intent on more serious things,and merely pushed the trap aside as he pulled out thedrawer with an excited gesture, which sent it and allits contents clattering to the floor.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Confound the old thing! It always stuck so Ihad to give a jerk. Now, there it is, topsy-turvy,"and Thorny looked Much disgusted at his ownawkwardness.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No harm done; I left nothing of value in it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Look back there, Ben, and see if there is room for apaper to get worked over the top of the drawer. Ifelt quite a crack, but I don't believe it is possible f6rthings to slip out; the place was never full enough tooverflow in any way."Miss Celia spoke to Ben, who was kneeling downto pick up the scattered papers, among which weretwo marked dollar bills, -- Thorny's bait for the thief.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ben looked into the dusty recess, and then put in hishand, saying carelessly, -"There's nothing but a bit of red stuff.""My old pen-wiper -- Why, what's the matter?"asked Miss Celia, as Ben dropped the handful Of whatlooked like rubbish.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Something warm and wiggly inside of it," answered Ben,stooping to examine the contents ofthe little scarlet bundle. "Baby mice ! Ain't theyfunny? Look just like mites of young pigs. We'llhave to kill 'em if you've caught their mamma," hesaid, forgetting his own trials in boyish curiosity abouthis "find,"Miss Celia stooped also, and gently poked the redcradle with her finger; for the tiny mice werenestling deeper into the fluff with small squeals of alarm.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Suddenly she cried out: "Boys, boys, I've found thethief! Look here; pull out these bits and see ifthey won't make up my lost bills."Down went the motherless babies as four ruthlesshands pulled apart their cosey nest, and there,among the nibbled fragments, appeared enoughfinely printed, greenish paper, to piece out parts oftwo bank bills. A large cypher and part of a figureone were visible, and that accounted for the ten; butthough there were other bits, no figures could befound, and they were willing to take the other billon trust.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Now, then, am I a thief and a liar? " demandedBen, pointing proudly to the tell-tale letters spreadforth on the table, over which all three had beeneagerly bending.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div>
