When they playedhouse Bab was always the father, and went hunting orfishing with great energy and success, bringing homeall sorts of game, from elephants and crocodiles tohumming-birds and minnows. Betty was the mother, anda most notable little housewife, always mixing upimaginary delicacies with sand and dirt in old pansand broken china, which she baked in an oven of herown construction.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Both had worked hard that day, and were glad toretire to their favorite lounging-place, where Bab washappy trying to walk across the wide top bar withoutfalling off, and Betty enjoyed slow, luxurious swingswhile her sister was recovering from her tumbles. Onthis occasion, having indulged their respective tastes,they paused for a brief interval of conversation, sittingside by side on the gate like a pair of plump graychickens gone to roost.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Don't you hope Ben will get his bag full? Weshall have such fun eating nuts evenings observedBab, wrapping her arms in her apron, for it was Octobernow, and the air was growing keen.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Yes, and Ma says we may boil some in our littlekettles. Ben promised we should have half," answeredBetty, still intent on her cookery.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I shall save some of mine for Thorny.""I shall keep lots of mine for Miss Celia.""Doesn't it seem more than two weeks since shewent away?""I wonder what she'll bring us."Before Bab could conjecture, the sound of a stepand a familiar whistle made both look expectantlytoward the turn in the road, all ready to cry out inone voice, "How many have you got?" Neitherspoke a word, however, for the figure which presentlyappeared was not Ben, but a stranger, -- a manwho stopped whistling, and came slowly on dustinghis shoes in the way-side grass, and brushing thesleeves of his shabby velveteen coat as if anxious tofreshen himself up a bit.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It's a tramp, let's run away," whispered Betty,after a hasty look.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I ain't afraid," and Bab was about to assume herboldest look when a sneeze spoilt it, and made herclutch the gate to hold on.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　At that unexpected sound the man looked up,showing a thin, dark face, with a pair of sharp, blackeyes, which surveyed the little girls so steadily thatBetty quaked, and Bab began to wish she had atleast jumped down inside the gate.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"How are you?" said the man with a goodnaturednod and smile, as if to re-assure the round-eyedchildren staring at him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Pretty well, thank you, sir," responded Bab,politely nodding back at him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Folks at home? " asked the ,an, looking overtheir heads toward the house.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Only Ma; all the rest have gone to be married.""That sounds lively. At the other place all thefolks had gone to a funeral," and the man laughed ashe glanced at the big house on the hill.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Whh, do you know the Squire?" exclaimed Bab,much surprised and re-assured.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Come on purpose to see him. Just strollinground till he gets back," with an impatient sort ofsigh.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Betty thought you was a tramp, but I wasn'tafraid. I like tramps ever since Ben came,"explained Bab, with her usual candor.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Who 's Ben!" and the man came nearer soquickly that Betty nearly fell backward. "Don'tyou be scared, Sissy. I like little girls, so you seteasy and tell me about Ben," he added, in a persuasivetone, as he leaned on the gate so near that bothcould see what a friendly face he had in spite of itseager, anxious look.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Ben is Miss Celia's boy. We found him moststarved in the coach-house, and he's been here eversince," answered Bab, comprehensively.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Tell me about it. I like tramps, too," andthe man looked as if he did very much, as Bab toldthe little story in a few childish words that werebetter than a much more elegant account.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You were very good to the little feller," was allthe man said when she ended her somewhat confusedtale, in which she had jumbled the old coachand Miss Celia, dinner-pails and nutting, Sancho andcircuses.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"'Course we were! He's a nice boy and we arefond of him, and he likes us," said Bab, heartily.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　" 'Specially me," put in Betty, quite at ease now,for the black eyes had softened wonderfully, and thebrown face was smiling all over.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Don't wonder a mite. You are the nicest pairof little girls I've seen this long time," and the manput a hand on either side of them, as if he wanted tohug the chubby children. But he didn't do it; hemerely smiled and stood there asking questions tillthe two chatterboxes had told him every thing therewas to tell in the most confiding manner, for he verysoon ceased to seem like a stranger, and looked sofamiliar that Bab, growing inquisitive in her turn,suddenly said, --"Haven't you ever been here before? It seems asif I'd seen you.""Never in my life. Guess you've seen somebodythat looks like me," and the black eyes twinkled fora minute as they looked into the puzzled little facesbefore him, then he said, soberly, --"I'm looking round for a likely boy; don't youthink this Ben would suite me? I want just such alively sort of chap.""Are you a circus man?" asked Bab, quickly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Well, no, not now. I'm in better business.""I'm glad of it -- we don't approve of 'em; but Ido think they're splendid!"Bab began by gravely quoting Miss Celia, and endedwith an irrepressible burst of admiration whichcontrasted drolly with her first remark.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Betty added, anxiously: "We can't let Ben go anyway. I know he wouldn't want to, and Miss Celiawould feel bad. Please don't ask him.""He can do as he likes, I suppose. He hasn't gotany folks of his own, has he?""No, his father died in California, and Ben felt sobad he cried, and we were real sorry, and gave him apiece of Ma, 'cause he was so lonesome," answeredBetty, in her tender little voice, with a pleading lookwhich made the man stroke her smooth check andsay, quite softly, --"Bless your heart for that! I won't take himaway, child, or do a thing to trouble anybody that'sbeen good to him.""He 's coming now. I hear Sanch barking at thesquirrels!" cried Bab, standing up to get a goodlook down the road.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The man turned quickly, and Betty saw that hebreathed fast as he watched the spot where the lowsunshine lay warmly on the red maple at the corner.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Into this glow came unconscious Ben, whistling "RoryO'Moore," loud and Clear, as he trudged along with aheavy bag of nuts over his shoulder and the light fullon his contented face. Sancho trotted before andsaw the stranger first, for the sun in Ben's eyesdazzled him. Since his sad loss Sancho cherisheda strong dislike to tramps, and now he paused togrowl and show his teeth, evidently intending to warnthis one off the premises.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"He won't hurt you -- " began Bab, encouragingly;but before she could add a chiding word tothe dog, Sanch gave an excited howl, and flew at theman's throat as if about to throttle him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Betty screamed, and Bab was about to go to therescue when both perceived that the dog was lickingthe stranger's face in an ecstasy of joy, and heard theman say as he hugged the curly beast, --"Good old Sanch!" I knew he wouldn't forgetmaster, and he doesn't""What's the matter?" called Ben, coming upbriskly, with a strong grip of his stout stick.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　There was no need of any answer, for, as he cameinto the shadow, he saw the man, and stood lookingat him as if he were a ghost.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It's father, Benny; don't you know me?" asked theman, with an odd sort of choke in his voice, as he thrustthe dog away, and held out both hands to the boy.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Down dropped the nuts, and crying, "Oh, Daddy,Daddy!" Ben cast himself into the arms of the shabbyvelveteen coat, while poor Sanch tore round them indistracted circles, barking wildly, as if that was theonly way in which he could vent his rapture.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　What happened next Bab and Betty never stoppedto see, but, dropping from their roost, they wentflying home like startled Chicken Littles with theastounding news that "Ben's father has come alive,and Sancho knew him right away!"Mrs. Moss had just got her cleaning done up, andwas resting a minute before setting the table, but sheflew out of her old rocking-chair when the excitedchildren told the wonderful tale, exclaiming as theyended, --"Where is he? Go bring him here. I declare itfairly takes my breath away!"Before Bab could obey, or her mother composeherself, Sancho bounced in and spun round like aninsane top, trying to stand on his head, walk upright,waltz and bark all at once, for the good old fellowhad so lost his head that he forgot the loss of his tail.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"They are coming! they are coming! See, Ma,what a nice man he is," said Bab, hopping about onone foot as she watched the slowly approaching pair.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"My patience, don't they look alike! I shouldknow he was Ben's Pa anywhere!" said Mrs. Moss,running to the door in a hurry.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　They certainly did resemble one another, and it wasalmost comical to see the same curve in the legs, thesame wide-awake style of wearing the hat, the samesparkle of the eye, good-natured smile and agilemotion of every limb. Old Ben carried the bag inone hand while young Ben held the other fast, lookinga little shame-faced at his own emotion now, forthere were marks of tears on his cheeks, but too gladto repress the delight he felt that he had really foundDaddy this side heaven.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Mrs. Moss unconsciously made a pretty little pictureof herself as she stood at the door with her honestface shining and both hands ont, saying in a heartytone, which was a welcome in itself,"I'm real glad to see you safe and well, Mr.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Brown! Come right in and make yourself to home.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　I guess there isn't a happier boy living than Ben isto-night.""And I know there isn't a gratefuler man livingthan I am for your kindness to my poor forsaken littlefeller," answered Mr. Brown, dropping both his burdensto give the comely woman's hands a hard shake.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Now don't say a word about it, but sit down andrest, and we'll have tea in less'n no time. Ben mustbe tired and hungry, though he's so happy I don'tbelieve he knows it," laughed Mrs. Moss, bustlingaway to hide the tears in her eyes, anxious to makethings sociable and easy all round.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　With this end in view she set forth her best china,and covered the table with food enough for a dozen,thanking her stars that it was baking day, andevery thing had turned out well. Ben and his father sattalking by the window till they were bidden to "drawup and help themselves" with such hospitable warmththat every thing had an extra relish to the hungrypair.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ben paused occasionally to stroke the rusty coat-sleeve with bread-and-buttery fingers to convincehimself that "Daddy" had really come, and his fatherdisposed of various inconvenient emotions by eating asif food was unknown in California. Mrs. Moss beamedon every one from behind the big tea-pot like a mildfull moon, while Bab and Betty kept interrupting oneanother in their eagerness to tell something new aboutBen and how Sanch lost his tail.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Now you let Mr. Brown talk a little; we all wantto hear how he 'came alive,' as you call it," said Mrs.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Moss, as they drew round the fire in the "settin'-room,"leaving the tea-things to take care of themselves.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　It was not a long story, but a very interesting oneto this circle of listeners; all about the wild life on theplains trading for mustangs, the terrible kick from avicious horse that nearly killed Ben, sen., the longmonths of unconsciousness in the California hospital,the slow recovery, the journey back, Mr. Smithers'stale of the boy's disappearance, and then the anxioustrip to find out from Squire Allen where he now was.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I asked the hospital folks to write and tell you assoon as I knew whether I was on my head or myheels, and they promised; but they didn't; so I cameoff the minute I could, and worked my way back,expecting to find you at the old place. I was afraidyou'd have worn out your welcome here and goneoff again, for you are as fond of travelling as yourfather.""I wanted to sometimes, but the folks here wereso dreadful good to me I couldn't," confessed Ben,secretly surprised to find that the prospect of going offwith Daddy even cost him a pang of regret, for theboy had taken root in the friendly soil, and was nolonger a wandering thistle-down, tossed about byevery wind that blew.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I know what I owe 'em, and you and I will workout that debt before we die, or our name isn't B.B.,"said Mr. Brown, with an emphatic slap on his knee,which Ben imitated half unconsciously as he exclaimedheartily, --"That's so!" adding, more quietly, "What areyou going to do now? Go back to Smithers and theold business?""Not likely, after the way he treated you, Sonny.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　I've had it Out with him, and he won't want to seeme again in a hurry," answered Mr. Brown, with asudden kindling of the eye that reminded Bab of Ben'sface when he shook her after losing Sancho.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"There's more circuses than his in the world; butI'll have to limber out ever so much before I'm goodfor much in that line," said the boy, stretching hisstout arms and legs with a curious mixture of satisfactionand regret.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You've been living in clover and got fat, yourascal," and his father gave him a poke here and there,as Mr. Squeers did the plump Wackford, when displayinghim as a specimen of the fine diet at Do-the-boys Hall.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Don't believe I could put you up nowif I tried, for I haven't got my strength back yet, andwe are both out of practice. It's just as well, for I'veabout made up my mind to quit the business andsettle down somewhere for a spell, if I can get anything to do," continued the rider, folding his arms andgazing thoughtfully into the fire.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I shouldn't wonder a mite if you could right here,for Mr. Towne has a great boarding-stable overyonder, and he's always wanting men." Said Mrs.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Moss, eagerly, for she dreaded to have Ben go, andno one could forbid it if his father chose to takehim away.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"That sounds likely. Thanky, ma'am. I'll lookup the concern and try my chance. Would you callit too great a come-down to have father an 'ostlerafter being first rider in the 'Great Golden Menagerie,Circus, and Colossem,' hey, Ben? " asked Mr. Brown,quoting the well-remembered show-bill with a laugh.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No, I shouldn't; it's real jolly up there whenthe big barn is full and eighty horses have to betaken care of. I love to go and see 'em. Mr. Towneasked me to come and be stable-boy when I rode thekicking gray the rest were afraid of. I hankeredto go, but Miss Celia had just got my new books, andI knew she'd feel bad if I gave up going to school.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Now I'm glad I didn't, for I get on first rate andlike it.""You done right, boy, and I'm pleased with you.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Don't you ever be ungrateful to them that befriendedyou, if you want to prosper. I'll tackle the stablebusiness a Monday and see what's to be done. NowI ought to be walking, but I'll be round in the morningma'am, if you can spare Ben for a spell to-morrow.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　We'd like to have a good Sunday tramp and talk;wouldn't we, Sonny?" and Mr. Brown rose to go withhis hand on Ben's shoulder, as if loth to leave himeven for the night.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Mrs. Moss saw the longing in his face, and forgettingthat he was an utter stranger, spoke right out ofher hospitable heart.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It's a long piece to the tavern, and my little backbedroom is always ready. It won't make a mite oftrouble if you don't mind a plain place, and you areheartily welcome."Mr. Brown looked pleased, but hesitated to acceptany further favor from the good soul who had alreadydone so much for him and his. Ben gave him notime to speak, however, for running to a door heflung it open and beckoned, saying, eagerly, --"Do stay, father; it will be so nice to have you.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　This is a tip-top room; I slept here the night I came,and that bed was just splendid after bare ground for afortnight.""I'll stop, and as I'm pretty well done up, I guesswe may as well turn in now," answered the new guest;then, as if the memory of that homeless little lad sokindly cherished made his heart overflow in spite ofhim, Mr. Brown paused at the door to say hastily,with a hand on Bab and Betty's heads, as if hispromise was a very earnest one, --"I don't forget, ma'am, these children shall neverwant a friend while Ben Brown's alive; " then he shutthe door so quickly that the other Ben's prompt"Hear, hear!" was cut short in the middle.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I s'pose he means that we shall have a piece ofBen's father, because we gave Ben a piece of ourmother," said Betty, softly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Of course he does, and it's all fair," answeredBab, decidedly. "Isn't he a nice man, Ma?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Go to bed, children," was all the answer she got;but when they were gone, Mrs. Moss, as she washedup her dishes, more than once glanced at a certainnail where a man's hat had not hung for five years,and thought with a sigh what a natural, protecting airthat slouched felt had.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　If one wedding were not quite enough for a child'sstory, we might here hint what no one dreamed ofthen, that before the year came round again Benhad found a mother, Bab and Betty a father, and Mr.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Brown's hat was quite at home behind the kitchendoor. But, on the whole, it is best not to say a wordabout it.
