Miss Celia advertised,Thorny offered rewards, and even surly Pat kept asharp look-out for poodle dogs when he went tomarket; but no Sancho or any trace of him appeared.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ben was inconsolable, and sternly said itserved Bab right when the dogwood poison affectedboth face and hands. Poor Bab thought so, too,and dared ask no sympathy from him, though Thornyeagerly prescribed plantain leaves, and Betty kept hersupplied with an endless succession of them steepedin cream and pitying tears. This treatment was sosuccessful that the patient soon took her place insociety as well as ever, but for Ben's affliction there wasno cure, and the boy really suffered in his spirits.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I don't think it's fair that I should have so muchtrouble, -- first losing father and then Sanch. If itwasn't for Lita and Miss Celia, I don't believe I couldstand it," he said, one day, in a fit of despair, about aweek after the sad event.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Oh, come now, don't give up so, old fellow. We'llfind him if he s alive, and if he isn't I'll try and getyou another as good," answered Thorny, with afriendly slap on the shoulder, as Ben sat disconsolatelyamong the beans he had been hoeing.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"As if there ever could be another half as good!"cried Ben, indignant at the idea; "or as if I'd evertry to fill his place with the best and biggest dog thatever wagged a tail! No, sir, there's only one Sanchin all the world, and if I can't have him I'll neverhave a dog again.""Try some other sort of pet, then. You may haveany of mine you like. Have the peacocks; do now,"urged Thorny, full of boyish sympathy and good-will.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"They are dreadful pretty, but I don't seem to careabout em, thank you," replied the mourner.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Have the rabbits, all of them," which was a handsomeoffer on Thorny's part, for there were a dozenat least.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"They don't love a fellow as a dog does; all theycare for is stuff to eat and dirt to burrow in. I'msick of rabbits." And well he might be, for he hadhad the charge of them ever since they came, andany boy who has ever kept bunnies knows what acare they are.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"So am I! Guess we'll have an auction and sellout. Would Jack be a comfort to you? If he will,you may have him. I'm so well now, I can walk,or ride anything," added Thorny, in a burst ofgenerosity.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Jack couldn't be with me always, as Sanch was,and I couldn't keep him if I had him."Ben tried to be grateful, but nothing short of Litawould have healed his wounded heart, and she wasnot Thorny's to give, or he would probably haveoffered her to his afflicted friend.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Well, no, you couldn't take Jack to bed with you,or keep him up in your room, and I'm afraid heWould never learn to do any thing clever. I do wishI had something you wanted, I'd so love to give it toyou."He spoke so heartily and was so kind that Ben lookedup, feeling that he had given him one of the sweetestthings in the world -- friendship; he wanted to tell himso, but did not know how to do it, so caught up his hoeand fell to work, saying, in a tone Thorny understoodbetter than words, --"You are real good to me -never mind, I won'tworry about it; only it seems extra hard coming so soonafter the other--"He stopped there, and a bright drop fell on the beanleaves, to shine like dew till Ben saw clearly enough tobury it out of sight in a great flurry.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"By Jove! I'll find that dog, if he is out of theground. Keep your spirits up, my lad, and we'll havethe dear old fellow back yet."With which cheering prophecy Thorny went off torack his brains as to what could be done about thematter.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Half an hour afterward, the sound of a hand-organ inthe avenue roused him from the brown study into whichhe had fallen as he lay on the newly mown grass of thelawn. Peeping over the wall, Thorny reconnoitred,and, finding the organ a good one, the man a pleasant-faced Italian, and the monkey a lively animal, heordered them all in, as a delicate attention to Ben,for music and monkey together might suggest soothingmemories of the past, and so be a comfort.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　In they came by way of the Lodge, escorted by Baband Betty, full of glee, for hand-organs were rare inthose parts, and the children delighted in them. Smilingtill his white teeth shone and his black eyessparkled, the man played away while the monkeymade his pathetic little bows, and picked up the penniesThorny threw him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It is warm, and you look tired. Sit down and I'llget you Some dinner," said the young master, pointingto the seat which now stood near the great gate.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　With thanks in broken English the man gladlyobeyed, and Ben begged to be allowed to make Jackoequally comfortable, explaining that he knew all aboutmonkeys and what they liked. So the poor thing wasfreed from his cocked hat and uniform, fed with breadand milk, and allowed to curl himself up in the coolgrass for a nap, looking so like a tired littie old manin a fur coat that the children were never weary ofwatching him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Meantime, Miss Celia had come out, and was talkingItalian to Giacomo in a way that delighted hishomesick heart. She had been to Naples, and couldunderstand his longing for the lovely city of his birth,so they had a little chat in the language which is allMusic, andd the good fellow was so grattful that heplayed for the children to dance till they were glad tostop, lingering afterward as if he hated to set out againupon his lonely, dusty walk.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I'd rather like to tramp round with him for a weekor so. Could make enough to live on as easy as not,if I only I had sanch to show off," said Ben, as he wascoaxing Jacko into the suit which he detested.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You go wid me, yes?" asked the man, nodding andsmiling, well pleased at the prospect of company, forhis quick eye and what the boys let fall in their talkshowed him that Ben was not one of them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　If I had my dog I'd love to," and with sad eagernessBen told the tale of his loss, for the thought of itwas never long out of his mind.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I tink I see droll dog like he, way off in New York.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　He do leetle trick wid letter, and dance, and go on hehead, and many tings to make laugh," said the man,when he had listened to a list of Sanch's beauties andaccomplishments.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Who had him? " asked Thorny, full of interest atonce.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"A man I not know. Cross fellow what beat himwhen he do letters bad.""Did he spell his name?" cried Ben, breathlessly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No; that for why man beat him. He name Generale,and he go spell Sancho all times, and cry whenwhip fall on him. Ha! yes! that name true one; notGenerale? " and the man nodded, waved his hands,and showed his teeth, almost as much excited as theboys.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It's Sanch! let's go and get him now, right off!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　cried Ben, in a fever to be gone.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"A hundred miles away, and no clue but this man'sstory? We must wait a little, Ben, and be sure beforewe set out," said Miss Celia, ready to do almost anything, but not so certain as the boys. " What sort ofa dog was it? A large, curly, white poodle, with aqueer tail ?" she asked of Giacomo.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No, Signorina mia, he no curly, no wite; he black,smooth dog, littel tail, small, so;" and the man heldup one brown finger with a gesture which suggested ashort, wagging tail.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"There, you see how mistaken we were. Dogs areoften named Sancho, especially Spanish poodles; forthe original Sancho was a Spaniard, you know. Thisdog is not ours, and I'm so sorry."The boys' faces had fallen dismally as their hope wasdestroyed; but Ben would not give up. For him therewas and could be only one Sancho in the world, andhis quick wits suggested an explanation which no oneelse thought of.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It may be my dog, -- they color 'em as we used topaint over trick horses. I told you he was a valuablechap, and those that stole him hide him that way, elsehe'd be no use, don't you see? because we'd knowhim.""But the black dog had no tail," began Thorny,longing to be convinced, but still doubtful.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ben shivered as if the mere thought hurt him, as hesaid, in a grim tone, --"They might have cut Sanch's off.""Oh, no! no! they mustn't, -- they wouldn't!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　How Could any one be so wicked?" cried Bab andBetty, horrified at the suggestion.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You don't know what such fellows would do tomake all safe, so they could use a dog to earn theirliving for 'em," said Ben, with mysterious significance,quite forgetting in his wrath that be had just proposedto get his own living in that way himself.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"He no your dog? Sorry I not find him for you.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Addio, signorina! Grazia, signor! Buon giorno, buongiorno!" and, kissing his hand, the Italian shoulderedorgan and monkey, ready to go.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Miss Celia detained him long enough to give himher address, and beg him to let her know if he metpoot Sanch in any of his wanderings; for such itinerantshowmen often cross each other's paths. Ben andThorny walked to the school-corner with him, gettingmore exact information about the black dog and hisowner, for they had no intention of giving it up sosoon.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　That very evening, Thorny wrote to a boy cousinin New York, giving all the particulars of the case,and begging him to hunt up the man, investigate thedog, and see that the police made sure that every thingwas right. Much relieved by this performance, theboys waited anxiously for a reply, and when it camefound little comfort in it. Cousin Horace had donehis duty like a man, but regretted that he could onlyreport a failure. The owner of the black poodle wasa suspicious character, but told a straight story, howhe had bought the dog from a stranger, and exhibitedhim with success till he was stolen. Knew nothing ofhis history, and was very sorry to lose him, for hewas a remarkably clever beast.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I told my dog-man to look about for him, but hesays he has probably been killed, with ever so manymore; so there is an end of it, and I call it a meanshame.""Good for Horace! I told you he'd do it upthoroughly and see the end of it," said Thorny, ashe read that paragraph in the deeply interesting letter.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"May be the end of that dog, but not of mine.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　I'll bet he ran away; and if it was Sanch, he'll comehome. You see if he doesn't!" cried Ben, refusingto believe that all was over.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"A hundred wiles off? Oh, he couldn't find youwithout help, smart as he is," answered Thorny,incredulously.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ben looked discouraged, but Miss Celia cheeredhim up again by saying, --"Yes, he could. My father had a friend who lefta little dog in Paris; and the creature found her inMilan, and died of fatigue next day. That was verywonderful, but true; and I've no doubt that if Sanchis alive he will come home. Let us hope so, and behappy, while we wait.""We will!" said the boys; and day after daylooked for the wanderer's return, kept a bone readyin the old place if he should arrive at night, andshook his mat to keep it soft for his weary boneswhen he came. But weeks passed, and still noSanch.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Something else happened, however, so absorbingthat he was almost forgotten for a time; and Benfound a way to repay a part of all he owed his bestfriend.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Miss Celia went off for a ride one afternoon, and anhour afterward, as Ben sat in the porch reading, Litadashed into the yard with the reins dangling abouther legs, the saddle turned round, and one side coveredwith black mud, showing that she had beendown. For a minute, Ben's heart stood still; thenhe flung away his book, ran to the horse, and saw atonce by her heaving flanks, dilated nostrils, and wetcoat, that she must have come a long way and at fullspeed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"She has had a fall, but isn't hurt or frightened,"thought the boy, as the pretty creature rubbed her noseagainst his shoulder, pawed the ground, and champedher bit, as if she tried to tell him all about thedisaster, whatever it was.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Lita, where's Miss Celia?" he asked, lookingstraight into the intelligent eyes, which were troubledbut not wild.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Lita threw up her head, and neighed loud andclear, as if she called her mistress; and, turning, wouldhave gone again if Ben had not caught the reins andheld her.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"All right, we'll find her;" and, pulling off thebroken saddle, kicking away his shoes, and ramminghis hat firmly on, Ben was up like a flash, tingling allover with a sense of power as he felt the bare backbetween his knees, and caught the roll of Lita's eyeas she looked round with an air of satisfaction.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Hi, there! Mrs. Moss! Something has happenedto Miss Celia, and I'm going to find her. Thornyis asleep; tell him easy, and I'll come back as soonas I can!"Then, giving Lita her head, he was off before thestartled woman had time to do more than wring herhands and cry out, --"Go for the Squire! Oh, what shall we do?"As if she knew exactly what was wanted of her,Lita went back the way she had come, as Ben couldsee by the fresh, irregular tracks that cut up the roadwhere she had galloped for help. For a mile ormore they went, then she paused at a pair of bars,which were let down to allow the carts to pass into thewide hay-fields beyond. On she went again, canteringacross the new-mown turf toward a brook, acrosswhich she had evidently taken a leap before; for, onthe further side, at a place where cattle went to drink,the mud showed signs of a fall.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You were a fool to try there; but where is MissCelia?" said Ben, who talked to animals as if theywere people, and was understood much better thanany one not used to their companionship would imagine.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Now Lita seemed at a loss, and put her head down,as if she expected to find her mistress where she hadleft her, somewhere on the ground. Ben called, butthere was no answer; and he rode slowly along thebrook-side, looking far and wide with anxiouseyes.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"May be she wasn't hurt, and has gone to thathouse to wait," thought the boy, pausing for a lastsurvey of the great, sunny field, which had no placeof shelter in it but one rock on the other side of thelittle stream. As his eye wandered over it, somethingdark seemed to blow out from behind it, as if thewind played in the folds of a shirt, or a human limbmoved. Away went Lita, and in a moment Ben hadfound Miss Celia, lying in the shadow of the rock,so white and motionless, he feared that she was dead.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　He leaped down, touched her, spoke to her; and,receiving no answer, rushed away to bring a littlewater in his leaky hat to sprinkle in her face, as hehad seen them do when any of the riders got a fallin the circus, or fainted from exhaustion after theyleft the ring, where "do or die" was the motto alladopted.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　In a minute, the blue eyes opened, and she recognizedthe anxious face bending over her, sayingfaintly, as she touched it, --"My good little Ben, I knew you'd find me, -- Isent Lita for you, -- I'm so hurt, I couldn't come.""Oh,where? What shall I do? Had I better runup to the house?" asked Ben, overjoyed to hearher speak, but much dismayed by her seeminghelplessness, for he had seen bad falls, and had them,too.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I feel bruised all over, and my arm is broken, I'mafraid. Lita tried not to hurt me. She slipped, andwe went down. I came here into the shade, and thepain made me faint, I suppose. Call somebody, andget me home."Then she shut her eyes, and looked so whitethat Ben hurried away, and burst upon old Mrs.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Paine, placidly knitting at the end door, so suddenlythat, as she afterward said, "It sca't her like a clap o'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　thunder.""Ain't a man nowheres around. All down in thebig medder gettin' in hay," was her reply to Ben'sbreathless demand for "everybody to come and seeto Miss Celia."He turned to mount, for he had flung himself offbefore Lita stopped, but the old lady caught his jacket,and asked half a dozen questions in a breath.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Who's your folks? What's broke? How'd shefall? Where is she? Why didn't she come righthere? Is it a sunstroke?"As fast as words could tumble out of his mouth,Ben answered, and then tried to free himself; but theold lady held on, while she gave her directions,expressed her sympathy, and offered her hospitalitywith incoherent warmth.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Sakes alive! poor dear! Fetch her right in.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Liddy, get out the camphire; and, Melissy, you hauldown a bed to lay her on. Falls is dretful uncert'inthings; shouldn't wonder if her back was broke.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Father's down yender, and he and Bijah will seeto her. You go call 'em, and I'll blow the horn tostart 'em up. Tell her we'd be pleased to see her,and it won't make a mite of trouble."Ben heard no more, fur as Mrs. Paine turned to takedown the tin horn he was up and away.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Several long and dismal toots sent Lita gallopingthrough the grassy path as the sound of the trumpetexcites a war-horse, and "father and Bijah," alarmedby the signal at that hour, leaned on their rakes tosurvey with wonder the distracted-looking little horsemanapproaching like a whirlwind.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Guess likely grandpa's had 'nother stroke. Told'em to send over soon 's ever it come," said thefarmer, calmly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Shouldn't wonder ef suthing was afire some'r's,"conjectured the hired man, surveying the horizon fora cloud of smoke.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Instead of advancing to meet the messenger, bothstood like statues in blue overalls and red flannel shirts,till the boy arrived and told his tale.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Sho, that's bad," said the farmer, anxiously.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"That brook always was the darndest place," addedBijah; then both men bestirred themselves helpfully,the former hurrying to Miss Cella while the latterbrought up the cart and made a bed of hay to layher on.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Now then, boy, you go for the doctor. Myw omenfolks will see to the lady, and she'd better keep quietup yender till we see what the matter is," said thefarmer, when the pale girl was lifted in as carefully asfour strong arms could do it. "Hold on," he added,as Ben made one leap to Lita's back. You'll haveto go to Berryville. Dr. Mills is a master hand forbroken bones and old Dr. Babcock ain't. 'Tisn't butabout three miles from here to his house, and you'llfetch him 'fore there's any harm done waitin'.""Don't kill Lita," called Miss Celia from the cart, asit began to move.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　But Ben did not hear her, for he was off across thefields, riding as if life and death depended upon hisspeed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"That boy will break his neck," said Mr. Paine,standing still to watch horse and rider go over thewall as if bent on instant destruction.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No fear for Ben, he can ride any thing, and Litawas trained to leap," answered Miss Celia, falling backon the hay with a groan, for she had involuntarilyraised her head to see her little squire dash away ingallant style.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I should hope so; regular jockey, that boy.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Never see any thing like it out of a race-ground,"and Farmer Paine strode on, still following with hiseye the figures that went thundering over the bridge,up the hill, out of sight, leaving a cloud of cloudof dust behind.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Now that his mistress was safe, Ben enjoyed thatwild ride mightily, and so did the bay mare; for Litahad good blood in her, and proved it that day bydoing her three miles in a wonderfully short time.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　People jogging along in wagons and country carry-allsstared amazed as the reckless pair went by. Women,placidly doing their afternoon sewing at the front windows,dropped their needles to run out with exclamationsof alarm, sure some one was being run away with;children playing by the roadside scattered likechickens before a hawk, as Ben passed with a warningwhoop, and baby-carriages were scrambled intodoor-yards with perilous rapidity at his approach.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　But when he clattered into town, intense interestwas felt in this barefooted boy on the foaming steed,and a dozen voices asked, "Who's killed?" as hepulled up at the doctor's gate.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;

 　　"Jest drove off that way; Mrs. Flynn's baby's in afit," cried a stout lady from the piazza, never ceasingto rock, though several passers-by paused to hear thenews, for she was a doctor's wife, and used to theanival of excited messengers from all quarters at allhours of the day and night.

 　　Deigning no reply to any one, Ben rode away, wishinghe could leap a yawning gulf, scale a precipice, orford a raging torrent, to prove his devotion to MissCelia, and his skill in horsemanship. But no dangersbeset his path, and he found the doctor pausing towater his tired horse at the very trough where Baband Sancho had been discovered on that ever-memorableday. The story was quickly told, and, promisingto be there as soon as possible, Dr. Mills drove on torelieve baby Flynn's inner man, a little disturbed by abit of soap and several buttons, upon which he hadprivately lunched while his mamma was busy at thewash-tub.

 　　Ben thanked his stars, as he had already done morethan once, that he knew how to take care of a horse;for he delayed by the watering-place long enough towash out Lita's mouth with a handful of wet grass,to let her have one swallow to clear her dusty throat,and then went slowly back over the breezy hills, pattingand praising the good creature for her intelligenceand speed. She knew well enough that she had beena clever little mare, and tossed her head, arched herglossy neck, and ambled daintily along, as consciousand coquettish as a pretty woman, looking round ather admiring rider to return his compliments by glanceof affection, and caressing sniffs of a velvet nose at hisbare feet.

 　　Miss Celia had been laid comfortably in bed by thefarmer's wife and daughter; and, when the doctorarrived, bore the setting of her arm bravely. Noother serious damage appeared, and bruises soonheal, so Ben was sent home to comfort Thorny witha good report, and ask the Squire to drive up in hisbig carry-all for her the next day, if she was able tobe moved.

 　　Mrs. Moss had been wise enough to say nothing,but quietly made what preparations she could, andwaited for tidings. Bab and Betty were away berrying,so no one had alarmed Thorny, and he had hisafternoon nap in peace, -- an unusually long one,owing to the stillness which prevailed in the absenceof the children; and when he awoke he lay readingfor a while before he began to wonder where everyone was. Lounging out to see, he found Ben andLita reposing side by side on the fresh straw in theloose box, which had been made for her in the coach-house. By the pails, sponges and curry-combs lyingabout, it was evident that she had been refreshed bya careful washing and rubbing down, and my ladywas now luxuriously resting after her labors, withher devoted groom half asleep close by.

 　　"Well, of all queer boys you are the queerest, tospend this hot afternoon fussing over Lita, just forthe fun of it!" cried Thorny, looking in at them withmuch amusement.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"If you knew what we'd been doing, you'd think Iought to fuss over her, and both of us had a right torest! " answered Ben, rousing up as bright as a button;for he longed to tell his thrilling tale, and hadwith difficulty been restrained from bursting in onThorny as soon as he arrived.

 　　He made short work of the story, but was quitesatisfied with the sensation it produced; for hislistener was startled, relieved, excited and charmed,in such rapid succession, that he was obliged to situpon the meal-chest and get his breath before heCould exclaim, with an emphatic demonstration ofhis heels against the bin,--"Ben Brown, I'll never forget what you've donefor Celia this day, or say 'bow-legs' again as long asI live"George! I felt as if I had six legs when wewere going the pace. We were all one piece, andhad a jolly spin, didn't we, my beauty?" and Benchuckled as he took Lita's head in his lap, whileshe answered with a gusty sigh that nearly blew himaway.

 　　Like the fellow that brought the good news fromGhent to Aix," said Thorny, surveying the recumbentpair with great admiration.

<div>
 　　"What follow?" asked Ben, wondering if he didn'tmean Sheridan, of whose ride he had heard.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Don't you know that piece? I spoke it at school.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Give it to you now; see if it isn't a rouser."And, glad to find a vent from his excitement, Thornymounted the meal-chest, to thunder out that stirringballad with such spirit that Lita pricked up her earsand Ben gave a shrill "Hooray!" as the last verseended.

 　　"And all I remember is friends flocking round,As I sat with his head 'twixt my knees on the ground,And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine,As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine,Which (the burgesses voted by common consent)Was no more than his due who brought good news fromGhent."
