A sort of peace-offering,you know; for he feels dreadfully hurt aboutour suspecting him," said Thorny, at dinner that day.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I see he does, though he tries to seem as brightand pleasant as ever. I do not wonder, and I've beenthinking what I could do to soothe his feelings. Canyou suggest any thing? ""Cuff-buttons. I saw some jolly ones over at Berryville,oxidized silver, with dogs' heads on them,yellow eyes, and all as natural as could be. Those,now, would just suit him for his go-to-meeting whiteshirts, -- neat, appropriate, and in memoriam."Miss Celia could not help laughing, it was such aboyish suggestion; but she agreed to it, thinkingThorny knew best, and hoping the yellow-eyed dogswould be as balm to Ben's wounds.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Well, dear, you may give those, and Lita shallgive the little whip with a horse's foot for a handle, ifit is not gone. I saw it at the harness shop in town;and Ben admired it so much that I planned to give itto him on his birthday.""That will tickle him immensely; and if you'djust let him put brown tops to my old boots, and sticka cockade in his hat when he sits up behind the phae-ton, he'd be a happy fellow," laughed Thorny, whohad discovered that one of Ben's ambitions was to bea tip-top groom.""No, thank you; those things are out of place inAmerica, and would be absurd in a small countryplace like this. His blue suit and straw hat pleaseme better for a boy; though a nicer little groom, inlivery or out, no one could desire, and you may tellhim I said so.""I will, and he'll look as proud as punch; for hethinks every word you say worth a dozen from any oneelse. But won't you give him something? Just somelittle trifle, to show that we are both eating humblepie, feeling sorry about the mouse money.""I shall give him a set of school-books, and try toget him ready to begin when vacation is over. Aneducation is the best present we can make him; andI want you to help me fit him to enter as well is hecan. Bab and Betty began, little dears, -- lent himtheir books and taught all they knew; so Ben got ataste, and, with the right encouragement, would liketo go on, I am sure.""That's so like you Celia! Always thinking ofthe best thing and doing it handsomely. I'll helplike a house a-fire, if he will let me; but, all day, he'sbeen as stiff as a poker, so I don't believe he forgivesme a bit.""He will in time, and if you are kind and patient,he will be glad to have you help him. I shall makeit a sort of favor to me on his part, to let you see tohis lessons, now and then. It will be quite true, forI don't want you to touch your Latin or algebra tillcool weather; teaching him will be play to you."Miss Celia's last words made her brother unbendhis brows, for he longed to get at his books again,and the idea of being tutor to his "man-servant" didnot altogether suit him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I'll tool him along at a great pace, if he will onlygo. Geography and arithmetic shall be my share,and you may have the writing and spelling; it givesme the fidgets to set copies', and hear children makea mess of words. Shall I get the books when I buythe other things? Can I go this afternoon?""Yes, here is the list; Bab gave it to me. You cango if you will come home early and have your toothfilled."Gloom fell at once upon Thorny's beaming face, andhe gave such a shrill whistle that his sister jumped inher chair, as she added, persuasively, --"It won't hurt a bit, now, and the longer youleave it the worse it will be. Dr. Mann is ready atany time; and, once over, you will be at peace formonths. Come, my hero, give your orders, and takeone of the girls to support you in the trying hour.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Have Bab; she will enjoy it, and amuse you withher chatter.""As if I needed girls round for such a trifle asthat!" returned Thorny with a shrug, though hegroaned inwardly at the prospect before him, as mostof us do on such occasions. "I wouldn't take Babat any price; she'd only get into some scrape, andupset the whole plan. Betty is the chicken for me, --a real little lady, and as nice and purry as a kitten.""Very well; ask her mother, and take good careof her. Let her tuck her dolly in, and she will becontented anywhere. There's a fine air, and theawning is on the phaeton, so you won't feel the sun.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Start about three, and drive carefully."Betty was charmed to go, for Thorny was a sort ofprince in her eyes; and to be invited to such a grandexpedition was an overwhelming honor. Bab was notsurprised, for, since Sancho's loss, she had felt herselfin disgrace, and been unusually meek; Ben let her"severely alone," which much afflicted her, for he washer great admiration, and had been pleased to expresshis approbation of her agility and courage so often,that she was ready to attempt any fool-hardy feat torecover his regard. But vainly did she risk her neckjumping off the highest beams in the barn, trying tokeep her balance standing on the donkey's back, andleaping the lodge gate at a bound; Ben vouchsafedno reward by a look, a smile, a word of commendation;and Bab felt that nothing but Sancho's returnwould ever restore the broken friendship.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Into faithful Betty's bosom did she pour forth herremorseful lamentations, often bursting out with thepassionate exclamation, "If I could only find Sanch,and give him back to Ben, I wouldn't care if Itumbled down and broke all my legs right away!"Such abandonment of woe made a deep impressionon Betty; and she fell into the way of consoling hersister by cheerful prophecies, and a firm belief thatthe organ-man would yet appear with the lost darling.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I've got five cents of my berry money, and I'llbuy you an orange if I see any," promised Bettystepping to kiss Bab, as the phaeton came to thedoor, and Thorny handed in a young lady whosewhite frock was so stiff with starch that it crackledlike paper.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Lemons will do if oranges are gone. I like 'emto suck with lots of sugar," answered Bab, feelingthat the sour sadly predominated in her cup justnow.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Don't she look sweet, the dear!" murmured Mrs.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Moss, proudly surveying her youngest.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　She certainly did, sitting under the fringed canopywith "Belinda," all in her best, upon her lap, as sheturned to smile and nod, with a face so bright andwinsome under the little blue hat, that it was no wondermother and sister thought there never was such aperfect child as "our Betty."Dr. Mann was busy when they arrived, but wouldbe ready in an hour; so they did their shopping atonce, having made sure of the whip as they camealong. Thorny added some candy to Bab's lemon,and Belinda had a cake, which her mamma obliginglyate for her. Betty thought that Aladdin's palacecould not have been more splendid than the jeweller'sshop where the canine cuff-buttons were bought;but when they came to the book-store, she forgotgold, silver, and precious stones, to revel in picture-books, while Thorny selected Ben's modest schooloutfit. Seeing her delight, and feeling particularlylavish with plenty of money in his pocket, the younggentleman completed the child's bliss by telling herto choose whichever one she liked best out of thepile of Walter Crane's toy-books lying in bewilderingcolors before her.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"This one; Bab always wanted to see the dreadfulcupboard, and there's a picture of it here," answeredBetty, clasping a gorgeous copy of "Bluebeard" tothe little bosom, which still heaved with the raptureof looking at that delicious mixture of lovely Fatimasin pale azure gowns, pink Sister Annes on the turrettop, crimson tyrants, and yellow brothers with forestsof plumage blowing wildly from their mushroom-shaped caps.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Very good; there you are, then. Now, comeon, for the fun is over and the grind begins," saidThorny, marching away to his doom, with his tonguein his tooth, and trepidation in his manly breast.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Shall I shut my eyes and hold your head?"quavered devoted Betty, as they went up the stairsso many reluctant feet had mounted before them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Nonsense, child, never mind me! You look outof window and amuse yourself; we shall not be long,I guess;" and in went Thorn silently hoping thatthe dentist had been suddenly called away, or someperson with an excruciating toothache would be waitingto take ether, and so give our young man anexcuse for postponing his job.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　But no; Dr. Mann was quite at leisure, and, full ofsmiling interest, awaited his victim, laying forth hisunpleasant little tools with the exasperating alacrityof his kind. Glad to be released from any share inthe operation, Betty retired to the back window tobe as far away as possible, and for half in hour wasso absorbed in her book that poor Thorny mighthave groaned dismally without disturbing her.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Done now, directly, only a trifle of polishing offand a look round," said Dr. Mann, at lat; andThorny, with a yawn that nearly rent him asunder,called out, --"Thank goodness! Pack up, Bettykin.""I'm all ready!" and, shutting her book with astart, she slipped down from the easy chair in a greathurry.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　But "looking round" took time; and, before thecircuit of Thorny's mouth was satisfactorily made,Betty had become absorbed by a more interestingtale than even the immortal "Bluebeard." A noiseof children's voices in the narrow alley-way behindthe house attracted her attention; the long windowopened directly on the yard, and the gate swung inthe wind. Curious as Fatima, Betty went to look;but all she saw was a group of excited boys peepingbetween the bars of another gate further down.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"What's the matter?" she asked of two smallgirls, who stood close by her, longing but not daringto approach the scene of action.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Boys chasing a great black cat, I believe,"answered one child.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Want to come and see?" added the other,politely extending the invitation to the stranger.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The thought of a cat in trouble would have nervedBetty to face a dozen boys; so she followed at once,meeting several lads hurrying away on some importanterrand, to judge from their anxious countenances.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Hold tight, Jimmy, and let 'em peek, if they wantto. He can't hurt anybody now," said one of thedusty huntsmen, who sat on the wide coping of thewall, while two others held the gate, as if a cat couldonly escape that way.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You peek first, Susy, and see if it looks nice,"said one little girl, boosting her friend so that shecould look through the bars in the upper part of thegate.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No; it 's only an ugly old dog!" respondedSusy, losing all interest at once, and descending witha bounce.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"He's mad! and Jud's gone to get his gun, so wecan shoot him!" called out one mischievous boy,resenting the contempt expressed for their capture.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Ain't, neither!" howled another lad from hisperch. "Mad dogs won't drink; and this one islapping out of a tub of water.""Well, he may be, and we don't know him, and hehasn't got any muzzle on, and the police will kill him ifJud don't," answered the sanguinary youth who hadfirst started the chase after the poor animal, whichhad come limping into town, so evidently a lostdog that no one felt any hesitation in stoning him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"We must go right home; my mother is dreadful'fraid of mad dogs, and so is yours," said Susy;and, having satisfted their curiosity, the young ladiesprudently retired.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　But Betty had not had her "peep," and could notresist one look; for she had heard of these unhappyanimals, and thought Bab would like to know howthey looked. So she stood on tip-toe and got a goodview of a dusty, brownish dog, lying on the grassclose by, with his tongue hanging out while hepanted, as if exhausted by fatigue and fear, for hestill cast apprehensive glances at the wall whichdivided him from his tormentors.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　His eyes are just like Sanch's," said Betty toherself, unconscious that she spoke aloud, till she sawthe creature prick up his cars and half rise, as if hehad been called.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"He looks as if he knew me, but it isn't ourSancho; he was a lovely dog." Betty said that tothe little boy peeping in beside her; but before hecould make any reply, the brown beast stood straightup with an inquiring bark, while his eyes shone liketopaz, and the short tail wagged excitedly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Why, that's just the way Sanch used to do!"cried Betty, bewildered by the familiar ways of thisunfamiliar-looking dog.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　As if the repetition of his name settled his owndoubts, he leaped toward the gate and thrust a pinknose between the bars, with a howl of recognition asBetty's face was more clearly seen. The boys tumbledprecipitately from their perches, and the littlegirl fell back alarmed, yet could not bear to runaway and leave those imploring eyes pleading to herthrough the bars so eloquently.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"He acts just like our dog, but I don't see how itcan be him. Sancho, Sancho, is it really you?" calledBetty, at her wits' end what to do.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Bow, wow, wow!" answered the well-known bark,and the little tail did all it could to emphasize thesound, while the eyes were so full of dumb love andjoy, the child could not refuse to believe that this uglystray was their own Sancho strangely transformed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　All of a sudden, the thought rushed into her mind,how glad Ben would be! -- and Bab would feel allhappy again. I must carry him home."Never stopping to think of danger, and forgettingall her doubts, Betty caught the gate handle out ofJimmy's grasp, exclaiming eagerly: "He is our dog!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Let me go in; I ain't afraid.""Not till Jud comes back; he told us we mustn't,"answered the astonished Jimmy, thinking the littlegirl as mad as the dog.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　With a confused idea that the unknown Jud hadgone for a gun to shoot Sanch, Betty gave a desperatepull at the latch and ran into the yard, bent on savingher friend. That it was a friend there could heno further question; for, though the cleature rushedat her as if about to devour her at a mouthful, it wasonly to roll ecstatically at her feet, lick her hands, andgaze into her face, trying to pant out the welcomewhich he could not utter. An older and more prudentperson would have waited to make sure beforeventuring in; but confiding Betty knew little of thedanger which she might have run; her heart spokemore quickly than her head, and, not stopping to havethe truth proved, she took the brown dog on trust,and found it was indeed dear Sanch.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Sitting on the grass, she hugged him close, carelessof tumbled hat, dusty paws on her clean frock, or arow of strange boys staring from the wall.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Darling doggy, where have you been so long?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　she cried, the great thing sprawling across her lap, asif he could not get near enough to his brave littleprotector. "Did they make you black and beat you,dear? Oh, Sanch, where is your tail -- your prettytail?"A plaintive growl and a pathetic wag was all theanswer he could make to these tender inquiries; fornever would the story of his wrongs be known, andnever could the glory of his do-gsh beauty be restored.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Betty was trying to comfort him with patsand praises, when a new face appeaerd; at the gate,and Thorny's authoritative voice called out, --"Betty Moss, what on earth are you doing in therewith that dirty beast?""It's Sanch, it's Sanch! Oh, come and see!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　shrieked Betty, flying up to lead forth her prize.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　But the gate was held fast, for some one said thewords, "Mad dog," and Thorny was very naturallyalarmed, because he had already seen one. "Don'tstay there another minute. Get up on that benchand I'll pull you over," directed Thorny, mountingthe wall to rescue his charge in hot haste; for thedog did certainly behave queerly, limping hurriedlyto and fro, as if anxious to escape. No wonder,when Sancho heard a voice he knew, and recognizedanother face, yet did not meet as kind a welcome asbefore.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No, I'm not coming out till he does. It is Sanch,and I'm going to take him home to Ben," answeredBetty, decidedly, as she wet her handkerchief in therain water to bind up the swollen paw that hadtravelled many miles to rest in her little hand again.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You're crazy, child. That is no more Ben's dogthan I am.""See if it isn't!" cried Betty, perfectly unshakenin her faith; and, recalling the words of command aswell as she could, she tried to put Sancho through hislittle performance, as the surest proof that she wasright. The poor fellow did his best, weary and foot-sorethough he was; but when it came to taking histail in his mouth to waltz, he gave it up, and, droppingdown, hid his face in his paws, as he always did whenany of his tricks failed. The act was almost patheticnow, for one of the paws was bandaged, and hiswhole attitude expressed the humiliation of a brokenspirit.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　That touched Thorny, and, quite convinced bothof the dog's sanity and identity, he sprung downfrom the wall with Ben's own whistle, which gladdenedSancho's longing ear as much as the boy's roughcaresses comforted his homesick heart.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Now, let's carry him right home, and surpriseBen. Won't he be pleased?" said Betty, so inearnest that she tried to lift the big brute inspite of his protesting yelps.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You are a little trump to find him out in spite ofall the horrid things that have been done to him. Wemust have a rope to lead him, for he's got no collarand no muzzle. He has got friends though, and I'dlike to see any one touch him now. Out of the way,there, boy!" Looking as commanding as a drum-major,Thorny cleared a passage, and with one armabout his neck, Betty proudly led her treasuremagnanimously ignoring his late foes, and keepinghis eye fixed on the faithful friend whose tender littleheart had known him in spite of all disguises.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I found him, sir," and the lad who had been mosteager for the shooting, stepped fowward to claim anyreward that might be offered for the now valuablevictim.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I kept him safe till she came," added the jailerJimmy, speaking for himself.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I said he wasn't mad", cried a third, feeling thathis discrimination deserved approval.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Jud ain't my brother," said the fourth, eager toclear his skirts from all ofi-ence.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"But all of you chased and stoned him, I suppose?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　You'd better look out or you'll get reported to theSociety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals."With this awful and mysterious threat, Thornyslammed the doctor's gate in the faces of the mercenaryyouths, nipping their hopes in the bud, and teachingthem a good lesson.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　After one astonished stare, Lita accepted Sanchowithout demur, and they greeted one another cordially,nose to nose, instead of shaking hands. Thenthe dog nestled into his old place under the linenduster with a grunt of intense content, and soon fellfast asleep, quite worn out with fatigue.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　No Roman conqueror bearing untold treasureswith him, ever approached the Eternal City feelingricher or prouder than did Miss Betty as she rolledrapidly toward the little brown house with the captivewon by her own arms. Poor Belinda was forgotten in acorner, "Bluebeard" was thrust under thecushion, and the lovely lemon was squeezed beforeits time by being sat upon; for all the child couldthink of was Ben's delight, Bab's remorseful burdenlifted off, "Ma's" surprise, and Miss Celia's pleasure.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　She could hardly realize the happy fact, and keptpeeping under the cover to be sure that the deardingy bunch at her feet was truly there.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I'll tell you how we'll do it," said Thorny, breakinga long silence as Betty composed herself with anirrepressible wriggle of delight after one of theserefreshing peeps. "We'll keep Sanch hidden, andsmuggle him into Ben's old room at your house.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Then I'll drive on to the barn, and not say a word,but send Ben to get something out of that room.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　You just let him in, to see what he'll do. I'll betyou a dollar he won't know his own dog.""I don't believe I can keep from screaming rightout when I see him, but I'll try. Oh, won't it befun!" -- and Betty clapped her hands in joyfulanticipation of that exciting moment.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　A nice little plan, but Master Thorny forgot thekeen senses of the amiable animal snoring peacefullyamong his boots; and, when they stopped at theLodge, he had barely time to say in a whisper,"Ben's coming; cover Sanch and let me get him inquick!" before the dog was out of the phaeton likea bombshell, and the approaching boy went down asif shot, for Sancho gave one leap, and the two rolledover and over, with a shout and a bark of rapturousrecognition.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Who is hurt?" asked Mrs. Moss, running outwith floury hands uplifted in alarm.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Is it a bear?" cried Bab, rushing after her,beater in hand, for a dancing bear was the delight ofher heart.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Sancho's found! Sancho's found!" shoutedThorny, throwing up his hat like a lunatic.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Found, found, found!" echoed Betty, dancingwildly about as if she too had lost her little wits.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Where? how? when? who did it?" asked Mrs.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Moss, clapping her dusty hands delightedly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It isn't; it's an old dirty brown thing," stammeredBab, as the dog came uppermost for a minute, andthen rooted into Ben's jacket as if hesmelt a woodchuck, and was bound to have him outdirectly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div>

 　　Then Thorny, with many interruptions from Betty,poured forth the wondrous tale, to which Bab and hismother listened breathlessly, while the muffins burnedas black as a coal, and nobody cared a bit.

 　　"My precious lamb, how did you dare to do sucha thing?" exclaimed Mrs. Moss, hugging the smallheroine with mingled admiration and alarm.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I'd have dared, and slapped those horrid boys,too. I wish I'd gone!" and Bab felt that she hadfor ever lost the chance of distinguishing herself.

 　　"Who cut his tail off?" demanded Ben, in a menacingtone, as he came uppermost in his turn, dusty,red and breathless, but radiant.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"The wretch who stole him, I suppose; and he de-serves to be hung," answered Thorny, hotly.
</div>

 　　"If ever I catch him, I'll -- I'll cut his nose off,"roared Ben, with such a vengeful glare that Sanchbarked fiercely; and it was well that the unknown"wretch" was not there, for it would have gonehardly with him, since even gentle Betty frowned,while Bab brandished the egg-beater menacingly,and their mother indignantly declared that "it wastoo bad!"Relieved by this general outburst, they composedtheir outraged feelings; and while the returnedwanderer went from one to another to receive a tenderwelcome from each, the story of his recovery wasmore calmly told. Ben listened with his eye devouringthe injured dog; and when Thorny paused, heturned to the little heroine, saying solemnly, ashe laid her hand with his own on Sancho's head,"Betty Moss, I'll never forget what you did; fromthis minute half of Sanch is your truly own, and if Idie you shall have the whole of him," and Ben sealedthe precious gift with a sounding kiss on either chubbycheck.

 　　Betty was so deeply touched by this noble bequest,that the blue eyes filled and vwuld have overflowedif Sanch had not politely offered his tongue like ared pocket-handkerchlef, and so made her laugh thedrops away, while Bab set the rest off by sayinggloomily, --"I mean to play with all the mad dogs I can find;then folks will think I'm smart and give me nicethings.""Poor old Bab, I'll foigive you now, and lend youmy half whenever you want it," said Ben, feeling atpeace now with all mankind, including, giris who tagged.

 　　"Come and show him to Celia," begged Thorny,eager to fight his battles over again.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Better wash him up first; he's a sight to see,poor thing," suggested Mrs. Moss, as she ran in,suddenly remembering her muffins.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It will take a lot of washings to get that brownstuff off. See, his pretty, pink skin is all stained withit. We'll bleach him out, and his curls will grow, andhe'll be as good as ever -- all but -- "Ben could not finish, and a general wail went up forthe departed tassel that would never wave proudly inthe breeze again.

 　　"I'll buy him a new one. Now form the proccessionand let us go in style," said Thorny, cheerily, ashe swung Betty to his shoulder and marched awaywhistling "Hail! the conquering hero comes," whileBen and his Bow-wow followed arm-in-arm, and Babbrought up the rear, banging on a milk-pan with theegg-beater.
