But I can't bear to see these poor fellows;"and Ben brooded over the fine etching of the dead and dyinghorses on a battle-field, one past all further pain, the otherhelpless, but lifting his head from his dead master toneigh a farewell to the comrades who go galloping away in acloud of dust.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"They ought to stop for him, some of 'em," muttered Ben,hastily turning back to the cheerful picture of the threehappy horses in the field, standing knee-deep among thegrass as they prepare to drink at the wide stream.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Ain't that black one a beauty? Seems as if I couldsee his mane blow in the wind, and hear him whinnyto that small feller trotting down to see if he can'tget over and be sociable. How I'd like to take arousin' run round that meadow on the whole lot of'em!" and Ben swayed about in his chair as if he wasalready doing it in imagination.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You may take a turn round my field on Lita anyday. She would like it, and Thorny's saddle will behere next week," said Miss Celia, pleased to see thatthe boy appreciated the fine pictures, and felt suchhearty sympathy with the noble animals whom shedearly loved herself.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Needn't wait for that. I'd rather ride bareback.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Oh, I say, is this the book you told about, wherethe horses talked?" asked Ben, suddenly recollectingthe speech he had puzzled over ever since he heard it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No; I brought the book, but in the hurry of mytea-party forgot to unpack it. I'll hunt it up to-night. Remind me, Thorny.""There, now, I've forgotten something, too! Squiresent you a letter; and I'm having such a jolly time, Inever thought of it."Ben rummaged out the note with remorseful haste,protesting that he was in no hurry for Mr. Gulliver,and very glad to save him for another day.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Leaving the young folks busy with their games,Miss Celia sat in the porch to read her letters, forthere were two; and as she read her face grew sosober, then so sad, that if any one had been lookinghe would have wondered what bad news had chasedaway the sunshine so suddenly. No one did look;no one saw how pitifully her eyes rested on Ben'shappy face when the letters were put away, and noone minded the new gentleness in her manner as shecame back, to the table. But Ben thought there neverwas so sweet a lady as the one who leaned over himto show him how the dissected map went togetherand never smiled at his mistakes.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　So kind, so very kind was she to them all, thatwhen, after an hour of merry play, she took herbrother in to bed, the three who remained fell topraising her enthusiastically as they put things torights before taking leave.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"She's like the good fairies in the books, and hasall sorts of nice, pretty things in her house," saidBetty, enjoying a last hug of the fascinating dollwhose lids would shut so that it was a pleasure toSing, "Bye, sweet baby, bye," with no staring eyes toSpoil the illusion.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"What heaps she knows! More than Teacher, I dobelieve; and she doesn't mind how many questionswe ask. I like folks that will tell me things," addedBab, whose inquisitive mind was always hungry.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I like that boy first-rate, and I guess he likes me,though I didn't know where Nantucket ought to go.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　He wants me to teach him to ride when he's on hispins again, and Miss Celia says I may. She knowshow to make folks feel good, don't she?" and Bengratefully surveyed the Arab chief, now his own,though the best of all the collection.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Won't we have splendid times? She Says wemay come over every night and play with her andThorny.""And she's goin', to have the seats in the porchlift up, so we can put our things in there all day andhave 'em handy.""And I'm going to be her boy, and stay here allthe time. I guess the letter I brought was arecommend from the Squire.""Yes, Ben; and if I had not already made up mymind to keep you before, I certainly would now, myboy."Something in Miss Celia's voice, as she said the lasttwo words with her hand on Ben's shoulder, made himlook up quickly and turn red with pleasure, wonderingwhat the Squire had written about him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Mother must have some of the party; so youshall take her these, Bab, and Betty may carry Babyhome for the night. She is so nicely asleep, it is apity to wake her. Good by till to-morrow, littleneighbors," continued Miss Celia, and dismissed thegirls with a kiss.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Is Ben coming, too?" asked Bab, as Bettytrotted off in a silent rapture with the big darlingbobbing over her shoulder.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Not yet; I've several things to settle with mynew man. Tell mother he will come by-and-by."Off rushed Bab with the plateful of goodies; and,drawing Ben down beside her on the wide step, MissCelia took out the letters, with a shadow creepingover her face as softly as the twilight was stealingover the world, while the dew fell, and every thinggrew still and dim.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Ben, dear, I've something to tell you," she began,slowly; and the boy waited with a happy face, for noone had called him so since 'Melia died.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"The Squire has heard about your father, and thisis the letter Mr. Smithers sends.""Hooray! where is he, please?" cried Ben, wishingshe would hurry up; for Miss Celia did not even offerhim the letter, but sat looking down at Sancho on thelower step, as if she wanted him to come and help her.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"He went after the mustangs, and sent some home,but could not come himself.""Went further on, I s'pose. Yes, he said he mightgo as far as California, and if he did he'd send for me.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　I'd like to go there; it's a real splendid place, theysay.""He has gone further away than that, to a loveliercountry than California, I hope." And Miss Celia'seyes turned to the deep sky, where early stars wereshining.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Didn't he send for me? Where's he gone?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　When 's he coming back?" asked Ben, quickly; forthere was a quiver in her voice, the meaning of whichhe felt before he understood.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Miss Celia put her arms about him, and answeredvery tenderly, --"Ben, dear, if I were to tell you that he was nevercoming back, could you bear it?""I guess I could, -- but you don't mean it? Oh,ma'am, he isn't dead?" cried Ben, with a cry thatmade her heart ache, and Sancho leap up with abark.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"My poor little boy, I wish I could say no."There was no need of any more words, no needof tears or kind arms around him. He knew he wasan orphan now, and turned instinctively to the oldfriend who loved him best. Throwing himself downbeside his dog, Ben clung about the curly neck,sobbing bitterly, --"Oh, Sanch, he's never coming back again; never,never any more!"Poor Sancho could only whine and lick away thetears that wet the half-hidden face, questioning thenew friend meantime with eyes so full of dumb loveand sympathy and sorrow that they seemed almosthuman. Wiping away her own tears, Miss Celiastooped to pat the white head, and to stroke theblack one lying so near it that the dog's breast wasthe boy's pillow. Presently the sobbing ceased, andBen whispered, without looking up,--"Tell me all about it; I'll be good."Then, as kindly as she could, Miss Celia read thebrief letter which told the hard news bluntly; forMr. Smithers was obliged to confess that he hadknown the truth months before, and never told theboy, lest he should be unfitted for the work theygave him. Of Ben Brown the elder's death therewas little to tell, except that he was killed in somewild place at the West, and a stranger wrote the factto the only person whose name was found in Ben'spocket-book. Mr. Smithers offered to take the boyback and "do well by him," averring that the fatherwished his son to remain where he left him, andfollow the profession to which he was trained.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Will you go, Ben?" asked Miss Celia, hoping todistract his mind from his grief by speaking of otherthings.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No, no; I'd rather tramp and starve. He'sawful hard to me and Sanch; and he'd be worse,now father's gone. Don't send me back! Let mestay here; folks are good to me; there's nowhereelse to go." And the head Ben had lifted up with adesperate sort of look, went down again on Sancho'sbreast as if there were no other refuge left.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You shall stay here, and no one shall take youaway against your will. I called you 'my boy' inplay, now you shall be my boy in earnest; this shallbe your home, and Thorny your brother. We areorphans, too; and we will stand by one another till astronger friend comes to help us," said Miss Celia,with such a mixture of resolution and tenderness inher voice, that Ben felt comforted at once, andthanked her by laying his cheek against the prettyslipper that rested on the step beside him, as if hehad no words in which to swear loyalty to the gentlemistress whom be meant henceforth to serve withgrateful fidelity.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Sancho felt that he must follow suit; and gravelyput his paw upon her knee, with a low whine, as ifhe said, "Count me in, and let me help to pay mymaster's debt if I can."Miss Celia shook the offered paw cordially, andthe good creature crouched at her feet like a smalllion, bound to guard her and her house for evermore.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Don't lie on that cold stone, Ben; come hereand let me try to comfort you," she said, stoopingto wipe away the great drops that kept rolling downthe brown cheek half hidden in her dress.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　But Ben put his arm over his face, and sobbed outwith a fresh burst of grief, --"You can't, you didn't know him! Oh, daddy!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　daddy! if I'd only seen you jest once more!"No one could grant that wish; but Miss Celia didcomfort him, for presently the sound of music floatedout from the parlor, -- music so soft, so sweet, thatinvoluntarily the boy stopped his crying to listen;then quieter tears dropped slowly, seeming to soothehis pain as they fell, while the sense of lonelinesspassed away, and it grew possible to wait till it wastime to go to father in that far-off country lovelierthan golden California.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　How long she played Miss Celia never minded;but, when she stole out to see if Ben had gone, shefound that other friends, even kinder than herself,had taken the boy into their gentle keeping. Thewind had sung a lullaby among the rustling lilacs,the moon's mild face looked through the leafy archto kiss the heavy eyelids, and faithful Sancho stillkept guard beside his little master, who, with hishead pillowed on his arm, lay fast asleep, dreaming,happily, that Daddy had come home again.
