Among the boys and girlswho went trooping up to the "East Cornerknowledge-box," as they called it, was our friend Ben,with a pile of neat books under his arm. He feltvery strange, and decidedly shy; but put on a boldface, and let nobody guess that, though nearly thirteen,he had never been to school before. Miss Celiahad told his story to Teacher, and she, being a kindlittle woman, with young brothers of her own, madethings as easy for him as she could. In reading andwriting he did very well, and proudly took his placeamong lads of his own age; but when it came toarithmetic and geography, he had to go down a longway, and begin almost at the beginning, in spite ofThorny's efforts to "tool him along fast." It mortifiedhim sadly, but there was no help for it; and insome of the classes he had dear little Betty to consolewith him when he failed, and smile contentedlywhen he got above her, as he soon began to do, --for she was not a quick child, and plodded throughFirst Parts long after sister Bab was flourishing awayamong girls much older than herself.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Fortunately, Ben was a short boy and a clever one,so he did not look out of place among the ten andeleven year olders, and fell upon his lessons with thesame resolution with which he used to take a newleap, or practise patiently till he could touch his heelswith his head. That sort of exercise had given hima strong, elastic little body; this kind was to trainhis mind, and make its faculties as useful, quick andsure, as the obedient muscles, nerves and eye, whichkept him safe where others would have broken theirnecks. He knew this, and found much consolationin the fact that, though mental arithmetic was ahopeless task, he could turn a dozen somersaults, andcome up as steady as a judge. When the boyslaughed at him for saying that China was in Africa,he routed them entirely by his superior knowledgeof the animals belonging to that wild country; andwhen "First class in reading" was called, he marchedup with the proud consciousness that the shortestboy in it did better than tall Moses Towne or fat SamKitteridge.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Teacher praised him all she honestly could, andcorrected his many blunders so quietly that he soonceased to be a deep, distressful red during recitation,and tugged away so manfully that no one couldhelp respecting him for his efforts, and trying tomake light of his failures. So the fiist hard weekwent by, and though the boy's heart had sunk manya time at the prospect of a protracted wrestle withhis own ignorance, he made up his mind to win, andwent at it again on the Monday with fresh zeal, allthe better and braver for a good, cheery talk withMiss Celia in the Sunday evening twilight.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　He did not tell her one of his greatest trials,however, because he thought she could not help himthere. Some of the children rather looked downupon him, called him "tramp" and "beggar," twittedhim with having been a circus boy, and lived in atent like a gypsy. They did not mean to be cruel,but did it for the sake of teasing, never stopping tothink how much such sport can make a fellow-creaturesuffer. Being a plucky fellow, Ben pretended notto mind; but he did feel it keenly, because he wantedto start afresh, and be like other boys. He was notashamed of the old life; but, finding those aroundhim disapproved of it, he was glad to let it be forgotten,even by himself; for his latest recollections werenot happy ones, and present comforts made pasthardships seem harder than before.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　He said nothing of this to Miss Celia; but shefound it out, and liked him all the better for keepingsome of his small worries to hiniself. Bab and Bettycame over Monday afternoon full of indignationat some boyish insult Sam had put upon Ben; and,finding them too full of it to enjoy the reading, MissCelia asked what the matter was. Then both littlegirls burst out in a rapid succession of brokenexclamations, which did not give a very clear idea ofthe difficulty, --"Sam didn't like it because Ben jumped fartherthan he did -- ""And he said Ben ought to be in the poor-house.""And Ben said he ought to be in it pigpen.""So he had! -- such a greedy thing, bringing lovelybig apples, and not giving any one a single bite!""Then he was mad, and we all laughed; and hesaid, 'Want to fight?'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"And Ben said, 'No, thanky, not much fun inpounding a feather-bed.'""Oh, he was awfully mad then, and chased Ben upthe big maple.""He's there now, for Sam won't let him comedown till he takes it all back.""Ben won't; and I do believe he'll have to stayup all night," said Betty, distressfully.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"He won't care, and we'll have fun firing up hissupper. Nut cakes and cheese will go splendidly;and may be baked pears wouldn't get smashed, he'ssuch a good catch," added Bab, decidedly relishingthe prospect.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"If he does not come by tea-time, we will go andlook after him. It seems to me I have heard surne-thing about Sam's troubling him before, haven't I?"asked Miss Celia, ready to defend her protege againstall unfair persecution.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Yes,'m, Sam and Mose are always plaguing Ben.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　They are big boys, and we can't make them stop. Iwon't let the girls do it, and the little boys don't dareto, since Teacher spoke to them." answered Bab.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Why does not Teacher speak to the big ones?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Ben won't tell of them, or let us. He says he'llfight his own battles, and hates tell-tales. I guesshe won't like to have us tell you, but I don't care, forit is too bad!" and Betty looked ready to cry overher friend's tribulations.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I'm glad you did, for I will attend to it, and stopthis sort of thing," said Miss Celia, after the childrenhad told some of the tormenting speeches which hadtried poor Ben.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Just then Thorny appeared, looking much amused.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　and the little girls both called out in a breath, "Didyou see Ben and get him down?""He got himself down in the neatest way you canimagine;" and Thorny laughed at the recollection.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Where is Sam? " asked Bab.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Staring up at the sky to see where Ben has flownto.""Oh, tell about it!" begged Betty.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Well, I came along and found Ben treed, and Samstoning him. I stopped that at once, and told the'fat boy' to be off. He said he wouldn't till Benbegged his pardon; and Ben said he wouldn't do it,if he stayed up for a week. I was just preparingto give that rascal a scientific thrashing, when a loadof hay came along, and Ben dropped on to it so quietlythat Sam, who was trying to bully me, never saw himgo. It tickled me so, I told Sam I guessed I'd lethim off that time, and walked away, leaving him tohunt for Ben, and wonder where the dickens hehad vanished to."The idea of Sam's bewilderment amused the othersas much as Thorny, and they all had a good laughover it before Miss Celia asked, --"Where has Ben gone now?"" Oh, he'll take a little ride, and then slip downand race home full of the fun of it. But I've gotto settle Sam. I won't have our Ben hectored by anyone -- ""But yourself," put in his sister, with a sly smile,for Thorny was rather domineering at times.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"He doesn't mind my poking him up now andthen, it's good for him; and I always take his partagainst other people. Sam is a bully, and so isMose; and I'll thrash them both if they don'tstop."Anxious to curb her brother's pugnacious propensities,Miss Celia proposed milder measures, promisingto speak to the boys herself if there was any moretrouble.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I have been thinking that we should have somesort of merry-making for Ben on his birthday. Myplan was a very simple one; but I will enlarge it, andhave all the young folks come, and Ben shall be kingof the fun. he needs encouragement in well-doing,for he does try; and now the first hard part is nearlyover, I am sure he will get on bravely. If we treathim with respect, and show our regard for him, otherswill follow our example; and that will be better thanfighting about it.""So it will! What shall we do to make our partytip-top?" asked Thorny, falling into the trap at once;for he dearly loved to get up theatricals, and had nothad any for a long time.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"We will plan something splendid, a 'grand combination,'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　as you used to call your droll mixturesof tragedy, comedy, melodrama and farce," answeredhis sister, with her head already full of lively plots.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"We'll startle the natives. I don't believe theyever saw a play in all their lives, hey, Bab?""I've seen a circus.""We dress up and do ' Babes in the Wood,"' addedBetty, with dignity.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Pho! that's nothing. I'll show you acting thatwill make your hair stand on end, and you shallact too. Bab will be capital for the naughty girls,"began Thorny, excited by the prospect of producinga sensation on the boards, and always ready totease the girls.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Before Betty could protest that she did not wanther hair to stand up, or Bab could indignantly declinethe rele offered her, a shrill whistle was heard, andMiss Celia whispered, with a warning look, --"Hush! Ben is coming, and he must not know anything about this yet."The next day was Wednesday, and in the afternoonMiss Celia went to hear the children "speak pieces,"though it was very seldom that any of the busymatrons and elder sisters found time or inclination forthese displays of youthful oratory. Miss Celia andMrs. Moss were all the audience on this occasion, butTeacher was both pleased and proud to see them,and a general rustle went through the school as theycame in, all the girls turning from the visitors to nodat Bab and Betty, who smiled all over their roundfaces to see "Ma" sitting up "'side of Teacher,"and the boys grinned at Ben, whose heart beganto beat fast at the thought of his dear mistress comingso far to hear him say his piece.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Thorny had recommended Marco Bozzaris, butBen preferred John Gilpin, and ran the famous racewith much spirit, making excellent time in some partsand having to be spurred a little in others, but came outall right, though quite breathless at the end, sittingdown amid great applause, some of which, curiouslyenough, seemed to come from outside; which in factit did, for Thorny was bound to hear but would notcome in, lest his presence should abash one orator atleast.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Other pieces followed, all more or less patriotic andwarlike, among the boys; sentimental among thegirls. Sam broke down in his attempt to give oneof Webster's great speeches, Little Cy Fay boldlyattacked"Again to the battle, Achaians!"and shrieked his way through it in a shrill, smallvoice, bound to do honor to the older brother whohad trained him even if he broke a vessel in theattempt. Billy chose a well-worn piece, but gave it anew interest by his style of delivery; for his gestureswere so spasmodic he looked as if going into a fit,and he did such astonishing things with his voice thatone never knew whether a howl or a growl wouldcome next. When"The woods against a stormy skyTheir giant branches tossed; "Billy's arms went round like the sails of a windmill;the "hymns of lofty cheer" not only "shook thedepths of the desert gloom," but the small childrenon their little benches, and the school-house literallyrang "to the anthems of the free!" When "theocean eagle soared," Billy appeared to be goingbodily up, and the "pines of the forest roared" as ifthey had taken lessons of Van Amburgh's biggestlion. "Woman's fearless eye" was expressed by awild glare; manhood's brow, severely high," by asudden clutch at the reddish locks falling over theorator's hot forehead, and a sounding thump on hisblue checked bosom told where "the fiery heart ofyouth" was located. "What sought they thus far?"he asked, in such a natural and inquiring tone, with hiseye fixed on Mamie Peters, that the startled innocentreplied, "Dunno," which caused the speaker to closein haste, devoutly pointing a stubby finger upward atthe last line.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　This was considered the gem of the collection, andBilly took his seat proudly conscious that his nativetown boasted an orator who, in time, would utterlyeclipse Edward Everett and Wendell Phillips.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Sally Folsom led off with "The Coral Grove,"chosen for the express purpose of making her friendAlmira Mullet start and blush, when she recited thesecond line of that pleasing poem,"Where the purple mullet and gold-fish rove."One of the older girls gave Wordsworth's "LostLove" in a pensive tone, clasping her hands andbringing out the "O" as if a sudden twinge oftoothache seized her when she ended.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"But she is in her grave, and O,'he difference to me!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Bab always chose a funny piece, and on this afternoonset them all laughing by the spirit with whichshe spoke the droll poem, "Pussy's Class," which someof my young readers may have read. The "meou"and the "sptzz" were capital, and when the "fondmamma rubbed her nose," the children shouted, forMiss Bab made a paw of her hand and ended with animpromptu purr, which was considered the best imitationever presented to an appreciative public. Bettybashfully murmurred "Little White Lily," swaying toand fro as regularly as if in no other way could therhymes be ground out of her memory.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"That is all, I believe. If either of the ladies wouldlike to say a few words to the children, I shouldbe pleased to have them," said Teacher, politely,pausing before she dismissed school with a song.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Please, 'm. I'd like to speak my piece," answeredMiss Celia, obeying a sudden impulse; and, steppingforward with her hat in her hand, she made a prettycourtesy before she recited Mary Howitt's sweet littleballad, "Mabel on Midsummer Day."She looked so young and merry, and used suchsimple but expressive gestures, and spoke in such aclear, soft voice that the children sat as if spell-bound,learning several lessons from this new teacher, whoseperformance charmed them from beiginning to end, andleft a moral which all could understand and carryaway in that last verse, --"'Tis good to make all duty sweet,To be alert and kind;'Tis good, like Littie Mabel,To have a willing mind."Of course there was an enthusiastic clapping whenMiss Celia sat down, but even while hands applauded,consciences pricked, and undone tasks, complainingwords and sour faces seemed to rise up reproachfullybefore many of the children, as well as their ownfaults of elocution.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Now we will sing," said Teacher, and a greatclearing of throats ensued, but before a note could beuttered, the half-open door swung wide, and Sancho,with Ben's hat on, walked in upon his hind-legs, andstood with his paws meekly folded, while a voice fromthe entry sang rapidly, --"Benny had a little dog,His fleece was white as snow,And everywhere that Benny went,The dog was sure to go.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　He went into the School one day,which was against the rule;It made the children laugh and playTo see a dog --"Mischievous Thorny got no further, for a generalexplosion of laughter drowned the last words, andBen's command "Out, you rascal!" sent Sanch to theright-about in double-quick time.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Miss Celia tried to apologize for her bad brother,and Teacher tried to assure her that it didn't matterin the least, as this was always a merry time, andMrs. Moss vainly shook her finger at her naughtydaughters; they as well as the others would havetheir laugh out,a nd only partially sobered down whenthe Bell rang for "Attention." They thought theywere to be dismissed, and repressed their giggles aswell as they could in order to get a good start for avociferous roar when they got out. But, to their greatsurprise, the pretty lady stood up again and said, inher friendly way, --"I just want to thank you for this pleasant littleexhibition, and ask leave to come again. I also wish toinvite you all to my boy's birthday party on Saturdayweek. The archery meeting is to be in the afternoon,and both clubs will be there, I believe. In the eveningwe are going to have some fun, when we can laughas much as we please without breaking any of therules. In Ben's name I invite you, and hope you willall come, for we mean to make this the happiestbirthday he ever had."There were twenty pupils in the room, but theeighty hands and feet made such a racket at thisannouncement that an outsider would have thought ahundred children, at least, must have been at it. MissCelia was a general favorite because she nodded to allthe girls, called the boys by their last names, evenaddressing some of the largest as "Mr." which wontheir hearts at once, so that if she had invited themall to come and be whipped they would have gonesure that it was some delightful joke. With whateagerness they accepted the present invitation onecan easily imagine, though they never guessed whyshe gave it in that way, and Ben's face was a sight tosee, he was so pleased and proud at the honor donehim that he did not know where to look, and was gladto rush out with the other boys and vent his emotionsin whoops of delight. He knew that some little plotwas being concocted for his birthday, but neverdreamed of any thing so grand as asking the wholeschool, Teacher and all. The effect of the invitationwas seen with comical rapidity, for the boys becameoverpowering in their friendly attentions to Ben.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Even Sam, fearing he might be left out, promptlyoffered the peaceful olive-branch in the shape of abig apple, warm from his pocket, and Mose proposeda trade of jack-knives which would be greatly toBen's advantage. But Thorny made the noblestsacrifice of all, for he said to his sister, as they walkedhome together, --"I'm not going to try for the prize at all. I shootso much better than the rest, having had more practice,you know, that it is hardly fair. Ben and Billyare next best, and about even, for Ben's strong wristmakes up for Billy's true eye, and both want to win.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　If I am out of the way Ben stands a good chance, forthe other fellows don't amount to much.""Bab does; she shoots nearly as well as Ben, andwants to win even more than he or Billy. She musthave her chance at any rate.""So she may, but she won't do any thing; girlscan't, though it 's good exercise and pleases them totry. ""If I had full use of both my arms I'd show youthat girls can do a great deal when they like. Don'tbe too lofty, young man, for you may have to comedown," laughed Miss Celia, amused by his airs.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No fear," and Thorny calmly departed to set histargets for Ben's practice.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"We shall see," and from that moment Miss Celiamade Bab her especial pupil, feeling that a little lessonwould be good for Mr. Thorny, who rather lorded itover the other young people. There was a spice ofmischief in it, for Miss Celia was very young at heart,in spite of her twenty-four years, and she was boundto see that her side had a fair chance, believing thatgirls can do whatever they are willing to strive patientlyand wisely for.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　So she kept Bab at work early and late, giving herall the hints and help she could with only one efficienthand, and Bab was delighted to think she did wellenough to shoot with the club. Her arms ached andher fingers grew hard with twanging the bow, but shewas indefatigable, and being a strong, tall child of herage, with a great love of all athletic sports, she got onfast and well, soon learning to send arrow after arrowwith ever increasing accuracy nearer and nearer tothe bull's-eye.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The boys took very little notice of her, being muchabsorbed in their own affairs, but Betty did for Babwhat Sancho did for Ben, and trotted after arrows tillher short legs were sadly tired, though her patiencenever gave out. She was so sure Bab would win thatshe cared nothing about her own success, practisinglittle and seldom hitting any thing when she tried.
