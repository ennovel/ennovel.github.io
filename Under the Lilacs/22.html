While waiting forJack to open the chestnut burrs, they varied themonotony of school life by a lively scrimmage longknown as "the wood-pile fight."The girls liked to play in the half-empty shed, andthe boys, merely for the fun of teasing, declared thatthey should not, so blocked up the doorway as fast asthe girls cleared it. Seeing that the squabble was amerry one,and the exercise better for all than loungingin the sun or reading in school during recess, Teacherdid not interfere, and the barrier rose and fell almostas regularly as the tide.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　It would be difficult to say which side worked theharder; for the boys went before school began tobuild up the barricade, and the girls stayed afterlessons were over to pull down the last one made inafternoon recess. They had their play-time first;and, while the boys waited inside, they heard theshouts of the girls, the banging of the wood, and thefinal crash, as the well-packed pile went down. Then,as the lassies came in, rosy, breathless, and triumphant,the lads rushed out to man the breach, and labor gallantlytill all was as tight as hard blows could make it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　So the battle raged, and bruised knuckles, splintersin fingers, torn clothes, and rubbed shoes, were theonly wounds received, while a great deal of fun washad out of the maltreated logs, and a lasting peacesecured between two of the boys.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　When the party was safely over, Sam began to fallinto his old way of tormenting Ben by calling names,as it cost no exertion to invent trying speeches, andslyly utter them when most likely to annoy. Benbore it as well as he could; but fortune favored himat last, as it usually does the patient, and he was bleto make his own terms with his tormentor.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　When the girls demolished the wood-pile, they performeda jubilee chorus on combs, and tin kettles,played like tambourines; the boys celebrated theirvictories with shrill whistles, and a drum accompanimentwith fists on the shed walls. Billy brought hisdrum, and this was such an addition that Sam huntedup an old one of his little brother's, in order that hemight join the drum corps. He had no sticks, however,and, casting about in his mind for a goodsubstitute for the genuine thing, bethought him ofbulrushes.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Those will do first-rate, and there are lots in thema'sh, if I can only get 'em," he said to himself, andturned off from the road on his way home to get asupply.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Now, this marsh was a treacherous spot, and thetragic story was told of a cow who got in there andsank till nothing was visible but a pair of horns abovethe mud, which suffocated the unwary beast. For thisreason it was called "Cowslip Marsh," the wags said,though it was generally believed to be so named forthe yellow flowers which grew there in great profusionin the spring.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Sam had seen Ben hop nimbly from one tuft ofgrass to another when he went to gather cowslips forBetty, and the stout boy thought he could do thesame. Two or three heavy jumps landed him, notamong the bulrushes, as he had hoped, but in a poolof muddy water, where he sank up to his middle withalarming rapidity. Much scared, he tried to wade out,but could only flounder to a tussock of grass, andcling there, while he endeavored to kick his legs free.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　He got them out, but struggled in vain to coil themup or to hoist his heavy body upon the very smallisland in this sea of mud. Down they splashedagain; and Sam gave a dismal groan as he thoughtof the leeches and water-snakes which might be lyingin wait below. Visions of the lost cow also flashedacross his agitated mind, and he gave a despairingshout very like a distracted "Moo!"Few people passed along the lane, and the sun wassetting, so the prospect of a night in the marsh nervedSam to make a frantic plunge toward the bulrushisland, which was nearer than the mainland, andlooked firmer than any tussock round him. But hefailed to reach this haven of rest, and was forced to stopat an old stump which stuck up, looking very like themoss-grown horns of the "dear departed." Roostinghere, Sarn began to shout for aid in every key possibleto the human voice. Such hoots and howls, whistlesand roars, never woke the echoes of the lonely marshbefore, or scared the portly frog who resided there incalm seclusion.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　He hardly expected any reply but the astonishedCaw!" of the crow, who sat upon a fence watchinghim with gloomy interest; and when a cheerful"Hullo, there!" sounded from the lane, he was sograteful that tears of joy rolled down his fat cheeks.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Come on! I'm in the ma'sh. Lend a hand andget me out! bawled Sam, anxiously waiting for hisdeliverer to appear, for he could only see a hat bobbingalong behind the hazel-bushes that fringed the lane.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Steps crashed through the bushes, and then overthe wall came an active figure, at the sight of whichSam was almost ready to dive out of sight, for, of allpossible boys, who should it be but Ben, the last personin the world whom he would like to have seehim in his present pitiful plight.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Is it you, Sam? Well, you are in a nice fix!"and Ben's eyes began to twinkle with mischievousmerriment, as well they might, for Sam certainly wasa spectacle to convulse the soberest person. Perchedunsteadily on the gnarled stump, with his muddy legsdrawn up, his dismal face splashed with mud, and thewhole lower half of his body as black as if he hadbeen dipped in an inkstand, he presented such acomically doleful object that Ben danced about,laughing like a naughty will-o'-the-wisp who, havingled a traveller astray then fell to jeering at him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Stop that, or I'll knock your head off!" roaredSam, in a rage.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Come on and do it; I give you leave," answeredBen, sparring away derisively as the other tottered onhis perch, and was forced to hold tight lest he shouldtumble off.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Don't laugh, there 's a good chap, but fish me outsomehow, or I shall get my death sitting here all wetand cold," whined Sam, changing his tune, and feelingbitterly that Ben had the upper hand now.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ben felt it also; and, though a very good-naturedboy, could not resist the temptation to enjoy thisadvantage for a moment at least.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I won't laugh if I can help it; only you do lookso like a fat, speckled frog, I may not be able to holdin. I'll pull you out pretty soon; but first I'm goingto talk to you, Sam," said Ben, sobering down as hetook a seat on the little point of land nearest thestranded Samuel.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Hurry up, then; I'm as stiff as a board now, andit's no fun sitting here on this knotty old thing,"growled Sam, with a discontented squirm.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Dare say not, but 'it is good for you,' as you saywhen you rap me over the head. Look here, I'vegot you in a tight place, and I don't mean to helpyou a bit till you promise to let me alone. Nowthen!" and Ben's face grew stern with his rememberedwrongs as he grimly eyed his discomfited foe.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I'll promise fast enough if you won't tell anyoneabout this," answered Sam, surveying himself and hissurroundings with great disgust.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I shall do as I like about that.""Then I won't promise a thing! I'm not goingto have the whole school laughing at me," protestedSam, who hated to be ridiculed even more than Bendid.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Very well; good-night!" and Ben walked offwith his hands in his pockets as coolly as if the bogwas Sam's favorite retreat.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Hold on, don't be in such a hurry!" shouted Sam,seeing little hope of rescue if he let this chance go.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"All right! " and back came Ben, ready for furthernegotiations.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I'll promise not to plague you, if you'll promisenot to tell on me. Is that what you want?""Now I come to think of it, there is one thingmore. I like to make a good bargain when I begin,"said Ben, with a shrewd air. " You must promise tokeep Mose quiet, too. He follows your lead, and ifyou tell him to stop it he will. If I was big enough,I'd make you hold your tongues. I ain't, so we'lltry this way.""Yes, Yes, I'll see to Mose. Now, bring on a rail,there's a good fellow. I've got a horrid cramp inmy legs," began Sam, thinking he had bought helpdearly, yet admiring Ben's cleverness in making themost of his chance.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ben brought the rail, but, just as he was about tolay it from the main-land to the nearest tussock, hestopped, saying, with the naughty twinkle in his blackeyes again, "One more little thing must be settledfirst, and then I'll get you ashore. promise youwon't plague the girls either, 'specially Bab andBetty. You pull their hair, and they don't like it.""Don't neither! Wouldn't touch that Bab for adollar; she scratches and bites like a mad cat," wasSam's sulky reply.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Glad of it; she can take care of herself. Bettycan't; and if you touch one of her pig-tails I'll upand tell right out how I found you snivelling in thema'sh like a great baby. So now!" and Ben emphasizedhis threat with a blow of the suspended railwhich splashed the water over poor Sam, quenchinghis last spark of resistance.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Stop! I will! -- I will!""True as you live and breathe!" demanded Ben,sternly binding him by the most solemn oath heknew.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"True as I live and breathe," echoed Sam, dolefullyrelinquishing his favorite pastime of pullingBetty's braids and asking if she was at home.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I'll come over there and crook fingers on thebargain," said Ben, settling the rail and running overit to the tuft, then bridging another pool and crossingagain till he came to the stump.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I never thought of that way," said Sam, watchinghim with much inward chagrin at his own failure.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I should think you'd written 'Look before youleap,' in your copy-book often enough to get the ideainto your stupid head. Come, crook," commandedBen, leaning forward with extended little finger.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Sam obediently performed the ceremony, and thenBen sat astride one of the horns of the stump whilethe muddy Crusoe went slowly across the rail frompoint to point till he landed safely on the shore,when he turned about and asked with an ungratefuljeer, --"Now what's going to become of you, old Look-before-you-leap ? ""Mud turtles can only sit on a stump and bawl tillthey are taken off, but frogs have legs worth something,and are not afraid of a little water," answeredBen, hopping away in an opposite direction, sincethe pools between him and Sam were too wide foreven his lively legs.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Sam waddled off to the brook in the lane torinse the mud from his nether man before facing hismother, and was just wringing himself out when Bencame up, breathless but good natured, for he felt thathe had made an excellent bargain for himself andfriends.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Better wash your face; it's as speckled as atiger-lily. Here's my handkerchief if yours is wet,"he said, pulling out a dingy article which hadevidently already done service as a towel.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Don't want it," muttered Sam, gruffly, as hepoured the water out of his muddy shoes.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I was taught to say ' Thanky' when folks got meout of scrapes. But you never had much bringingup, though you do 'live in a house with a gambrelroof,'" retorted Ben, sarcastically quoting Sam'sfrequent boast; then he walked off, much disgustedwith the ingratitude of man.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Sam forgot his manners, but he remembered hispromise, and kept it so well that all the schoolwondered. No one could guess the secret of Ben's powerover him, though it was evident that he had gainedit in some sudden way, for at the least sign of Sam'sformer tricks Ben would crook his little finger andwag it warningly, or call out "Bulrushes!" and Samsubsided with reluctant submission, to the greatamazement of his mates. When asked what it meant,Sa, turned sulky; but Ben had much fun out of it,assuring the other boys that those were the signsand password of a secret society to which he andSam belonged, and promised to tell them all about itif Sam would give him leave, which, of course, hewould not.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　This mystery, and the vain endeavors to find itout caused a lull in the war of the wood-pile, andbefore any new game was invented something happenedwhich gave the children plenty to talk about for atime.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　A week after the secret alliance was formed, Benran in one evening with a letter for Miss Celia. Hefound her enjoying the cheery blaze of the pine-conesthe little girls had picked up for her, and Bab andBetty sat in the small chairs rocking luxuriously asthey took turns to throw on the pretty fuel. MissCelia turned quickly to receive the expected letter,glanced at the writing, post-mark and stamp, withan air of delighted surprise, then clasped it closein both hands, saying, as she hurried out of theroom, --"He has come! he has come! Now you may tellthem, Thorny.""Tell its what? asked Bab, pricking up her carsat once.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Oh, it's only that George has come, and I supposewe shall go and get married right away," answeredThorny, rubbing his hands as if he enjoyedthe prospect.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Are you going to be married? asked Betty, so soberlythat the boys shouted, and Thorny, with difficultycomposed himself sufficiently to explain.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No, child, not just yet; but sister is, and I mustgo and see that all is done up ship-shape, and bringyou home some wedding-cake. Ben will take careof you while I'm gone.""When shall you go?" asked Bab, beginning to longfor her share of cake.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"To-morrow, I guess. Celia has been packed andready for a week. We agreed to meet George in NewYork, and be married as soon as he got his best clothesunpacked. We are men of our word, and off we go.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Won't it be fun?""But when will you come back again?" questionedBetty, looking anxious.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Don't know. Sister wants to come soon, but I'drather have our honeymoon somewhere else, -- Niagara,Newfoundland, West Point, or the Rocky Mountains,"said Thorny, mentioning a few of the places hemost desired to see.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Do you like him?" asked Ben, very naturally wonderingif the new master would approve of the young man-of-all-work.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Don't I? George is regularly jolly; though nowhe's a minister, perhaps he'll stiffen up and turn sober.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Won't it be a shame if he does?" and Thorny lookedalarmed at the thought of losing his congenial friend.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Tell about him; Miss Celia said you might", putin Bab, whuse experience of "jolly" ministers hadbeen small.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Oh, there isn't much about it. We met in Switzerlandgoing up Mount St. Bernard in a storm, and -- ""Where the good dogs live?" inquired Betty, hopingthey would come into the story.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Yes; we spent the night up there, and Georgegave us his room; the house was so full, and hewouldn't let me go down a steep place where I wantedto, and Celia thought he'd saved my life, and was verygood to him. Then we kept meeting, and the first thingI knew she went and was engaged to him. I didn'tcare, only she would come home so he might go onstudying hard and get through quick. That was a yearago, and last winter we were in New York at uncle's;and then, in the spring, I was sick, and we came here,and that's all.""Shall you live here always when you come back?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　asked Bab, as Thorny paused for breath.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Celia wants to. I shall go to college, so I don'tmind. George is going to help the old minister hereand see how he likes it. I'm to study with him, andif he is as pleasant as he used to be we shall havecapital times, -- see if we don't.""I wonder if he will want me round," said Ben,feeling no desire to be a tramp again.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I do, so you needn't fret about that, my hearty,"answered Thorny, with a resounding slap on theshoulder which reassured Ben more than any promises.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I'd like to see a live wedding, then we could playit with our dolls. I've got a nice piece of mosquitonetting for a veil, and Belinda's white dress is clean.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Do you s'pose Miss Celia will ask us to hers?" saidBetty to Bab, as the boys began to discuss St. Bernarddogs with Spirit.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I wish I could, dears," answered a voice behindthem; and there was Miss Celia, looking so happy thatthe little girls wondered what the letter could have saidto give her such bright eyes and smiling lips." I shallnot be gone long, or be a bit changed when I comeback, to live among you years I hope, for I am fondof the old place now, and mean it shall be home," sheadded, caressing the yellow heads as if they were dearto her.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Oh, goody!" cried Bab, while Betty whisperedwith both arms round Miss Celia, --"I don't think we could bear to have anybody elsecome here to live.""It is very pleasant to hear you say that, and I meanto make others feel so, if I can. I have been trying alittle this summer, but when I come back I shall go towork in earnest to be a good minister's wife, and youmust help me.""We will," promised both children, ready for anything except preaching in the high pulpit.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Then Miss Celia turned to Ben, saying, in therespectful way that always made him feel at leasttwenty-five, --"We shall be off to-moriow, and I leave you incharge. Go on just as if we were here, and be surenothing will be changed as far as you are concernedwhen we come back."Ben's face beamed at that; but the only way hecould express his relief was by making such a blazein honor of the occasion that he nearly roasted thecompany.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Next morning, the brother and sister slipped quietlyaway, and the children hurried to school, eager to tellthe great news that "Miss Celia and Thorny had goneto be married, and were coming back to live here forever and ever."
