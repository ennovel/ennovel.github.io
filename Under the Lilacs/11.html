Ben had forgotten his troubles in sleep;but the memory of them returned as soon as he openedhis eyes, heavy with the tears they had shed. Hedid not cry any more, but felt strange and lonelytill he called Sancho and told him all about it, forhe was shy even with kind Mrs. Moss, and gladwhen she went away.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Sancho seemed to understand that his master wasin trouble, and listened to the sad little story withgurgles of interest, whines of condolence, and intelligentbarks whenever the word "daddy " was uttered. He was onlya brute, but his dumb affection comforted the boy morethan any words; for Sanch had known and loved "father"almost as long and well as his son, and that seemed todraw them closely together, now they were left alone.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"We must put on mourning, old feller. It's theproper thing, and there's nobody else to do it now,"said Ben, as he dressed, remembering how all thecompany wore bits of crape somewhere about themat 'Melia's funeral.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　It was a real sacrifice of boyish vanity to take theblue ribbon with its silver anchors off the new hat,and replace it with the dingy black band from theold one; but Ben was quite sincere in doing this,though doubtless his theatrical life made him thinkof the effect more than other lads would have done.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　He could find nothing in his limited wardrobe withwhich to decorate Sanch except a black cambricpocket. It was already half torn out of his trouserswith the weight of nails, pebbles, and other lighttrifles; so he gave it a final wrench and tied itinto the dog's collar, saying to himself, as he putaway his treasures, with a sigh,--"One pocket is enough; I sha'n't want anythingbut a han'k'chi'f to-day."Fortunately, that article of dress was clean, for hehad but one; and, with this somewhat ostentatiouslydrooping from the solitary pocket, the serious hatupon his head, the new shoes creaking mournfully,and Sanch gravely following, much impressed withhis black bow, the chief mourner descended, feelingthat he had done his best to show respect to thedead.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Mrs. Moss's eyes filled as she saw the rusty band,and guessed why it was there; but she found it difficultto repress a smile when she beheld the cambricsymbol of woe on the dog's neck. Not a word wassaid to disturb the boy's comfort in these poor attempts,however; and he went out to do his chores, conscious thathe was an object of interest to his friends, especially soto Bab and Betty, who, havinq been told of Ben's loss, nowregarded him with a sort of pitying awe very grateful to hisfeelings.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I want you to drive me to church by-and-by.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　It is going to be pretty warm, and Thorny is hardlystrong enough to venture yet," said Miss Celia, whenBen ran over after breakfast to see if she had anything for him to do; for he considered her his mistressnow, though he was not to take possession ofhis new quarters till the morrow.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Yes, 'm, I'd like to, if I look well enough,"answered Ben, pleased to be asked, but impressedwith the idea that people had to be very fine onsuch occasions.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You will do very well when I have given you atouch. God doesn't mind our clothes, Ben, and thepoor are as welcome as the rich to him. You havenot been much, have you?" asked Miss Celia, anxiousto help the boy, and not quite sure how to begin.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No, 'm; our folks didn't hardly ever go, andfather was so tired he used to rest Sundays, or gooff in the woods with me."A little quaver came into Ben's voice as he spoke,and a sudden motion made his hat-brim hide his eyes,for the thought of the happy times that would nevercome any more was almost too much for him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"That was a pleasant way to rest. I often do so,and we will go to the grove this afternoon and try it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　But I have to go to church in the morning,; it seems tostart me right for the week; and if one has a sorrowthat is the place where one can always find comfort.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Will you come and try it, Ben, dear?""I'd do any thing to please you," muttered Ben,without looking up; for, though he felt her kindnessto the bottom of his heart, he did wish that no onewould talk about father for a little while; it was sohard to keep from crying, and he hated to be ababy.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Miss Celia seemed to understand, for the next thingshe said, in a very cheerful tone, was, "See what apretty sight that is. When I was a little girl I usedto think spiders spun cloth for the fairies, and spreadit on the grass to bleach."Ben stopped digging a hole in the ground with histoe, and looked up, to see a lovely cobweb like awheel, circle within circle, spun across a corner ofthe arch over the gate. Tiny drops glittered on everythread as the light shone through the gossamer curtain,and a soft breath of air made it tremble as ifabout to blow it away.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It's mighty pretty, but it will fly off. just as theothers did. I never saw such a chap as that spideris. He keeps on spinning a new one every day, forthey always get broke. and he don't seem to bediscouraged a mite," said Ben, glad to change thesubject, as she knew he would be.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"That is the way he gets his living. he spins hisweb and waits for his daily bread, -- or fly, rather;and it always comes, I fancy. By-and-by you willsee that pretty trap full of insects, and Mr. Spiderwill lay up his provisions for the day. After that hedoesn't care how soon his fine web blows away.""I know him; he's a handsome feller, all blackand yellow, and lives up in that corner where theshiny sort of hole is. He dives down the minute Itouch the gate, but comes up after I've kept still aminute. I like to watch him. But he must hate me,for I took away a nice green fly and some littlemillers one day.""Did you ever hear the story of Bruce and hisspider? Most children know and like that," saidMiss Celia, seeing that he seemed interested.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No, 'm ; I don't know ever so many things mostchildren do," answered Ben, soberly; for, since hehad been among his new friends, he had often felthis own deficiencies.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Ah, but you also know many things which theydo not. Half the boys in town would give a greatdeal to be able to ride and run and leap as you do;and even the oldest are not as capable of taking careof themselves as you are. Your active life has donemuch in some ways to make a man of you; but inother ways it was bad, as I think you begin to see.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Now, suppose you try to forget the harmful part, andremember only the good, while learning to be morelike our boys, who go to school and church, and fitthemselves to become industrious, honest men."Ben had been looking straight up in Miss Celia'sface as she spoke, feeling that every word was true,though he could not have expressed it if he hadtried; and, when she paused, with her bright eyesinquiringly fixed on his, he answered heartily,--"I'd like to stay here and be respectable; for,since I came, I've found out that folks don't thinkmuch of circus riders, though they like to go and see'em. I didn't use to care about school and suchthings, but I do now; and I guess he'd like it betterthan to have me knockin' round that way without himto look after me.""I know he would; so we will try, Benny. I daresay it will seem dull and hard at first, after the gaysort of life you have led, and you will miss the excitement.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　But it was not good for you, and we will do our best to findsomething safer. Don't be discouraged; and, when things troubleyou, come to me as Thorny does, and I'll try to straighten themout for you. I've got two boys now, and I want todo my duty by both."Before Ben had time for more than a grateful look,a tumbled head appeared at an upper window, and asleepy voice drawled out, --"Celia! I can't find a bit of a shoe-string, and Iwish you'd come and do my neck-tie.""Lazy boy, come down here, and bring one ofyour black ties with you. Shoe-strings are in thelittle brown bag on my bureau," called back MissCelia; adding, with a laugh, as the tumbled headdisappeared mumbling something about "botheringold bags, "Thorny has been half spoiled since hewas ill. You mustn't mind his fidgets and dawdling ways.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　He'll get over them soon, and then I know you twowill be good friends."Ben had his doubts about that, but resolved todo his best for her sake; so, when Master Thornypresently appeared, with a careless "How are you,Ben?" that young person answered respectfully, --"Very well, thank you," though his nod was ascondescending as his new master's; because he feltthat a boy who could ride bareback and turn adouble somersault in the air ought not to "knuckleunder" to a fellow who had not the strength of apussy-cat.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Sailor's knot, please; keeps better so," saidThorny, holding up his chin to have a blue-silk scarftied to suit him, for he was already beginning to besomething of a dandy.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You ought to wear red till you get more color,dear;" and his sister rubbed her blooming cheekagainst his pale one, as if to lend him some of herown roses.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Men don't care how they look," said Thorny,squirming out of her hold, for he hated to be"cuddled" before people.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Oh, don't they? Here 's a vain boy who brusheshis hair a dozen times a day, and quiddles over hiscollar till he is so tired he can hardly stand," laughedMiss Celia, with a little tweak of his ear.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I should like to know what this is for? " demandedThorny, in a dignified tone, presenting a black tie.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"For my other boy. He is going to church withme," and Miss Celia tied a second knot for this younggentleman, with a smile that seemed to brighten upeven the rusty hat-band.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Well, I like that--" began Thorny, in a tonethat contradicted his words.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　A look from his sister reminded him of what shehad told him half an hour ago, and he stopped short,understanding now why she was "extra good to thelittle tramp.""So do I, for you are of no use as a driver yet,and I don't like to fasten Lita when I have my bestgloves on," said Miss Celia, in a tone that rathernettled Master Thorny.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Is Ben going to black my boots before he goes?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　with a glance at the new shoes which caused them tocreak uneasily.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No; he is going to black mine, if he will be so kind.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　You won't need boots for a week yet, so wewon't waste any time over them. You will findevery thing in the shed, Ben; and at ten you may gofor Lita."With that, Miss Celia walked her brother off to thediningroom, and Ben retired to vent his ire in suchenergetic demonstrations with the blacking-brush thatthe little boots shone splendidly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　He thought he had never seen any thing as prettyas his mistress when, an hour later, she came out ofthe house in her white shawl and bonnet, holding abook and a late lily-of-the-valley in the pearl-coloredgloves, which he hardly dared to touch as he helpedher into the carriage. He had seen a good many fineladies in his life; and those he had known had beenvery gay in the colors of their hats and gowns, veryfond of cheap jewelry, and much given to feathers,lace, and furbelows; so it rather puzzled him to discoverwhy Miss Celia looked so sweet and elegant insuch a simple suit. He did not then know that thecharm was in the woman, not the clothes; or thatmerely living near such a person would do more togive him gentle manners, good principles, and purethoughts, than almost any other training he couldhave had. But he was conscious that it was pleasantto be there, neatly dressed, in good company, andgoing to church like a respectable boy. Somehow,the lonely feeling got better as be rolled alongbetween green fields, with the June sunshine brighteningevery thing, a restful quiet in the air, and a friendbeside him who sat silently looking out at the lovelyworld with what he afterward learned to call her"Sunday face," -- a soft, happy look, as if all thework and weariness of the past week were forgotten,and she was ready to begin afresh when this blessedday was over.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Well, child, what is it?" she asked, catching hiseye as he stole a shy glance at her, one of many whichshe had not seen.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I was only thinking, you looked as if --""As if what? Don't be afraid," she said, for Benpaused and fumbled at the reins, feeling half ashamedto tell his fancy.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You were saying prayers," he added, wishingshe had not caught him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"So I was. Don't you, when you are happy?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No,'m. I'm glad, but I don't say any thing.""Words are not needed; but they help, sometimes,if they are sincere and sweet. Did you never learnany prayers, Ben?""Only 'Now I lay me.' Grandma taught me thatwhen I was a little mite of a boy.""I will teach you another, the best that was evermade, because it says all we need ask.""Our folks wasn't very pious; they didn't havetime, I s'pose.""I wonder if you know just what it means to bepious?""Goin' to church, and readin' the Bible, and sayin'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　prayers and hymns, ain't it?""Those things are a part of it; but being kind andcheerful, doing one's duty, helping others, and lovingGod, is the best way to show that we are pious in thetrue sense of the word.""Then you are! " and Ben looked as if her acts hadbeen a better definition than her words.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I try to be, but I very often fail; so every SundayI make new resolutions, and work hard to keep themthrough the week. That is a great help, as you willfind when you begin to try it.""Do you think if I said in meetin', ' I won't everswear any more,' that I wouldn't do it again?" askedBen, soberly; for that was his besetting sin just now.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I'm afraid we can't get rid of our faults quite soeasily; I wish we could: but I do believe that if youkeep saying that, and trying to stop, you will cure thehabit sooner than you think.""I never did swear very bad, and I didn't mindmuch till I came here; but Bab and Betty looked soscared when I said 'damn,' and Mrs. Moss scoldedme so, I tried to leave off. It's dreadful hard, though,when I get mad. 'Hang it!' don't seem half so goodif I want to let off steam.""Thorny used to 'confound!' every thing, so Iproposed that he should whistle instead; and now hesometimes pipes up so suddenly and shrilly that itmakes me jump. How would that do, instead ofswearing?" proposed Miss Celia, not the least surprisedat the habit of profanity, which the boy couldhardly help learning among his former associates.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ben laughed, and promised to try it, feeling a mischievoussatisfaction at the prospect of out-whistlingMaster Thorny, as he knew he should; for the objectionablewords rose to his lips a dozen times a day.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The Ben was ringing as they drove into town; and,by the time Lita was comfortably settled in her shed,people were coming up from all quarters to clusteraround the steps of the old meeting-house like beesabout a hive. Accustomed to a tent, where peoplekept their hats on, Ben forgot all about his, and wasgoing down the aisle covered, when a gentle handtook it off, and Miss Celia whispered, as she gave itto him, --"This is a holy place; remember that, and uncoverat the door."Much abashed, Ben followed to the pew, where theSquire and his wife soon joined them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Glad to see him here," said the old gentlemanwith an appioving nod, as he recognized the boy andremembered his loss.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Hope he won't nestle round in meeting-time,"whispered Mrs. Allen, composing herself in the cornerwith much rustling of black silk.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I'll take care that he doesn't disturb you," answeredMiss Celia, pushing a stool under the shortlegs, and drawing a palm-leaf fan within reach.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ben gave an inward sigh at the prospect beforehim; for an hour's captivity to an active lad is hardto bear, and he really did want to behave well. Sohe folded his arms and sat like a statue, with nothingmoving but his eyes. They rolled to and fro, up anddown, from the high red pulpit to the worn hymnbooksin the rack, recognizing two little faces underblue-ribboned hats in a distant pew, and finding itimpossible to restrain a momentary twinkle in returnfor the solemn wink Billy Barton bestowed upon himacross the aisle. Ten minutes of this decorous demeanormade it absolutely necessary for him to stir;so he unfolded his arms and crossed his legs ascautiously as a mouse moves in the presence of acat; for Mrs. Allen's eye was on him, and he knew byexperience that it was a very sharp one.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The music which presently began was a great reliefto him, for under cover of it he could wag his footand no one heard the creak thereof; and when theystood up to sing, he was so sure that all the boys werelooking at him, he was glad to sit down again. Thegood old minister read the sixteenth chapter of Samuel,and then proceeded to preach a long and somewhat dullsermon. Ben listened with all his ears, forhe was interested in the young shepherd, " uddy andof a beautiful countenance," who was chosen to beSaul's armor-bearer. He wanted to hear more abouthim, and how he got on, and whether the evil spiritstroubled Saul again after David had harped themout. But nothing more came; and the old gentlemandroned on about other things till poor Ben felt thathe must either go to sleep like the Squire, or tip thestool over by accident, since "nestling" was forbidden,and relief of some sort he must have.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Mrs. Allen gave him a peppermint, and he dutifullyate it, though it was so hot it made his eyes water.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Then she fanned him, to his great annoyance, for itblew his hair about; and the pride of his life was tohave his head as smooth and shiny as black satin.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　An irrepressible sigh of weariness attracted MissCelia's attention at last; for, though she seemed tobe listening devoutly, her thoughts had flown overthe sea, with tender prayers for one whom she lovedeven more than David did his Jonathan. She guessedthe trouble in a minute, and had provided for it, knowingby experience that few small boys can keep quietthrough sermon-time. Finding a certain place in thelittle book she had brought, she put it into his hands,with the whisper, "Read if you are tired."Ben clutched the book and gladly obeyed, thoughthe title, "Scripture Narratives," did not look veryinviting. Then his eye fell on the picture of a slenderyouth cutting a large man's head off, while manypeople stood looking on.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Jack, the giant-killer," thought Ben, and turnedthe page to see the words "David and Goliath",which was enough to set him to reading the storywith great interest; for here was the shepherd boyturned into a hero. No more fidgets now; the sermonwas no longer heard, the fan flapped unfelt, andBilly Barton's spirited sketches in the hymnbookwere vainly held up for admiration. Ben was quiteabsorbed in the stirring history of King David, toldin a way that fitted it for children's reading, and illustratedwith fine pictures which charmed the boy's eye.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Sermon and story ended at the same time; and,while he listened to the prayer, Ben felt as if he understoodnow what Miss Celia meant by saying thatwords helped when they were well chosen and sincere.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Several petitions seemed as if especially intended forhim; and he repeated them to himself that he mightremember them, they sounded so sweet and comfortableheard for the first time just when he mostneeded comfort. Miss Celia saw a new expressionin the boy's face as she glanced down at him, andheard a little huniming at her side when all stood upto sing the cheerful hymn with which they weredismissed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"How do you like church?" asked the young lady,as they drove away.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"First-rate!" answered Ben, heartily.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Especially the sermon?"Ben laughed, and said, with an affectionate glanceat the little book in her lap,--"I couldn't understand it; but that story was justelegant. There's more; and I'd admire to read 'em,if I could.""I'm glad you like them; and we will keep therest for another sermon-time. Thorny used to doso, and always called this his 'pew book.' I don'texpect you to understand much that you hear yetawhile; but it is good to be there, and after readingthese stories you will be more interested when youhear the names of the people mentioned here.""Yes, 'm. Wasn't David a fine feller? I liked allabout the kid and the corn and the ten cheeses, andkillin' the lion and bear, and slingin' old Goliath deadfirst shot. I want to know about Joseph next time,for I saw a gang of robbers puttin' him in a hole, andit looked real interesting."Miss Celia could not help smiling at Ben's way oftelling things; but she was pleased to see that he wasattracted by the music and the stories, and resolvedto make church-going so pleasant that he would learnto love it for its own sake.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Now, you have tried my way this morning, andwe will try yours this afternoon. Come over aboutfour and help me roll Thorny down to the grove. Iam going to put one of the hanmmocks there, becausethe smell of the pines is good for him, and you cantalk or read or amuse yourselves in any quiet wayyou like.""Can I take Sanch along? He doesn't like to beleft, and felt real bad because I shut him up, for fearhe'd follow and come walkin' into meetin' to find me.""Yes, indeed; let the clever Bow-wow have a goodtime and enjoy Sunday as much as I want my boys to."Quite content with this arrangement, Ben went hometo dinner, which he made very lively by recountingBilly Barton's ingenious devices to beguile the tediumof sermon time. He said nothing of his conversationwith Miss Celia, because he had not quite made uphis mind whether he liked it or not; it was so newand serious, he felt as if he had better lay it by, tothink over a good deal before he could understand allabout it. But he had time to get dismal again, andlong for four o'clock; because he had nothing to doexcept whittle. Mrs. Moss went to take a nap; Baband Betty sat demurely on their bench reading Sundaybooks; no boys were allowed to come and play;even the hens retired under the currant-bushes, andthe cock stood among them, clucking drowsily, as ifreading them a sermon.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div>

 　　"Dreadful slow day!" thought Ben; and, retiringto the recesses of his own room, he read over the twoletters which seemed already old to him. Now thatthe first shock was over, he could not make it truethat his father was dead, and he gave up trying; forhe was an honest boy, and felt that it was foolish topretend to be more unhappy than he really was. Sohe put away his letters, took the black pocket offSanch's neck, and allowed himself to whistle softly ashe packed up his possessions, ready to move nextday, with few regrets and many bright anticipationsfor the future.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Thorny, I want you to be good to Ben, andamuse him in some quiet way this afternoon. Imust stay and see the Morrises, who are comingover; but you can go to the grove and have apleasant time," said Miss Celia to her brother.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Not much fun in talking to that horsey fellow.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　I'm sorry for him, but I can't do anything to amusehim," objected Thorny, pulling himself up from thesofa with a great yawn.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　You can be very agreeable when you like; andBen has had enough of me for this time. To-morrowhe will have his work, and do very well; but wemust try to help him through to-day, because hedoesn't know what to do with himself. Besides, itis just the time to make a good impression on him,while grief for his father softens him, and gives us achance. I like him, and I'm sure he wants to dowell; so it is our duty to help him, as there seemsto be no one else.""Here goes, then! Where is he?" and Thornystood up, won by his sister's sweet earnestness, butvery doubtful of his own success with the "horseyfellow.""Waiting with the chair. Randa has gone onwith the hammock. Be a dear boy, and I'll do asmuch for you some day.""Don't see how you can be a dear boy. You'rethe best sister that ever was; so I'lllove all thescallywags you ask me to."With a laugh and a kiss, Thorny shambled offto ascend his chariot, good-humoredly saluting hispusher, whom he found sitting on the high railbehind, with his feet on Sanch.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Drive on, Benjamin. I don't know the way, so Ican't direct. Don't spill me out, -- that's all I'vegot to say.":All right, sir," -- and away Ben trundled downthe long walk that led through the orchard to a littlegrove of seven pines.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　A pleasant spot; for a soft rustle filled the air,a brown carpet of pine needles, with fallen conesfor a pattern, lay under foot; and over the topsof the tall brakes that fringed the knoll one hadglimpses of hill and valley, farm-houses and windingriver, like a silver ribbon through the low, greenmeadows.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"A regular summer house!" said Thorny, surveyingit with approval. "What's the matter, Randa?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Won't it do?" he asked, as the stout maid droppedher arms with a puff, after vainly trying to throw thehammock rope over a branch.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"That end went up beautiful, but this one won't;the branches is so high, I can't reach 'em; and I'mno hand at flinging ropes round.""I'll fix it;" and Ben went up the pine like asquirrel, tied a stout knot, and swung himself downagain before Thorny could get out of the chair.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"My patience, what a spry boy!" exclaimedRanda, admiringly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"That 's nothing; you ought to see me shin up asmooth tent-pole," said Ben, rubbing the pitch offhis hands, with a boastful wag of the head.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You can go, Randa. just hand me my cushionand books, Ben; then you can sit in the chair whileI talk to you," commanded Thorny, tumbling intothe hammock.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"What's he goin' to say to me?" wondered Bento himself, as he sat down with Sanch sprawlingamong the wheels.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Now, Ben, I think you'd better learn a hymn; Ialways used to when I was a little chap, and it is agood thing to do Sundays," began the new teacher,with a patronizing air, which ruffled his pupil asmuch as the opprobrious term "little chap.""I'll be -- whew -- if I do! " whistled Ben, stoppingan oath just in time.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It is not polite to whistle in company," saidThorny, with great dignity.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Miss Celia told me to. I'll say 'confound it,' ifyou like that better," answered Ben, as a sly smiletwinkled in his eyes.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Oh, I see! She 's told you about it? Well,then, if you want to please her, you'll learn a hymnright off. Come, now, she wants me to be clever toyou, and I'd like to do it; but if you get peppery,how can I?"Thorny spoke in a hearty, blunt way, which suitedBen much better than the other, and he respondedpleasantly, --"If you won't be grand I won't be peppery.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Nobody is going to boss me but Miss Celia; so I'lllearn hymns if she wants me to.""'In the soft season of thy youth' is a good oneto begin with. I learned it when I was six. Nicething; better have it." And Thorny offered thebook like a patriarch addressing an infant.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ben surveyed the yellow page with small favor, forthe long s in the old-fashioned printing bewilderedhim; and when he came to the last two lines, hecould not resist reading them wrong, --"The earth affords no lovelier fightThan a religious youth.""I don't believe I could ever get that into myhead straight. Haven't you got a plain one anywhere round?" he asked, turning over the leaveswith some anxiety.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Look at the end, and see if there isn't a piece ofpoetry pasted in. You learn that, and see how funnyCelia will look when you say it to her. She wrote itwhen she was a girl, and somebody had it printed forother children. I like it best, myself."Pleased by the prospect of a little fun to cheer hisvirtuous task, Ben whisked over the leaves, and readwith interest the lines Miss Celia had written in hergirlhood:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"MY KINGDOMA little kingdom I possess,Where thoughts and feelings dwell;And very hard I find the taskOf governing it well.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　For passion tempts and troubles me,A wayward will misleads,And selfishness its shadow castsOn all my words and deeds.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"How can I learn to rule myself,To be the child I should, --Honest and brave, -- nor ever tireOf trying to be good?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　How can I keep a sunny soulTo shine along life's way?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　How can I tune my little heartTo sweetly sing all day?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Dear Father, help me With the loveThat casteth out my fear!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Teach me to lean on thee, and feelThat thou art very near;That no temptation is unseen,No childish grief too small,Since Thou, with patience infinite,Doth soothe and comfort all.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I do not ask for any crown,But that which all may willNor seek to conquer any worldExcept the one within.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Be then my guide until I find,Led by a tender hand,Thy happy kingdom in myself,And dare to take command.""I like that!" said Ben, emphatically, when he hadread the little hymn. "I understand it, and I'll learnit right away. Don't see how she could make it allcome out so nice and pretty.""Celia can do any thing!" and Thorny gave anall-embracing wave of the hand, which forciblyexpressed his firm belief in his sister's boundlesspowers.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I made some poetry once. Bab and Betty thoughtit was first-rate, I didn't," said Ben, moved to confidenceby the discovery of Miss Celia's poetic skill.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Say it," commanded Thorny, adding with tact,I can't make any to save my life, -- never couldbut I'm fond of it.""Chevalita,Pretty cretr,I do love herLike a brother;Just to rideIs my delight,For she does notKick or bite,"recited Ben, with modest pride, for his first attempthad been inspired by sincere affection, and pronounced"lovely" by the admiring girls.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Very good! You must say them to Celia, too.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　She likes to hear Lita praised. You and she and thatlittle Barlow boy ought to try for a prize, as the poetsdid in Athens. I'II tell you all about it some time.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Now, yao peg away at your hymn."Cheered by Thorny's commendation, Ben fell towork at his new task, squirming about in the chair asif the process of getting words into his memory was avery painful one. But he had quick wits, and hadoften learned comic songs; so he soon was able torepeat the four verses without mistake, much to hisown and Thorny's satisfaction.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Now we'll talk," said the well-pleased preceptor;and talk they did, one swinging in the hammock, theother rolling about on the pine-needles, as they relatedtheir experiences boy fashion. Ben's were the mostexciting; but Thorny's were not without interest,for he had lived abroad for several years, and couldtell all sorts of droll stories of the countries he hadseen.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Busied with friends, Miss Celia could not help wonderinghow the lads got on; and, when the tea-Benrang, waited a little anxiously for their return, knowingthat she could tell at a glance if they had enjoyedthernselves.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"All goes well so far," she thought, as she watchedtheir approach with a smile; for Sancho sat bolt uprightin the chair which Ben pushed, while Thornystrolled beside him, leaning on a stout cane newlycut. Both boys were talking busily, and Thornylaughed from time to time, as if his comrade's chatwas very amusing.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"See what a jolly cane Ben cut for me! He'sgreat fun if you don't stroke him the wrong way",said the elder lad, flourishing his staff as theycame up.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"What have you been doing down there? Youlook so merry, I suspect mischief," asked Miss Celia,surveying them front the steps.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"We've been as good as gold. I talked, and Benlearned a hymn to please you. Come, young man,say your piece," said Thorny, with an expression ofvirtuous content.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Taking off his hat, Ben soberly obeyed, much enjoyingthe quick color that came up in Miss Celia'sface as she listened, and feeling as if well repaid forthe labor of learning by the pleased look with whichShe said, as he ended with a bow, --"I feel very proud to think you chose that, and tohear you say it as if it meant something to you. Iwas only fourteen when I wrote it; but it came rightout of my heart, and did me good. I hope it mayhelp you a little."Ben murmured that he guessed it would; but felttoo shy to talk about such things before Thorny, sohastily retired to put the chair away, and the otherswent in to tea. But later in the evening, when MissCelia was singing like a nightingale, the boy slippedaway from sleepy Bab and Betty to stand by thesyringa bush and listen, with his heart full of newthoughts and happy feelings; for never before had hespent a Sunday like this. And when he went to bed,instead of saying "Now I lay me," he repeated thethird verse of Miss Celia's hymn; for that was hisfavorite, because his longing for the father whom hehad seen made it seem sweet and natural now to loveand lean, without fear upon the Father whom he hadnot seen.
