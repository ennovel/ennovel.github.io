<div>
 &nbsp;

<div>
 　　Tired teacher had dismissed them for eight wholeweeks, and gone away to rest; the little school-housewas shut up, lessons were over, spirits rising fast,and vacation had begun. The quiet town seemedsuddenly inundated with children, all in such arampant state that busy mothers wondered how theyever should be able to keep their frisky darlings outof mischief; thrifty fathers planned how they couldbribe the idle hands to pick berries or rake hay; andthe old folks, while wishing the young folks well,secretly blessed the man who invented schools.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The girls immediately began to talk about picnics,and have them, too; for little hats sprung up in thefields like a new sort of mushroom, -- every hillsidebloomed with gay gowns, looking as if the flowershad gone out for a walk; and the woods were full offeatherless birds chirping away as blithely as thethrushes, robins, and wrens.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The boys took to base-ball like ducks to water,and the common was the scene of tremendous battles,waged with much tumult, but little bloodshed. Tothe uninitiated, it appeared as if these young menhad lost their wits; for, no matter how warm it was,there they were, tearing about in the maddest mannet,jackets off, sleeves rolled up, queer caps flung onany way, all batting shabby leather balls, and catchingthe same, as if their lives depended on it. Everyone talking in his gruffest tone, bawling at the top ofhis voice, squabbling over every point of the game,and seeming to enjoy himself immensely, in spiteof the heat, dust, uproar, and imminent danger ofgetting eyes or teeth knocked out.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Thorny was an excellent player, but, not beingstrong enough to show his prowess, he made Benhis proxy; and, sitting on the fence, acted as umpireto his heart's content. Ben was a promising pupil,and made rapid progress; for eye, foot, and handhad been so well trained, that they did him goodservice now; and Brown was considered a first-rate"catcher".
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Sancho distinguished himself by his skill in huntingup stray balls, and guarding jackets when notneeded, with the air of one of the Old Guard on dutyat the tomb of Napoleon. Bab also longed to joinin the fun, which suited her better than "stupid picnics"or "fussing over dolls;" but her heroes would nothave her at any price; and she was obliged to contentherself with sitting by Thorny, and watchingwith breathless interest the varying fortunes of "ourside."A grand match was planned for the Fourth ofJuly; but when the club met, things were found tobe unpropitious. Thorny had gone out of town withhis sister to pass the day, two of the best players didnot appear, and the others were somewhat exhaustedby the festivities, which began at sunrise for them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　So they lay about on the grass in the shade of thebig elm, languidly discussing their various wrongsand disappointments.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It's the meanest Fourth I ever saw. Can't haveno crackers, because somebody's horse got scaredlast year," growled Sam Kitteridge, bitterly resentingthe stern edict which forbade feee-born citizens toburn as much gunpowder as they liked on that gloriousday.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Last year Jimmy got his arm blown off whenthey fired the old cannon. Didn't we have a livelytime going for the doctors and getting him home?"asked another boy, looking as if he felt defrauded ofthe most interesting part of the anniversary, becauseno accident had occurred.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Ain't going to be fireworks either, unless somebody'sbarn burns up. Don't I just wish there would,:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　gloomily responded another youth who had so rashlyindulged in pyrotechnics on a former occasion that aneighbor's cow had been roasted whole.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I wouldn't give two cents for such a slow oldplace as this. Why, last Fourth at this time, I wasrumbling thiough Boston streets on top of our bigcar, all in my best toggery. Ht as pepper, butgood fun looking in at the upper windows and hearingthe women scream when the old thing waggledround and I made believe I was going to tumble off,said Ben, leaning on his bat with the air of a manwho had seen the world and felt some natural regretat descending from so lofty a sphere.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Catch me cuttin, away if I had such a chanceas that!" answered Sam, trying to balance his bat onhis chin and getting a smart rap across the nose as hefailed to perform the feat.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Much you know about it, old chap. It's hardwork, I can tell you, and that wouldn't suit such alazy-bones. Then you are too big to begin, though youmight do for a fat boy if Smithers wanted one," saidBen, surveying the stout youth, with calm contempt.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Let's go in swimming, not loaf round here, if wecan't play," proposed a red and shiny boy, pantingfor a game of leap-frog in Sandy pond.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"May as well; don't see much else to do," sighedSam, rising like a young elephant.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The others were about to follow, when a shrill " Hi,hi, boys, hold on!" made them turn about to beholdBilly Barton tearing down the street like a runawaycolt, waving a long strip of paper as he ran.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Now, then, what's the matter? " demanded Ben,as the other came up grinning and puffing, but fullof great news.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Look here, read it! I'm going; come along,the whole of you," panted Billy, putting the paperinto Sam's hand, and surveying the crowd with a faceas beaming as a full moon.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Look out for the big show," read Sam. "VanAmburgh &amp; Co.'s New Great Golden Menagerie, Circusand Colosseum, will exhibit at Berryville, July4th, at 1 and 7 precisely. Admission 50 cents, chil-dren half-price. Don't forget day and date. H.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Frost, Manager."While Sam read, the other boys had been gloatingover the enticing pictures which covered the bill.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　There was the golden car, filled with noble beings inhelmits, all playing on immense trumpets; the twenty-four prancing steeds with manes, tails, and featheredheads tossing in the breeze; the clowns, the tumblers,the strong men, and the riders flying about in the airas if the laws of gravitation no longer existed. But,best of all, was the grand conglomeration of animalswhere the giraffe appears to stand on the elephant'sback, the zebra to be jumping over the seal, the hippopotamusto be lunching off a couple of crocodiles,and lions and tigers to be raining down in all directionswith their mouths, wide open and their tails as stiff asthat of the famous Northumberland House lion.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Cricky! wouldn't I like to see that," said littleCyrus Fay, devoutly hoping that the cage, in whichthis pleasing spectacle took place, was a very strongone.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You never would, it's only a picture! That,now, is something like," and Ben, who had prickedup his ears at the word "circus," laid his finger on asmaller cut of a man hanging by the back of his neckwith a child in each hand, two men suspended fromhis feet, and the third swinging forward to alight onhis head.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I 'm going," said Sam, with calm decision, for thissuperb array of unknown pleasures fired his soul andmade him forget his weight.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"How will you fix it?" asked Ben, fingering thebill with a nervous thrill all through his wiry limbs,just as he used to feel it when his father caught himup to dash into the ring.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Foot it with Billy. It's only four miles, andwe've got lots of time, so we can take it easy. Motherwon't care, if I send word by Cy," answered Sam, producinghalf a dollar, as if such magnificent sums wereno strangers to his pocket.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Come on, Brown; you'll be a first-rate fellow toshow us round, as you know all the dodges," saidBilly, anxious to get his money's worth.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Well, I don't know," began Ben, longing to go,but afraid Mrs. Moss would say "No!" if he askedleave.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"He's afraid," sneered the red-faced boy, who feltbitterly toward all mankind at that instant, becausehe knew there was no hope of his going.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Say that again, and I'll knock your head off,"and Ben faced round with a gesture which caused theother to skip out of reach precipitately.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Hasn't got any money, more likely," observed ashabby youth, whose pockets never had any thing inthem but a pair of dirty hands.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Ben calmly produced a dollar bill and waved itdefiantly before this doubter, observing with dignity:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I've got money enough to treat the whole crowd,if I choose to, which I don't.""Then come along and have a jolly time with Samand me. We can buy some dinner and get a ridehome, as like as not," said the amiable Billy, witha slap on the shoulder, and a cordial grin which madeit impossible for Ben to resist.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"What are you stopping for?" demanded Sam,ready to be off, that they might "take it rasy.""Don't know what to do with Sancho. He'll getlost or stolen if I take him, and it's too far to carryhim home if you are in a hurry," began Ben, persuadinghimself that this was the true reason of his delay.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Let Cy take him back. He'll do it for a cent;won't you, Cy?" proposed Billy, smoothing away allobjections, for he liked Ben, and saw that he wantedto go.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No, I won't; I don't like him. He winks at me,and growls when I touch him," muttered naughty Cy,remembering how much reason poor Sanch had todistrust his tormentor.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"There 's Bab; she'll do it. Come here, sissy;Ben wants you," called Sam, beckoning to a smallfigure just perching on the fence.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Down it jumped and Came fluttering up, muchelated at being summoned by the captain of thesacred nine.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I want you to take Sanch home, and tell yourmother I'm going to walk, and may be won't be backtill sundown. Miss Celia said I Might do what Ipleased, all day. You remember, now."Ben spoke without looking up, and affected to bevery busy buckling a strap into Sanch's collar, for thetwo were so seldom parted that the dog always rebelled.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　It was a mistake on Ben's part, for while his eyeswere on his work Bab's were devouring the bill whichSam still held, and her suspicions were aroused bythe boys' faces.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Where are you going? Ma will want to know,"she said, as curious as a magpie all at once.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Never you mind; girls can't know every thing.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　You just catch hold of this and run along home.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Lock Sanch up for an hour, and tell your mother I'mall right," answered Ben, bound to assert his manlysupremacy before his mates.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"He's going to the circus," whispered Fay, hopingto make mischief.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Circus! Oh, Ben, do take me!" cried Bab,falling into a state of great excitement at the merethought of such delight.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You couldn't walk four miles," began Ben.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Yes, I could, as easy as not.""You haven't got any money.""You have; I saw you showing your dollar, andyou could pay for me, and Ma would pay it back.""Can't wait for you to get ready.""I'll go as I am. I don't care if it is my old hat,"and Bab jerked it on to her head.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Your mother wouldn't like it.""She won't like your going, either.""She isn't my missis now. Miss Celia wouldn'tcare, and I'm going, any way.""Do, do take me, Ben! I'll be just as good asever was, and I'll take care of Sanch all the way,"pleaded Bab, clasping her hands and looking roundfor some sign of relenting in the faces of the boys.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Don't you bother; we don't want any girls taggingafter us," said Sam, walking off to escape theannoyance.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I'll bring you a roll of chickerberry lozengers, ifyou won't tease," whispered kind-hearted Billy, with aconsoling pat on the crown of the shabby straw hat.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"When the circus comes here you shall go, certainsure, and Betty too," said Ben, feeling mean while heproposed what he knew was a hollow mockery.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"They never do come to such little towns; yousaid so, and I think you are very cross, and I won'ttake care of Sanch, so, now!" cried Bab, getting intoa passion, yet ready to cry, she was so disappointed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I Suppose it wouldn't do -- " hinted Billy, with alook from Ben to the little girl, who stood winkinghard to keep the tears back.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Of Course it wouldn't. I'd like to see her walkingeight miles. I don't mind paying for her; it'sgetting her there and back. Girls are such a botherwhen you want to knock round. No, Bab, you can'tgo. Travel right home and don't make a fuss. Comealong, boys; it 's most eleven, and we don't wantto walk fast."Ben spoke very decidedly; and, taking Billy's arm,away they went, leaving poor Bab and Sanch to watchthem out of sight, one sobbing, the other whiningdismally.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Somehow those two figures seemed to go beforeBen all along the pleasant road, and half spoilt hisfun; for though he laughed and talked, cut canes, andseemed as merry as a grig, he could not help feelingthat he ought to have asked leave to go, and beenkinder to Bab.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Perhaps Mrs. Moss would have planned somehowso we could all go, if I'd told her, I'd like to showher round, and she's been real good to me. No usenow. I'll take the girls a lot of candy and makeit all right."He tried to settle it in that way and trudged gaylyoff, hoping Sancho wouldn't feel hurt at being left,wondering if any of "Smithers's lot" would be round,and planning to do the honors handsomely to theboys.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　It was very warm; and just outside of the town theypaused by a wayside watering-trough to wash theirdusty faces, and cool off before plunging into the excitementsof the afternoon. As they stood refreshingthemselves, a baker's cart came jingling by; and Samproposed a hasty lunch while they rested. A supplyof gingerbread was soon bought; and, climbing thegreen bank above, they lay on the grass under a wildcherry-tree, munching luxuriously, while they feastedtheir eyes at the same time on the splendors awaitingthem; for the great tent, with all its flags flying, wasvisible from the hill.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"We'll cut across those fields, -- it 's shorter thangoing by the road, -- and then we can look roundoutside till it's time to go in. I want to have a goodgo at every thing, especially the lions," said Sam, beginningon his last cookie.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I heard 'em roar just now;" and Billy stood upto gaze with big eyes at the flapping canvas which hidthe king of beasts from his longing sight.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"That was a cow mooing. Don't you be a donkey,Bill. When you hear a real roar, you'll shake in yourboots," said Ben, holding up his handkerchief to dry,after it had done double duty as towel and napkin.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I wish you'd hurry up, Sam. Folks are going innow. I see 'em!" and Billy pranced with impatience;for this was his first circus, and he firmlybelieved that he was going to behold all that thepictures promised.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Hold on a minute, while I get one more drink.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Buns are dry fodder," said Sam, rolling over to theedge of the bank and preparing to descend with aslittle trouble as possible.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　He nearly went down head first, however; for, ashe looked before he leaped, he beheld a sight whichcaused him to stare with all his might for an instant,then turn and beckon, saying in an eager whisper,Look here, boys, -- quick!"Ben and Billy peered over, and both suppressed anastonished "Hullo!" for there stood Bab, waiting forSancho to lap his fill out of the overflowing trough.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Such a shabby, tired-looking couple as they were!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Bab with a face as red as a lobster and streaked withtears, shoes white with dust, Playfrock torn at thegathers, something bundled up in her apron, and oneshoe down at the heel as if it hurt her. Sancho lappedeagerly, with his eyes shut; all his ruffles were graywith dust, and his tail hung wearily down, the tasselat half mast, as if in mourning for the master whombe had come to find. Bab still held the strap, intenton keeping her charge safe, though she lost herself;but her courage seemed to be giving out, as shelooked anxiously up and down the road,seeing no signof the three familiar figures she had been following assteadily as a little Indian on the war-trail.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Oh, Sanch, what shall I do if they don't comealong? We must have gone by them somewhere, forI don't see any one that way, and there isn't anyother road to the circus, seems to me."Bab spoke as if the dog could understand andanswer; and Sancho looked as if he did both, for hestopped drinking, pricked up his cars, and, fixing hissharp eyes on the grass above him, gave a suspiciousbark.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It's only squirrels; don't mind, but come alongand be good; for I 'm so tired, I don't know what todo!" sighed Bab, trying to pull him after her as shetrudged on, bound to see the outside of that wonderfultent, even if she never got in.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　But Sancho had heard a soft chirrup; and, with asudden bound, twitched the strap away, sprang up thebank, and landed directly on Ben's back as he laypeeping over. A peal of laughter greeted him; and,having got the better of his master in more ways thanone, he made the most of the advantage by playfullyworrying him as he kept him down, licking his facein spite of his struggles, burrowing in his neck with aticklish nose, snapping at his buttons, and yelpingjoyfully, as if it was the best joke in the world to playhide-and-seek for four long miles.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Before Ben could quiet him, Bab came climbing upthe bank, with such a funny mixture of fear, fatigue,determination, and relief in her dirty little face, thatthe boys could not look awful if they tried.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"How dared you come after us, miss?" demandedSam, as she looked calmly about her, and took a seatbefore she was asked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Sanch would come after Ben; I couldn't makehim go home, so I had to hold on till he was safe here,else he'd be lost, and then Ben would feel bad."The cleverness of that excuse tickled the boys immensely;and Sam tried again, while Ben was gettingthe dog down and sitting on him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Now you expect to go to the circus, I suppose.""Course I do. Ben said he didn't mind paying, ifI could get there without bothering him, and I have;and I'll go home alone. I ain't afraid. Sanch will takecare of me, if you won't," answered Bab, stoutly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"What do you suppose your mother will say toyou?" asked Ben, feeling much reproached by herlast words.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I guess she'll say you led me into mischief;and the sharp child nodded, as if she defied him todeny the truth of that.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You'll catch it when you get home, Ben; so you'dbetter have a good time while you can," advised Sam.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　thinking Bab great fun, since none of the blame ofher pranks would fall on him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"What would you have done if you hadn't found us?" asked Billy, forgetting his impatience in his admirationfor this plucky young lady.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I'd have gone on and seen the circus, and then I'dhave gone home again and told Betty all about it,"was the prompt answer.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"But you haven't any money.""Oh, I'd ask somebody to pay for me. I 'm solittle, it wouldn't be much.""Nobody would do it; so you'd have to stay outside,you see.""No, I wouldn't. I thought of that, and plannedhow I'd fix it if I didn't find Ben. I'd make Sanchdo his tricks, and get a quarter that way; so, now!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　answered Bab, undaunted by any obstacle.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;

 　　"I do believe she would! You are a smart child,Bab; and if I had enough I'd take you in myself,"said Billy, heartily; for, having sisters of his own,he kept a soft place in his heart for girls, especiallyenterprising ones.

 　　"I'll take care of her. It was very naughty tocome, Bab; but, so long as you did, you needn'tworry about any thing. I'll see to you; and youshall have a real good time," said Ben, accepting hisresponsibilities without a murmur, and bound to dothe handsome thing by his persistent friend.

 　　"I thought you would;" and Bab folded her arms,as if she had nothing further to do but enjoy herself.
</div> 
<div>

<div>
 　　"Are you hungry?" asked Billy, fishing out severalfragments of gingerbread.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Starving!" and Bab ate them with such a relishthat Sam added a small contribution; and Bencaught some water for her in his hand, where thelittle spring bubbled up beside a stone.

 　　"Now, you wash your face and spat down yourhair, and put your hat on straight, and then we'llgo," commanded Ben, giving Sanch a roll on thegrass to clean him.

 　　Bab scrubbed her face till it shone; and, pullingdown her apron to wipe it, scattered a load oftreasures collected in her walk. Some of the deadflowers, bits of moss, and green twigs fell near Ben,and one attracted his attention, -- a spray of broad,smooth leaves, with a bunch of whitish berries on it.

<div>

</div> 
<div>
 　　"Where did you get that?" he asked, poking itwith his foot.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"In a swampy place, coming along. Sanch sawsomething down there; and I went with him, 'causeI thought may be it was a musk-rat, and you'd likeone if we could get him.""Was it?" asked the boys all at once, and withintense interest.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No; only a snake, and I don't care for snakes.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　I picked some of that, it was so green and pretty.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Thorny likes queer leaves and berries, you know,"answered Bab, "spatting," down her rough locks.
</div>

 　　"Well, he won't like that, nor you either; it'spoisonous, and I shouldn't wonder if you'd gotpoisoned, Bab. Don't touch it! Swamp-sumach ishorrid stuff, -- Miss Celia said so;" and Ben lookedanxiously at Bab, who felt her chubby face all over,and examined her dingy hands with a solemn air,asking, eagerly, --"Will it break out on me 'fore I get to the circus?""Not for a day or so, I guess; but it's bad whenit does come.""I don't care, if I see the animals first. Comequick, and never mind the old weeds and things,"said Bab, much relieved; for present bliss was allshe had room for now in her happy little heart.
