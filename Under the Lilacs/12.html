The Squire wrote to Mr. Smithersthat the boy had found friends and would staywhere he was. Mrs. Moss consoled him in her motherlyway, and the little girls did their very best to "begood to poor Benny." But Miss Celia was his truestcomforter, and completely won his heart, not only bythe friendly words she said and the pleasant things shedid, but by the unspoken sympathy which showed itselfjust at the right minute, in a look, a touch, a smile,more helpful than any amount of condolence. Shecalled him "my man," and Ben tried to be one, bearinghis trouble so bravely that she respected him. althoughhe was only a little boy, because it promised well forthe future.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Then she was so happy herself, it was impossible forthose about her to be sad, and Ben soon grew cheerfulagain in spite of the very tender memory of his fatherlaid quietly away in the safest corner of his heart. Hewould have been a very unboyish boy if he had not beenhappy, for the new place was such a pleasant one, hesoon felt as if, for the first time, he really had a home.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　No more grubbing now, but daily tasks which nevergrew tiresome, they were so varied and so light. Nomore cross Pats to try his temper, but the sweetestmistress that ever was, since praise was oftener on herlips than blame, and gratitude made willing service adelight.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　At first, it seemed as if there was going to be troublebetween the two boys; for Thorny was naturally masterful,and illness had left him weak and nervous, so hewas often both domineering and petulant. Ben hadbeen taught instant obedience to those older than himself, and if Thorny had been a man Ben would havemade no complaint; but it was hard to be "orderedround" by a boy, and an unreasonable one into thebargain.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　A word from Miss Celia blew away the threateningcloud, however; and for her sake her brother promisedto try to be patient; for her sake Ben declared he neverwould "get mad" if Mr. Thorny did fidget; and bothvery soon forgot all about master and man and livedtogether like two friendly lads, taking each other's upsand downs good-naturedly, and finding mutual pleasureand profit in the new companionship.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The only point on which they never could agree waslegs, and many a hearty laugh did they give Miss Celiaby their warm and serious discussion of this vexed question.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Thorny insisted that Ben was bow1egged; Benresented the epithet, and declared that the legs of allgood horsemen must have a slight curve, and any onewho knew any thing about the matter would acknowledgeboth its necessity and its beauty. Then ThornyWould observe that it might be all very well in the saddle,but it made a man waddle like a duck when afoot;whereat Ben would retort that, for his part, he wouldrather waddle like a duck than tumble about like ahorse with the staggers. He had his opponent there,for poor Thorny did look very like a weak-kneed coltwhen he tried to walk; but he would never own it, andcame down upon Ben with crushing allusions to centaurs,or the Greeks and Romans, who were famous bothfor their horsemanship and fine limbs. Ben could notanswer that, except by proudly referring to the chariot-races copied from the ancients, in which he had bornea part, which was more than somefolks with long legscould say. Gentlemen never did that sort of thing,nor did they twit their best friends with their misfortunes,Thorny would remark; casting a pensive glanceat his thin hands, longing the while to give Ben a goodshaking. This hint would remind the other of hisyoung master's late sufferings and all he owed his dearmistress; and he usually ended the controversy byturning a few lively somersaults as a vent for his swellingwrath, and come up with his temper all right again.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Or, if Thorny happened to be in the wheeled chair, hewould trot him round the garden at a pace which nearlytook his breath away, thereby proving that if "bow-legs" were not beautiful to some benighted beings theywere "good to go."Thorny liked that, and would drop the subject forthe time by politely introducing some more agreeabletopic; so the impending quarrel would end in alaugh over some boyish joke, and the word "legsbe avoided by mutual consent till accident broughtit up again.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The spirit of rivalry is hidden in the best of us, andis a helpful and inspiring power if we know how to useit. Miss Celia knew this, and tried to make the ladshelp one another by means of it, -- not in boastful orungenerous comparison of each other's gifts, but byinterchanging them, giving and taking freely, kindly,and being glad to love what was admirable whereverthey found it. Thorny admired Ben's strength, activ-ity, and independence; Ben envied Thorny's learning,good manners, and comfortable surroundings; and,when a wise word had set the matter rightly beforethem, both enjoyed the feeling that there was a certainequality between them, since money could not buyhealth, and practical knowledge was as useful as anythat can be found in books. So they interchangedtheir small experiences, accomplishments, and pleasures,and both were the better, as well as the happier,for it; because in this way only can we truly love ourneighbor as ourself, and get the real sweetness out oflife.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　There was no end to the new and pleasant thingsBen had to do, from keeping paths and flower-bedsneat, feeding the pets, and running errands, to waitingon Thorny and being right-hand man to Miss Celia.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　He had a little room in the old house, newly paperedwith hunting scenes, which he was never tired of admiring.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　In the closet hung several out-grown suitsof Thorny's, made over for his valet; and, what Benvalued infinitely more, a pair of boots, well blackedand ready for grand occasions, when he rode abroad,with one old spur, found in the attic, brightened upand merely worn for show, since nothing would haveinduced him to prick beloved Lita with it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Many pictures, cut from illustrated papers, of races,animals, and birds, were stuck round the room, givingit rather the air of a circus and menagerie. This, however,made it only the more home-like to its presentowner, who felt exceedingly rich and respectable as hesurveyed his premises; almost like a retired showmanwho still fondly remembers past successes, though nowhappy in the more private walks of life.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　In one drawer of the quaint little bureau which heused, were kept the relics of his father; very few andpoor, and of no interest to any one but himself, --only the letter telling of his death, a worn-out watch-chain,and a photograph of Senor Jose Montebello,with his youthful son standing on his head, both airilyattired, and both smiling with the calmly superior expressionwhich gentlemen of their profession usuallywear in public. Ben's other treasures had been stolenwith his bundle; but these he cherished and oftenlooked at when he went to bed, wondering whatheaven was like, since it was lovelier than California,and usually fell asleep with a dreamy impression thatit must be something like America when Columbusfound it, -- "a pleasant land, where were gay flowersand tall trees, with leaves and fruit such as they hadnever seen before." And through this happy hunt-ing-ground"father" was for ever riding on a beautiful white horsewith wings, like the one of which MissCelia had a picture.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Nice times Ben had in his little room poring overhis books, for he soon had several of his own; buthis favorites were Hamerton's "Animals" and "OurDumb Friends," both full of interesting pictures andanecdotes such as boys love. Still nicer times workingabout the house, helping get things in order; andbest of all were the daily drives with Miss Celia andThorny, when weather permitted, or solitary rides totown through the heaviest rain, for certain lettersmust go and come, no matter how the elements raged.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The neighbors soon got used to the "antics of thatboy," but Ben knew that he was an object of interestas he careered down the main street in a way thatmade old ladies cry out and brought people flying tothe window, sure that some one was being run awaywith. Lita enjoyed the fun as much as he, and apparentlydid her best to send him heels over head, having rapidlyearned to understand the signs he gaveher by the touch of hand and foot, or the tones ofhis voice.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　These performances caused the boys to regard BenBrown with intense admiration, the girls with timidawe, all but Bab, who burned to imitate him, and triedher best whenever she got a chance, much to the anguishand dismay of poor Jack, for that long-sufferinganimal was the only steed she was allowed to ride.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Fortunately, neither she nor Betty had much time forplay just now, as school was about to close for thelong vacation, and all the little people were busyfinishing up, that they might go to play with freeminds. So the "lilac-parties," as they called them,were deferred till later, and the lads amused themselvesin their own way, with Miss Celia to suggestand advise.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　It took Thorny a long time to arrange his possessions,for he could only direct while Ben unpacked,wondering and adiniring as he worked, because he hadnever seen so many boyish treasures before. Thelitte printing-press was his especial delight, and leavingevery thing else in confusion, Thorny taught himits and planned a newspaper on the spot, with Benfor printer, himself for editor, and "Sister" for chiefcontributor, while Bab should be carrier and Bettyoffice-boy. Next came a postage-stamp book, and arainy day was happily spent in pasting a new collectionwhere each particular one belonged, with copiousexplanations from Thorny as they went along. Bendid not feel any great interest in this amusement afterone trial of it, but when a book containing patternsof the flags of all nations turned up, he was seizedwith a desire to copy them all, so that the housecould be fitly decorated on gala occasions. Findingthat it amused her brother, Miss Celia generouslyopened her piece-drawer and rag-bag, and as themania grew till her resources were exhausted, shebought bits of gay cambric and many-colured papers,and startled the store-keeper by purchasing severalbottles of mucilage at once. Bab and Betty wereinvited to sew the bright strips of stars, and prickedtheir little fingers assiduously, finding this sort ofneedle-work much more attractive than piecing bed-quilts.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Such a snipping and pasting, planning and stitchingas went on in the big back room, which was givenup to them, and such a noble array of banners andpetitions as soon decorated its walls, would havecaused the dullest eye to brighten with amusement,if not with admiration. Of course, the Stars andStripes hung highest, with the English lion rampingon the royal standard close by; then followed a regularpicture-gallery, for there was the white elephant ofSiam, the splendid peacock of Burmah, the double-headed Russian eagle, and black dragon of China,the winged lion of Venice, and the prancing pair onthe red, white, and blue flag of Holland. The keysand mitre of the Papal States were a hard job, but upthey went at last, with the yellow crescent of Turkeyon one side and the red full moon of Japan on theother; the pretty blue and white flag of Greece hungbelow and the cross of free Switzerland above. Ifmaterials had held out, the flags of all the UnitedStates would have followed; but paste and patiencewere exhausted, so the busy workers rested awhilebefore they "flung their banner to the breeze," asthe newspapers have it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　A spell of ship-building and rigging followed theflag fit; for Thorny, feeling too old now for suchtoys, made over his whole fleet to "the children,"condescending, however, to superintend a thoroughrepairing of the sa,e before he disposed of all butthe big man-of-war, which continued to ornament hisown room, with all sail set and a little red officerperpetually waving his sword on the quarter-deck.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　These gifts led to out-of-door water-works, for thebrook had to be dammed up, that a shallow oceanmight be made, where Ben's piratical "Red Rover,"with the black flag, might chase and capture Bab'ssmart frigate, "Queen," while the "Bounding Betsey,"laden with lumber, safely sailed from Kennebunkport toMassachusetts Bay. Thorny, from hischair, was chief-engineer, and directed his gang ofone how to dig the basin, throw up the embankment,and finally let in the water till the mimic ocean wasfull; then regulate the little watrr-gate, lest it shouldoverflow and wreck the pretty squadron or ships, boats,canoes, and rafts, which soon rode at anchor there.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Digging and paddling in mud and water provedsuch a delightful pastime that the boys kept it up, tilla series of water-wheels, little mills and cataractsmade the once quiet brook look as if a manufacturingtown was about to spring up where hitheto minnows hadplayed in peace and the retiring frog hadchanted his serenade unmolested.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Miss Celia liked all this, for any thing which wouldkeep Thorny happy out-of-doors in the sweet Juneweather found favor in her eyes, and when the noveltyhad worn off from home affairs, she planned a seriesof exploring expeditions which filled their boyish soulswith delight. As none of them knew much about theplace, it really was quite exciting to start off on abright morning with a roll of wraps and cushions,lunch, books, and drawing materials packed into thephaeton, and drive at random about the shady roadsand lanes, pausing when and where they liked. Wonderfuldiscoveries were made, pretty places werenamed, plans were drawn, and all sorts of mrrryadventures befell the pilgrims.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Each day they camped in a new spot, and while Litanibbled the fresh grass at her ease, Miss Celia sketchedunder the big umbrella, Thorny read or lounged orslept on his rubber blanket, and Ben made himselfgenerally useful. Unloading, filling the artist's water-bottle, piling the invalid's cushions, setting out thelunch, running to and fro for a Bower or a butterfly,climbing a tree to report the view, reading, chatting, orfrolicking with Sancho,-- any sort of duty was inBen's line, and he did them all well, for an out-of-doorlife was natural to him and he liked it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Ben, I want an amanuensis," said Thorny, droppingbook and pencil one day after a brief interval ofsilence, broken only by the whisper of the youngleaves overhead and the soft babble of the brookclose by.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"A what?" asked Ben, pushing back his hat withsuch an air of amazement that Thorny rather loftilyinquired:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Don't you know what an amanuensis is?""Well, no; not unless it's some relation to an anaconda.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Shouldn't think you'd want one of them, anyway."Thorny rolled over with a hoot of derision, and hissister, who sat close by, sketching an old gate, lookedup to see what was going on.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Well, you needn't laugh at a feller. You didn'tknow what a wombat was when I asked you, and Ididn't roar," said Ben, giving his hat a slap, as nothingelse was handy.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"The idea of wanting an anaconda tickled me so, Icouldn't help it. I dare say you'd have got me oneif I had asked for it, you are such an obliging chap,""Of course I would if I could. Shouldn't be surprisedif you did some day, you want such funnythings," answered Ben, appeased by the compliment.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I'll try the amanuensis first. It's only some oneto write for me; I get so tired doing it without a table.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　You write well enough, and it will be good for you toknow something about botany. I intend to teach you,Ben," said Thorny, as if conferring a great favor.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It looks pretty hard," muttered Ben, with a dolefulGlance at the book laid open upon a strew of tornleaves and flowers.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No, it isn't; it's regularly jolly; and you'd be noend of a help if you only knew a little. Now, supposeI say, 'Bring me a "ranunculus bulbosus,"' howwould yoy know what I wanted?" demanded Thorny,waving his microscope with a learned air.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Shouldn't.""There are quantities of them all round us; and Iwant to analyze one. See if you can't guess."Ben stared vaguely from earth to sky, and was aboutto give it up, when a buttercup fell at his feet, and hecaught sight of Miss Celia smiling at him from behindher brother, who did not see the flower.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"S'pose you mean this? I don't call 'em rhinocerusbulburses, so I wasn't sure." And, taking the hint asquickly as it was given, Ben presented the buttercupas if he knew all about it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You guessed that remarkably well. Now bringme a 'leontodon taraxacum,'" said Thorny, charmedwith the quickness of his pupil, and glad to display hislearning.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Again Ben gazed, but the field was full of earlyflowers; and, if a long pencil had not pointed to adandelion close by, he would have been lost.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Here you are, sir," he answered with a chuckleand Thorny took his turn at being astonished now.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"How the dickens did you know that?""Try it again, and may be you'll find out," laughedBen.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Diving hap-hazard into his book, Thorny demandeda "trifolium pratense."The clever pencil pointed, and Ben brought a redclover, mightily enjoying the joke, and thinking thattheir kind of botany wasn't bad fun.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Look here, no fooling!" and Thorny sat up to investigatethe matter, so quickly that his sister had nottime to sober down. "Ah, I've caught you! Notfair to tell, Celia. Now, Ben, you've got to learn allabout this buttercup, to pay for cheating.""Werry good, sir; bring on your rhinoceriouses,"answered Ben, who couldn't help imitating his oldfriend the clown when he felt particularly jolly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Sit there and write what I tell you," orderedThorny, with all the severity of a strict schoolmaster.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Perching himself on the mossy stump, Ben obedientlyfloundered through the following analysis, withconstant help in the spelling, and much private wonderwhat would come of it: --"Phaenogamous. Exogenous. Angiosperm. Polypetalous.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Stamens, more than ten. Stamens on thereceptacle. Pistils, more than one and separate.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Leaves without stipules. Crowfoot family. Genusranunculus. Botanical name, Ranunculus bulbosus.""Jerusalem! what a flower! Pistols and crows'
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　feet, and Polly put the kettles on, and Angy spermsand all the rest of 'em! If that's your botany, Iwon't take any more, thank you," said Ben, as hepaused as hot and red as if he had been running arace.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Yes, you Will; you'll learn that all by heart, andthen I shall give you a dandelion to do. You'll likethat, because it means dent de lion, or lion's tooth;and I'll show them to you through my glass. You'veno idea how interesting it is, and what heaps of prettythings you'll see," answered Thorny, who had alreadydiscovered how charming the study was, and hadfound great satisfaction in it, since he had beenforbidden more active pleasures.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"What's the good of it, anyway?" asked Ben, whowould rather have been set to mowing the big fieldthan to the task before him.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It tells all about it in my book here, -- 'Gray'sBotany for Young People.' But I can tell you whatuse it is to us," continued Thorny, crossing his legs inthe air and preparing to argue the matter, comfortablylying flat on his back. "We are a Scientific ExplorationSociety, and we must keep an account of allthe plants, animals, minerals, and so on, as we comeacross them. Then, suppose we get lost, and haveto hunt for food, how are we to know what is safeand what isn't? Come, now, do you know thedifference between a toadstool and a mushroom?""No, I don't.""Then I'll teach you some day. There is sweetflag and poisonous flag, and all sorts of berries andthings; and you'd better look out when you arein the woods, or you'll touch ivy and dogwood,and have a horrid time, if you don't know yourbotany.""Thorny learned much of his by sad experience;and you will be wise to take his advice," said MissCelia, recalling her brother's various mishaps beforethe new fancy came on.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Didn't I have a time of it, though, when I had togo round for a week with plantain leaves and creamstuck all over my face! Just picked some pretty reddogwood, Ben; and then I was a regular guy, with aface like a lobster, and my eyes swelled out of sight.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Come along, and learn right away, and never get intoscrapes like most fellows."Impressed by this warning, and attracted byThorny's enthusiasm, Ben cast himself down uponthe blanket, and for an hour the two heads bobbedto and fro, from microscope to book, the teacherairing his small knowledge, the pupil more and moreinterested in the new and curious things he saw orheard, -- though it must be confessed that Ben infinitelyprefered to watch ants and bugs, queer littleworms and gauzy-winged flies, rather than "putter"over plants with long names. He did not dare tosay so, however; but, when Thorny asked him if itwasn't capital fun, he dodged cleverly by proposingto hunt up the flowers for his master to gtudy, offeringto learn about the dangerous ones, but pleadingwant of time to investigate this pleasing science verydeeply.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　As Thorny had talked himself hoarse, he was veryready to dismiss his class of one to fish the milk-bottle out of the brook; and recess was prolongedtill next day. But both boys found a new pleasurein the pretty pastime they made of it; for active Benranged the woods and fields with a tin box slung overhis shoulder, and feeble Thorny had a little roomfitted up for his own use, where he pressed flowersin newspaper books, dried herbs on the walls, hadbottles and cups, pans and platters, for his treasures,and made as much litter as he liked.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Presently, Ben brought such lively accounts of thegreen nooks where jacks-in-the-pulpit preached theirlittle sermons; brooks, beside which grew blue violetsand lovely ferns; rocks, round which danced thecolumbines like rosy elves, or the trees where birdsbuilt, squirrels chattered, and woodchucks burrowed,that Thorny was seized with a desire to go and seethese beauties for himself. So Jack was saddled, andwent plodding, scrambling, and wandering into allmanner of pleasant places, always bringing home astronger, browner rider than he carried away.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　This delighted Miss Celia; and she gladly sawthem ramble off together, leaving her time to stitchhappily at certain dainty bits of sewing, write voluminonsletters, or dream over others quite as long,swinging in her hammock under the lilacs.
