An irruptionof bunting seemied to have broken out all over theold house, for banners of every shape and size, colorand design, flew from chimney-top to gable, porchand gate-way, making the quiet place look as livelyas a circus tent, which was just what Ben most desiredand delighted in.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The boys had been up very early to prepare theshow, and when it was ready enjoyed it hugely, forthe fresh wind made the pennons cut strange capers.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The winged lion of Venice looked as if trying to flyaway home; the Chinese dragon appeared to brandishhis forked tail as he clawed at the Burmese peacock;the double-headed eagle of Russia pecked at theTurkish crescent with one beak, while the otherseemed to be screaming to the English royal beast,"Come on and lend a paw." In the hurry of hoistingthe Siamese elephant got turned upside down,and now danced gayly on his head, with the stars andstripes waving proudly over him. A green flag witha yellow harp and sprig of shamrock hung in sight ofthe kitchen window, and Katy, the cook, got breakfastto the tune of "St. Patrick's day in the morning."Sancho's kennel was half hidden under a rustlingpaper imitation of the gorgeous Spanish banner, andthe scarlet sun-and-moon flag of Arabia snapped andflaunted from the pole over the coach-house, as adelicate compliment to Lita, Arabian horses beingconsidered the finest in the world.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The little girls came out to see, and declared it wasthe loveliest sight they ever beheld, while Thornyplayed "Hail Columbia" on his fife, and Ben, mountingthe gate-post, crowed long and loud like a happycockerel who had just reached his majority. He hadbeen surprised and delighted with the gifts he foundin his room on awaking and guessed why Miss Celiaand Thorny gave him such pretty things, for amongthem was a match-box made like a mouse-trap. Thedoggy buttons and the horsey whip were treasures,indeed, for Miss Celia had not given them when theyfirst planned to do so, because Sancho's return seemedto be joy and reward enough for that occasion. Buthe did not forget to thank Mrs. Moss for the cake shesent him, nor the girls for the red mittens which theyhad secretly and painfully knit. Bab's was long andthin, with a very pointed thumb, Betty's short andwide, with a stubby thumb, and all their mother'spulling and pressing could not make them look alike,to the great affliction of the little knitters. Ben,however, assured them that he rather preferred odd ones,as then he could always tell which was right andwhich left. He put them on immediately and wentabout cracking the new whip with an expression ofcontent which was droll to see, while the childrenfollowed after, full of admiration for the hero of theday.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　They were very busy all the morning preparing forthe festivities to come, and as soon as dinner was overevery one scrambled into his or her best clothes asfast as possible, because, although invited to come attwo, impatient boys and girls were seen hoveringabout the avenue as early as one.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　The first to arrive, however, was an uninvitedguest, for just as Bab and Betty sat down on theporch steps, in their stiff pink calico frocks and whiteruffled aprons, to repose a moment before the partycame in, a rustling was heard among the lilacs, andout stepped Alfred Tennyson Barlow, looking like asmall Robin Hood, in a green blouse with a silverbuckle on his broad belt, a feather in his little capand a bow in his hand.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I have come to shoot. I heard about it. Mypapa told me what arching meant. Will there beany little cakes? I like them."With these opening remarks the poet took a seatand calmly awaited a response. The young ladies,I regret to say, giggled, then remembering theiimanners, hastened to inform him that there would beheaps of cakes, also that Miss Celia would not mindhis coming without an invitation, they were quite sure.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"She asked me to come that day. I have beenvery busy. I had measles. Do you have themhere?" asked the guest, as if anxious to comparenotes on the sad subject.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"We had ours ever so long ago. What have youbeen doing besides having measles?" said Betty,showing a polite interest.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I had a fight with a bumble-bee.""Who beat?" demanded Bab.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I did. I ran away and he couldn't catch me.""Can you shoot nicely?
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I hit a cow. She did not mind at all. I guessshe thought it was a fly.""Did your mother know you were coming?" askedBab, feeling an interest in runaways.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No; she is gone to drive, so I could not askher.""It is very wrong to disobey. My Sunday-schoolbook says that children who are naughty that waynever go to heaven," observed virtuous Betty, in awarning tone.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I do not wish to go," was the startling reply.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Why not?" asked Betty, severely.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"They don't have any dirt there. My mammasays so. I am fond of dirt. I shall stay here wherethere is plenty of it," and the candid youth began togrub in the mould with the satisfaction of a genuineboy.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I am afraid you're a very bad child.""Oh yes, I am. My papa often says so and he knowsall about it," replied Alfred with an involuntarywriggle suggestive of painful memories. Then,as if anxious to change the conversation from itssomewhat personal channel, he asked, pointing to arow of grinning heads above the wall, "Do you shootat those?"Bab and Betty looked up quickly and recognizedthe familiar faces of their friends peering down atthem, like a choice collection of trophies or targets.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I should think you'd be ashamed to peek beforethe party was ready!" cried Bab, frowning darklyupon the merry young ladies.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Miss Celia told us to come before two, and beready to receive folks, if she wasn't down," addedBetty, importantly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"It is striking two now. Come along, girls;" andover scrambled Sally Folsom, fo11owed by three orfour kindred spirits, just as their hostess appeared.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You look like Amazons storming a fort," shesaid, as the girls cattle up, each carrying her bow andarrows, while green ribbons flew in every direction.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"How do you do, sir? I have been hoping youwould call again," added Miss Celia, shaking handswith the pretty boy, who regarded with benigninterest the giver of little cakes.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Here a rush of boys took place, and further remarkswere cut short, for every one was in a hurry tobegin. So the procession was formed at once, MissCelia taking the lead, escorted by Ben in the post ofhonor, while the boys and girls paired off behind,arm in arm, bow on Shoulder, in martial array.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Thorny and Billy were the band, and marched before,fifing and drumming "Yankee Doodle" with avigor which kept feet moving briskly, made eyessparkle, and young hearts dance under the gaygowns and summer jackets. The interesting strangerwas elected to bear the prize, laid out on a red pin-cushion; and did so with great dignity, as he wentbeside the standard bearer, Cy Fay, who bore Ben'schoicest flag, snow-white, with a green wreathsurrounding a painted bow and arrow, and with theletters W. T. C. done in red below.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Such a merry march all about the place, out at theLodge gate, up and down the avenue, along the windingpaths, till they halted in the orchard, where thetarget stood, and seats were placed for the archerswhile they waited for their turns. Various rules andregulations were discussed, and then the fun began.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Miss Celia had insisted that the girls should beinvited to shoot with the boys; and the lads consentedwithout much concern, whispering to one another withcondescending shrugs, "Let 'em try, if th@y like; theycan't do any thing."There were various trials of skill before the greatmatch came off, and in these trials the young gentlemendiscovered that two at least of the girls could dosomething; for Bab and Sally shot better than manyof the boys, and were well rewarded for their exertionsby, the change which took place in the faces andconversation of their mates.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Why, Bab, you do as well as if I'd taught youmyself," said Thorny, much surprised and notaltogether pleased at the little girl's skill.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"A lady taught me; and I mean to beat every oneof you," answered Bab, saucily, while her sparklingeyes turned to Miss Celia with a mischievoustwinkle in them.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Not a bit of it," declared Thorny, stoutly; but hewent to Ben and whispered, "Do your best, oldfellow, for sister has taught Bab all the scientificpoints, and the little rascal is ahead of Billy.""She won't get ahead of me," said Ben, pickingout his best arrow, and trying the string of his bowwith a confident air which re-assured Thorny, whofound it impossible to believe that a girl ever could,would, or should excel a boy in any thing he caredto try.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　It really did look as if Bab would beat when thematch for the prize came off; and the children gotmore and more excited as the six who were to tryfor it took turns at the bull's-eye. Thorny wasumpire, and kept account of each shot, for the arrowwhich went nearest the middle would win. Eachhad three shots; and very soon the lookers-on sawthat Ben and Bab were the best marksmen, and oneof them would surely get the silver arrow.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Sam, who was too lazy to practise, soon gave upthe contest, saying, as Thorny did, "It wouldn't befair for such a big fellow to try with the little chaps,"which made a laugh, as his want of skill was painfullyevident. But Mose went at it gallantly; and, if hiseye had been as true as his arms were strong, the"little chaps" would have trembled. But his shotswere none of them as near as Billy's; and he retiredafter the third failure, declaring that it was impossibleto shoot against the wind, though scarcely a breathwas stirring.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Sally Folsom was bound to beat Bab, and twangedaway in great style; all in vain, however, as with tallMaria Newcomb, the third girl who attempted the trial.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Being a little near-sighted, she had borrowed hersister's eye-glasses, and thereby lessened her chanceof success; for the pinch on her nose distracted herattention, and not one of her arrows went beyondthe second ring to her great disappointment. Billydid very well, but got nervous when his last shotcame, and just missed the bull's-eye by being in ahurry.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Bab and Ben each had one turn more; and, asthey were about even, that last arrow would decidrthe victory. Both had sent a shot into the bull's-eye,but neither was exactly in the middle; so there wasroom to do better, even, and the children crowdedround, crying eagerly, "Now, Ben!" "Now, Bab!""Hit her up, Ben!" "Beat him, Bab!" whileThorny looked as anxious as if the fate of the countrydepended on the success of his man. Bab's turncame first; and, as Miss Celia examined her bow tosee that all was right, the little girl said, With hereyes on her rival's excited face, --"I want to beat, but Ben will feel so bad, I 'mosthope I sha'n't.""Losing a prize sometimes makes one happier thangaining it. You have proved that you could do betterthan most of them; so, if you do not beat, you maystill feet proud," answered Miss Celia, giving back thebow with a smile that said more than her words.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　It seemed to give Bab a new idea, for in a minuteall sorts of recollections, wishes, and plans rushedthrough her lively little mind, and she followed asudden generous impulse as blindly as she oftendid a wilful one.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I guess he'll beat," she said, softly, with a quicksparkle of the eyes, as she stepped to her place andfired without taking her usual careful aim.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Her shot struck almost as near the centre on theright as her last one had hit on the left; and therewas a shout of delight from the girls as Thornyannounced it before he hurried back to Ben, whisperinganxiously, --"Steady, old Man, steady; you must beat that, orwe shall never hear the last of it."Ben did not say, "She won't get ahead of me," ashe had said at the first; he set his teeth, threw offhis hat, and, knitting his brows with a resoluteexpression, prepared to take steady aim, though hisheart beat fast and his thumb trembled as he pressedit on the bowstring.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I hope you'll beat, I truly do," said Bab, at hiselbow; and, as if the breath that framed the generouswish helped it on its way, the arrow flew straightto the bull's-eye, hitting, apparently, the very spotwhere Bab's best shot had left a hole.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"A tie! a tie!" cried the girls, as a general rushtook place toward the target.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"No, Ben's is nearest. Ben's beat! Hoorayshouted the boys, throwing up their hats.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　There was only a hair's-breadth difference, andBab could honestly have disputed the decision; butshe did not, though for an instant she could nothelp wishing that the cry had been "Bab's beat!
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Hurrah! " it sounded so pleasant. Then she sawBen's beaming face, Thorny's intense relief, andcaught the look Miss Celia sent her over the headsof the boys, and decided, with a sudden warm glowall over her little face, that losing a prize didsometimes make one happier than winning it. Up wenther best hat, and she burst out in a shrill, "Rah,rah, rah!" that sounded very funny coming all aloneafter the general clamor had subsided.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Good for you, Bab! you are an honor to theclub. and I'm proud of you", said Prince Thorny,with a hearty handshake; for, as his man had won,he could afford to praise the rival who had put himon his mettle, though she was a girl.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Bab was much uplifted by the royal commendation,but a few minutes later felt pleased as well as proudwhen Ben, having received the prize, came to her, asshe stood behind a tree sucking her blistered thumb,while Betty braided up her dishevelled locks.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"I think it would be fairer to call it a tie, Bab, forit really was, and I want you to wear this. I wantedthe fun of beating, but I don't care a bit for this girl'sthing and I'd rather see it on you."As he spoke, Ben offered the rosette of greenribbon which held the silver arrow, and Bab's eyesbrightened as they fell upon the pretty ornament,for to her "the girl's thing" was almost as good asthe victory.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Oh no; you must wear it to show who won.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Miss Celia wouldn't like it. I don't mind not gettingit; I did better than all the rest, and I guess Ishouldn't like to beat you," answered Bab, unconsciouslyputting into childish words the sweet generosity whichmakes so many sisters glad to see theirbrothers carry off the prizes of life, while they arecontent to know that they have earned them and cando without the praise.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　But if Bab was generous, Ben was just; andthough he could not explain the feeling, would notconsent to take all the glory without giving his littlefriend a share.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"You must wear it; I shall feel real mean if youdon't. You worked harder than I did, and it wasonly luck my getting this. Do, Bab, to please me,"he persisted, awkwardly trying to fasten the ornamentin the middle of Bab's' white apron.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Then I will. Now do you forgive me for losingSancho?" asked Bab, with a wistful look whichmade Ben say, heartily, --"I did that when he came home.""And you don't think I'm horrid?""Not a bit of it; you are first-rate, and I'll standby you like a man, for you are 'most as good as aboy!" cried Ben, anxious to deal handsomely with hisfeminine rival, whose skill had raised her immenselyin his opinion.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　Feeling that he could not improve that last compliment,Bab was fully satisfied, and let him leave theprize upon her breast, conscious that she had someclaim to it.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"That is where it should be, and Ben is a trueknight, winning the prize that he may give it to hislady, while he is content with the victory," said MissCelia, laughingly, to Teacher, as the children ran offto join in the riotous games which soon made theorchard ring.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"He learned that at the circus 'tunnyments,' ashe calls them. He is a nice boy, and I am muchinterested in him; for he has the two things that domost toward making a man, patience and courage,"answered Teacher, also as she watched theyoung knight play and the honored ladytearing about in a game of tag.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 　　"Bab is a nice child, too," said Miss Celia; "sheis as quick as a flash to catch an idea and carry itout, though very often the ideas are wild ones. Shecould have won just now, I fancy, if she had tried,but took the notion into her head that it was noblerto let Ben win, and so atone for the trouble she gavehim in losing the dog. I saw a very sweet look onher face just now, and am sure that Ben will neverknow why he beat.""She does such things at school sometimes, and Ican't bear to spoil her little atonements, though theyare not always needed or very wise," answeredTeacher. "Not long ago I found that she had beengiving her lunch day after day to a poor child whoseldom had any, and when I asked her why, she said,with tears, 'I used to laugh at Abby, because she hadonly crusty, dry bread, and so she wouldn't bringany. I ought to give her mine and be hungry, it wasso mean to make fun of her poorness.""Did you stop the sacrifice?""No; I let Bab 'go halves,' and added an extrabit to my own lunch, so I could make my contributionlikewise.""Come and tell me about Abby. I want to makefriends with our poor people, for soon I shall have aright to help them;" and, putting her arm in Teacher's,Miss Celia led her away for a quiet chat in the porch,making her guest's visit a happy holiday by confidingseveral plans and asking advice in the friendliest way.
