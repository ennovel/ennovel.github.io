<p>"There may have been something about it in yesterday's paper," he said to himself. "I must go to the office of publication and buy a copy."</p> 
<p>It occurred to him, however, that there might be an advertisement offering a reward for its recovery, and he began to search, with this object in view.</p> 
<p>Presently his eye lighted on the following:</p> 
<p>"Two Hundred and Fifty Dollars Reward.</p> 
<p>"On the fifteenth instant, a Tin Box, containing a considerable sum in Five-Twenty Government and Union Pacific Bonds, was stolen from the office of the subscriber. The above sum will be paid for the discovery of the thief, or for information leading to the recovery of all, or the larger part, of the bonds. JAMES P. WHEELER,</p> 
<p>"No. 265 Broadway, Room 10."</p> 
<p>I do not claim to have given the correct number, for obvious reasons. Of course, the address given in the advertisement was accurate.</p> 
<p>Naturally, Harry was much pleased at his easy success. He had only to go to the office mentioned and communicate what he knew, and leave Mr. Wheeler to take the necessary steps for the recovery of the property.</p> 
<p>Should he attend first to that, or to the sale of the coupons? On the whole, he decided to go to Mr. Wheeler's office first, as the tin box might be removed at any time, if the suspicions of Vernon or Temple should be excited.</p> 
<p>It was, of course, perfectly easy to find any address on Broadway, and not many minutes elapsed before Harry found himself before the door of office No. 10.</p> 
<p>Entering--for the door was ajar--he saw a large, handsomely fitted-up office, with a small room partitioned off at one corner.</p> 
<p>In this room sat a man of middle age, with a keen face and a brisk air, which indicated that he was a trained man of business.</p> 
<p>Outside, at a desk, sat a young man, evidently a clerk, who was busily engaged in writing. It was he who looked up when Harry entered and looked hesitatingly about.</p> 
<p>"Well, Johnny, what can I do for you?" said the young man, patronizingly.</p> 
<p>"Is Mr. Wheeler in the office?"</p> 
<p>"Yes; but he is busy."</p> 
<p>"He will see me," said Harry, with quiet confidence.</p> 
<p>"Will he?" asked the young man, surveying our hero with some curiosity. "Who do you come from?"</p> 
<p>"From no one. I have business of my own with Mr. Wheeler."</p> 
<p>"Who is it?" asked an imperative voice.</p> 
<p>"A boy to see you, sir," answered the clerk, respectfully.</p> 
<p>"Bring him in, then, and don't waste his time and your own in unnecessary talk."</p> 
<p>"Waste his time, indeed," muttered the clerk, who evidently did not regard Harry's time as particularly valuable.</p> 
<p>"Well, young man," said the lawyer--for such was his business--as Harry entered his presence. "What is it?"</p> 
<p>"I should like a private interview, sir," said Harry, glancing at the clerk, who was hovering near.</p> 
<p>"Shut the door, and resume your writing, Richard," said Mr. Wheeler.</p> 
<p>Shrugging his shoulders, with a disappointed look, Richard obeyed.</p> 
<p>"I came to see you about the advertisement," said Harry, coming to the point at once.</p> 
<p>The lawyer started, and eyed Harry keenly. Could the boy be one of the thieves, or was he merely acting as a go-between?</p> 
<p>"Do you know anything about the box of bonds?" asked Mr. Wheeler, quickly.</p> 
<p>"Yes, sir; I know where it is concealed."</p> 
<p>"Ha, that is important. Do you come from the parties that took them?"</p> 
<p>Harry colored, and looked indignant.</p> 
<p>"No, sir," he answered, with emphasis.</p> 
<p>Mr. Wheeler smiled.</p> 
<p>"I was bringing no charge against you," he said. "I thought the guilty parties might have employed you as their agent--their innocent agent. Now, tell me how you come to know anything about the matter."</p> 
<p>This Harry proceeded to do. As the story is already familiar to the reader, he shall be spared a repetition of it. It is needless to say that the lawyer listened with earnest attention.</p> 
<p>"This is a curious story," he said, "but I see no reason to question its accuracy. I certainly hope it is true."</p> 
<p>"It is true, sir."</p> 
<p>"Of course, I imply no doubt of your word. Now, tell me, did you see distinctly the faces of the two men who were employed in concealing the box?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, sir."</p> 
<p>"Should you know them again?"</p> 
<p>"I should."</p> 
<p>"Did you recognize either?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, sir."</p> 
<p>"Indeed!" exclaimed the lawyer, who did not expect an affirmative answer. "Who was it?"</p> 
<p>"Ralph Temple."</p> 
<p>"How did you know him?"</p> 
<p>"He lives in a poor cabin just on the outskirts of the wood."</p> 
<p>"How long has he lived there?"</p> 
<p>"About two years."</p> 
<p>"What is his reputation?"</p> 
<p>"Very poor. No one knows how he makes his living, though at times he seems to have plenty of money."</p> 
<p>"Is he absent a part of his time?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, sir; he is sometimes away for a month at a time."</p> 
<p>"Probably he is in league with some criminals in the city, and may have an object in living where he does."</p> 
<p>"I thought of that, sir."</p> 
<p>"Did you recognize the other man?" the lawyer next asked.</p> 
<p>"No, sir. It was no one I ever saw before; but I noticed his face well, and should know him again."</p> 
<p>"So far, so good. Can you find or lead others to the place in the wood where the box was concealed?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, sir; but I don't think they will leave it there long. Something ought to be done soon."</p> 
<p>"Something shall be done. By the way, have you mentioned what you saw to any person?"</p> 
<p>"To only one--an old gentleman boarding at my mother's house."</p> 
<p>The lawyer looked annoyed.</p> 
<p>"I am sorry for that. It may be all over the village before you get back, and, in that case, your information may do no good."</p> 
<p>"Don't be afraid, sir. Obed Wilkins can keep a secret."</p> 
<p>"Obed Wilkins! Does he come from Illinois?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, sir."</p> 
<p>"I know him," said the lawyer, smiling. "In fact, he is a client of mine. As you say, he can keep a secret. My boy--by the way, what is your name?"</p> 
<p>"Harry Gilbert."</p> 
<p>"Very well, Harry, your chance of earning the reward offered is very good."</p> 
<p>"I did not come here with any thought of the reward."</p> 
<p>"Perhaps not; but the owner can very well afford to pay it, and I advise you to accept it if your information leads to the recovery of the box."</p> 
<p>"Doesn't it belong to you, sir?"</p> 
<p>"Oh, no. It belongs to one of my clients. It disappeared from my office two days since. The owner is not yet aware of his loss, but I felt authorized to offer the reward. May I count on your further help?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, sir."</p> 
<p>"Then I shall send you at once with a note to a police officer, requesting two detectives to accompany you back. I shall give them instructions, and they will probably go back with you to the country."</p> 
<p>"Very well, sir."</p> 
<p>Mr. Wheeler dashed off a few lines, properly addressed them, and handed them to Harry.</p> 
<p>"Use all dispatch," he said.</p> 
<p>"I will," answered our hero, promptly.</p> 
<p>As he left the inner office, the clerk outside regarded him curiously. He was surprised at the long interview accorded him, and wondered what could be his errand.</p> 
<p>As Harry descended the stairs, he jostled a man who was ascending, and naturally was led to look at him. Harry came near dropping with sheer surprise. The man he recognized at once as Vernon, one of the men whom he had seen in the wood.</p>
