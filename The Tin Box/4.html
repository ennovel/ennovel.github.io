<p>Her pride compelled her to the course, notwithstanding the extra trouble she incurred, and this, also, she laid up against Harry. Her husband was opposed to any change, not being so spiteful as his wife, but allowed her to have her way.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile Mr. Mead, though he regretted to lose a good customer, did not show any signs of financial weakness, and there seemed to be no prospect of his failing.</p> 
<p>Had he done so Mrs. Ross would have been overjoyed, for she was very angry at all who upheld "that low Gilbert boy," as she designated him.</p> 
<p>It is said that all things come to him who waits, and circumstances were shaping themselves in a very gratifying way to Mrs. Ross and her schemes of revenge.</p> 
<p>One day as Harry was driving the store wagon which bore the name of his employer he was hailed, about a mile from the store, by a boy about his own age, who carried in his hand a carpetbag, and appeared to be making a journey on foot.</p> 
<p>"Hello!" said the traveler.</p> 
<p>"Hello!" returned Harry.</p> 
<p>"Are you working for my uncle?" asked the stranger.</p> 
<p>"I can tell you better when I find out who your uncle is. If you are the nephew of General Grant, or the czar of Russia, I am not working for him."</p> 
<p>"I see you like to joke," said the stranger. "My uncle is Mr. Mead, the storekeeper."</p> 
<p>"That is the name of the man I work for."</p> 
<p>"Then I guess you had better give me a lift, for I am going to my uncle's."</p> 
<p>"All right! Glad to have your company."</p> 
<p>"What's your name?" asked the stranger.</p> 
<p>"Harry Gilbert. What's yours?"</p> 
<p>"Howard Randall."</p> 
<p>"Where do you live?"</p> 
<p>"I used to live at Upton, but my father is dead, and mother--she's Mrs. Mead's sister--told me I'd better come to see if Uncle Reuben wouldn't give me a place in his store."</p> 
<p>Instantly it flashed upon Harry that this new boy's arrival was likely to endanger his prospects. Mr. Mead, as he knew, had no occasion for the services of two boys, and he would naturally give his nephew the preference. He was not unjust enough to take a dislike to Howard in consequence. Indeed, the new boy had a pleasant face and manner, which led him to think he would like him for a friend.</p> 
<p>"If I do lose my place," thought Harry, "I will put my trust in God. I don't think He will see me or mother suffer, and I won't borrow trouble until it comes."</p> 
<p>"Were you ever employed in a store?" he asked, pleasantly.</p> 
<p>"No; that is, not regularly. I have been in our grocery store at home for a few days at a time, when the storekeeper's son was sick."</p> 
<p>"You look as if you were about my age."</p> 
<p>"I am sixteen. My birthday came last month."</p> 
<p>"Then you are a little older. I am not sixteen yet."</p> 
<p>"You look stronger than I. I should think you were older."</p> 
<p>Harry felt flattered. All boys like to be considered strong and large for their age, and our hero was no exception to the general rule in this respect.</p> 
<p>"I don't know about that," he answered. "I guess we are a pretty good match. How far off is Upton?"</p> 
<p>"Fifty miles."</p> 
<p>"You haven't walked all the way, have you?" inquired Harry, in surprise.</p> 
<p>"Every step," said Howard, proudly. "You see, money isn't very plenty with us, and I told mother I didn't mind walking. I got a lift for a few miles the first day, so I haven't walked quite all the way."</p> 
<p>"You and I seem to be situated pretty much the same way," said Harry. "I have no father, and we have hard work to get along."</p> 
<p>"You seem like a tiptop fellow. I think I shall like you."</p> 
<p>"The same to you," said Harry, smiling. "I am glad you are coming to Greenville to live."</p> 
<p>Harry was sincere enough in his words, so far as his impressions about the boy went, but when he reflected that through him he was likely to lose his place he felt a little troubled.</p> 
<p>"Look here!" said Howard, suddenly; "will you lose your place if uncle takes me into his store?"</p> 
<p>"I don't think he will need two boys," replied Harry, soberly.</p> 
<p>"Then I'd better see if I can't find a place somewhere else. I don't want to take away your place, if you are poor and need the money uncle pays you."</p> 
<p>"I do need it, but I guess something else will turn up for me. You are Mr. Mead's nephew, and ought to have it."</p> 
<p>"I hope we shall be friends, at any rate," said Howard, warmly.</p> 
<p>"I am sure we shall, Howard," returned Harry, cordially, who felt attracted toward his new friend, in spite of the misfortune which his arrival would bring to him personally.</p> 
<p>Just then, within a quarter of a mile of the store, Harry saw his young enemy, Philip Ross, approaching him.</p> 
<p>Philip was driving his buggy, which had been repaired since the accident.</p> 
<p>"I wonder if he will turn out for me?" thought Harry.</p> 
<p>Philip had learned wisdom from experience, and did turn out for the store wagon. He knew Harry's firmness too well to put it to the test a second time at his own expense.</p> 
<p>"Good-morning, Philip," said Harry, in his usual manner.</p> 
<p>Philip did not notice Harry's salutation, but held his head very high, while his face reddened and his lip curled as he drove by his late antagonist.</p> 
<p>"Who is that boy?" asked Howard, whose attention was drawn to Philip's singular conduct.</p> 
<p>"Philip Ross, son of Colonel Ross, a rich man in town."</p> 
<p>"Is he deaf?"</p> 
<p>"No."</p> 
<p>"He didn't seem to hear you say good-morning."</p> 
<p>"Oh, yes, he did," answered Harry, laughing; "but Philip isn't very fond of me."</p> 
<p>"Are you enemies?"</p> 
<p>"We had a little difficulty lately, and Philip hasn't got over it yet."</p> 
<p>"Tell me about it."</p> 
<p>Harry told the story, and Howard fully sustained him in what he had done.</p> 
<p>"He must be a mean boy."</p> 
<p>"He thinks he has more rights than common folks, such as he considers me. He tried--or, at least, his mother did--to have Mr. Mead turn me off, but your uncle is too just a man to go against me for doing my duty."</p> 
<p>"I noticed he gave you half the road this time," said Howard.</p> 
<p>"Yes," answered Harry, with a smile. "He doesn't care to have his wheel taken off again."</p> 
<p>By this time they had reached the store, and Howard introduced himself to his uncle. The next day the blow fell.</p> 
<p>"Harry," said Mr. Mead, "I've got bad news for you. My nephew stands in need of a place, and I can't afford to keep two boys. I wish I could keep you, too."</p> 
<p>"I see how it is, Mr. Mead," said Harry, calmly, though his heart sank within him. "Howard has the best right to the place. I trust something will turn up for me."</p> 
<p>"I have been perfectly satisfied with you, and am ready to give you the highest recommendation for honesty and fidelity."</p> 
<p>"Thank you, Mr. Mead."</p> 
<p>"You will stay till Saturday night, of course, unless something else should offer before that."</p> 
<p>Poor Harry! His heart sank within him as he thought of the serious difference which the loss of his wages would make at home. The prospect of another situation was not very good, for Greenville was a small, quiet place, with very few places of business.</p>
