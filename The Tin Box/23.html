A grown man could not have shown more judgment."</p> 
<p>"Thank you, sir," said Harry, pleased at the compliment.</p> 
<p>"But your work is not yet done. As soon as the detectives have returned, you must go back at once to Waybridge with them, and lead them to the place where the box is concealed."</p> 
<p>"I am ready, sir," replied Harry. "But," he added, with a sudden thought of one of his errands, "will there be time for me to go to Wall Street first?"</p> 
<p>"Why do you want to go to Wall Street?"</p> 
<p>"I have some coupons which I am to sell for Mr. Wilkins."</p> 
<p>"To what amount?"</p> 
<p>"Ninety dollars gold."</p> 
<p>"I will myself give you the money for them, as that will save time. Should the search for the box be successful, I will take upon me to pay you the reward as soon as you desire it."</p> 
<p>"Thank you, sir."</p> 
<p>Harry might have declined the reward, but he felt, justly, that he had rendered a valuable service to the unknown owner of the bonds, and was entitled to it.</p> 
<p>Presently the detectives came back.</p> 
<p>"Well," said the lawyer.</p> 
<p>"He is safe under lock and key," promptly answered one of them.</p> 
<p>"How did he appear?"</p> 
<p>"Sullen and despondent. He vows vengeance against this boy."</p> 
<p>"Probably he will not be in a position for some years to harm him. And now I have some instructions to give you."</p> 
<p>Half an hour later Harry and the two detectives were passengers on a train bound for a town not far from Waybridge. It was a different railroad, however, from the one on which Harry had come. The choice was made from a desire to avoid suspicion.</p> 
<p>From a point four miles distant they took a carriage, hired from a stable, which left them on the opposite side of the wood from the one by which Harry had previously entered.</p> 
<p>Of course, they could not penetrate the wood with a vehicle, and the question came up:</p> 
<p>"Who can be got to look after it?"</p> 
<p>Just then Harry saw in a field near-by Reuben Richardson--the boy who had released him from his bonds.</p> 
<p>"Reuben!" he called out</p> 
<p>Reuben approached, regarding Harry and his companions with surprise.</p> 
<p>"Have you an hour to spare?" asked one of the detectives.</p> 
<p>"Yes, sir."</p> 
<p>"Then please look after this team, and I'll see that you don't lose your time."</p> 
<p>"All right, sir."</p> 
<p>Then, free from all anxiety, the three made their way into the forest. The way seemed blind enough to the two detectives, who were, of course, on unfamiliar ground.</p> 
<p>"Are you sure you can find the place?" asked one of them, doubtfully, addressing himself to Harry.</p> 
<p>"Sure," answered Harry, briefly.</p> 
<p>"It seems blind."</p> 
<p>"I know the wood well. I have played here from a boy."</p> 
<p>"Where does this Temple live?" asked the second detective.</p> 
<p>"In the edge of the wood."</p> 
<p>"Near here?"</p> 
<p>"No, on the other side of the wood."</p> 
<p>"It is to be hoped he has not grown distrustful and removed the box."</p> 
<p>"I don't think there is any danger of it, sir. Remember, it is only last night that it was concealed. Besides, he wouldn't dare to attempt it in the daytime, when he would be liable to be seen."</p> 
<p>"Quite right. You are unusually considerate for a boy."</p> 
<p>Harry did not disappoint his companions. He led the way to the place where, the night previous, he had seen the tin box secreted, and instantly pointed out the exact spot where it was concealed.</p> 
<p>The two detectives lost no time in searching for it. They had brought no shovel with them, lest, being seen, their object might excite suspicion; but, by means of sticks which they sharpened into stakes with the help of sharp jackknives, they turned up the earth, and, in due time, revealed the box.</p> 
<p>"There it is," said Harry, joyfully, for he was also helping, and it was his stake that struck it first.</p> 
<p>"So it is," exclaimed the first detective, in a tone of satisfaction.</p> 
<p>There was no loss of time in lifting the box from its place of concealment. Then it was thought best to replace the earth, and carefully to cover the place with leaves, so as to hide from the superficial observer the fact that it had been disturbed.</p> 
<p>"Our errand is accomplished," said the second detective. "Now let us make all haste back to our wagon."</p> 
<p>"I will guide you," said Harry.</p> 
<p>"Do so, or there is no knowing when we shall get back, or whether we shall get back at all. I once lost my way in a wood, and was wandering about four good hours, and all within a radius of two miles, before I got out. It is difficult to keep your direction in a forest, unless you have a compass."</p> 
<p>So Harry, who had expected it, served as a guide on the return, and conducted them safely to the wagon.</p> 
<p>Reuben was paid for his service with a dollar bill, which he declared he should have considered satisfactory for a whole day's labor.</p> 
<p>Harry was about to say good-by to his companions, but they advised him to ride back with them to a point on the road where he could make his way to Waybridge without the trouble of passing through the wood, besides having a less distance to go.</p> 
<p>"What time is it?" he asked.</p> 
<p>"Two o'clock," answered one of the detectives, consulting his watch.</p> 
<p>"Only two o'clock!"</p> 
<p>Harry could scarcely believe it, so much had happened since he got up in the morning, yet it was even so. It had taken very little time to do his business in the city, as we know, and almost half the day still lay before him.</p> 
<p>Harry thought of what he had accomplished with pardonable pride and satisfaction. He had frustrated the plans of two daring thieves, caused the arrest of one of them, and the probable speedy arrest of the other, arranged for the restoration to the owner of a valuable property, and earned for himself the munificent sum of two hundred and fifty dollars.</p> 
<p>Nothing particular happened on his homeward walk.</p> 
<p>"Got home so soon, Harry?" asked Uncle Obed, as our hero entered the little cottage.</p> 
<p>"Yes, sir; and here's the money for your coupons."</p> 
<p>"How about that other matter, Harry?"</p> 
<p>"It came out all right. Where's mother?"</p> 
<p>"Gone to call on one of the neighbors."</p> 
<p>"Then I'll tell you about it; but I don't want to say a word to mother till the whole thing is settled."</p>
