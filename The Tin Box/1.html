<p>"Yes, mother. I don't want to be late for the store. Saturday is always a busy day."</p> 
<p>"It is a long day for you, Harry. You have to stay till nine o'clock in the evening."</p> 
<p>"I am always glad to have Saturday come, for then I can get my money," replied Harry, laughing. "Well, good-by, mother--I'm off."</p> 
<p>"What should I do without him?" said Mrs. Gilbert to herself, as Harry dashed out of the yard on the way to Mead's grocery store, where he had been employed for six months.</p> 
<p>That would have been a difficult question to answer. Mrs. Gilbert was the widow of a sea captain, who had sailed from the port of Boston three years before, and never since been heard of.</p> 
<p>It was supposed that the vessel was lost with all hands, but how the disaster occurred, or when, was a mystery that seemed never likely to be solved.</p> 
<p>Captain Gilbert had left no property except the small cottage, which was mortgaged for half its value, and a small sum of money in the savings bank, which, by this time, was all expended for the necessaries of life.</p> 
<p>Fortunately for the widow, about the time this sum gave out Harry obtained a situation at Mead's grocery store, with a salary of four dollars a week. This he regularly paid to his mother, and, with the little she herself was able to earn, they lived comfortably. It was hard work for Harry, but he enjoyed it, for he was an active boy, and it was a source of great satisfaction to him that he was able to help his mother so materially.</p> 
<p>He was now fifteen years old, about the average height for a boy of that age, with a strong frame and a bright, cheerful manner that made him a general favorite.</p> 
<p>The part of his duty which he liked best was to drive the store wagon for the delivery of goods to customers. Most boys of his age like to drive a horse, and Harry was no exception to the rule.</p> 
<p>When he reached the store Mr. Mead, his employer, said:</p> 
<p>"Harness up the horse as soon as you can, Harry. There are some goods to be carried out."</p> 
<p>"All right, sir," answered Harry, cheerfully, and made his way to the stable, which stood in the rear of the store. It was but a few minutes before he was loaded up and was on his way.</p> 
<p>He had called at several places and left the greater part of the goods, when he found himself in a narrow road, scarcely wider than a lane. Why it had been made so narrow was unaccountable, for there was certainly land enough to be had, and that of little value, which could have been used. It was probably owing to a want of foresight on the part of the road commissioners.</p> 
<p>Just at the narrowest part of the road Harry saw approaching him an open buggy of rather a pretentious character, driven by a schoolmate, Philip Ross, the son of Colonel Ross, a wealthy resident of the village.</p> 
<p>I have said that Philip was, or rather had been, a schoolmate of Harry. I cannot call him a friend. Philip was of a haughty, arrogant temper. The horse and buggy he drove were his own--that is, they had been given him by his father on his last birthday--and he was proud of them, not without some reason, for the buggy was a handsome one, and the horse was spirited and of fine appearance.</p> 
<p>As soon as Harry saw Philip approaching, he proceeded to turn his horse to one side of the road.</p> 
<p>Philip, however, made no such move, but kept in the middle.</p> 
<p>"Isn't he going to turn out?" thought Harry. "How does he expect to get by?"</p> 
<p>"Why don't you turn out, Philip?" he called out.</p> 
<p>"Turn out yourself!" retorted Philip, haughtily.</p> 
<p>"That's what I'm doing," said Harry, rather provoked.</p> 
<p>"Then turn out more!" said the young gentleman, arrogantly.</p> 
<p>"I have turned out my share," said Harry, stopping his horse. "Do you expect to keep right on in the middle of the road?"</p> 
<p>"I shall if I choose," said Philip, unpleasantly; but he, too, reined up his horse, so that the two teams stood facing each other.</p> 
<p>Harry shrugged his shoulders, and asked, temperately:</p> 
<p>"Then how do you expect to get by?"</p> 
<p>"I want you to turn out as far as you can," he said authoritatively.</p> 
<p>Harry was provoked, and not without reason.</p> 
<p>"I have turned out my share, and shan't turn out another inch," he said, firmly. "You must be a fool to expect it."</p> 
<p>"Do you mean to call me a fool?" demanded Philip, his eyes flashing.</p> 
<p>"You certainly act like one."</p> 
<p>"You'd better take care how you talk, you beggar!" exclaimed Philip, furiously.</p> 
<p>"I'm no more a beggar than you are, Philip Ross!"</p> 
<p>"Well, you are nothing but a working boy, at any rate."</p> 
<p>"What if I am?" replied Harry. "I've got just as much right on this road as you."</p> 
<p>"I'm a gentleman," asserted Philip, angrily.</p> 
<p>"Well, you don't act like one; you'd better turn out pretty quick, for I am in a hurry and can't wait."</p> 
<p>"Then turn out more."</p> 
<p>"I shan't do it," said Harry, with spirit; "and no one but you would be unreasonable enough to ask me to do it."</p> 
<p>"Then you'll have to wait," said Philip, settling himself back provokingly in his seat, and eyeing Harry with a look of disdain.</p> 
<p>"Come, don't be obstinate, Philip," urged Harry, impatiently. "I only ask you to do your share of turning. We have equal rights here, even if you were three times the gentleman you pretend to be."</p> 
<p>"You are insolent, Harry Gilbert. I don't take orders from such as you."</p> 
<p>"Then you won't turn out?" asked Harry, gathering up his reins.</p> 
<p>"Suppose I don't?" retorted Philip, in a provoking tone.</p> 
<p>"Then I shall drive on," said Harry, resolutely.</p> 
<p>"You wouldn't dare to!"</p> 
<p>"Wouldn't I? You'll see. I will count ten, and if at the end of that time you don't turn out, I will drive on, and make you take the consequences."</p> 
<p>Philip glanced at him doubtfully. Would he really do what he said?</p> 
<p>"Pooh! I don't believe it!" he decided. "Anyway, I'm not going to give way to a working boy. I won't do it."</p> 
<p>I am not going to decide the question whether Harry did right or not. I can only say that he claimed no more than his rights, and was not without excuse for the course he adopted.</p> 
<p>"One--two--three!" counted Harry, and so on until he had counted ten.</p> 
<p>Then, gathering up his reins, he said: "I ask you, Philip, for the last time, whether you will turn out?"</p> 
<p>"I won't till I get ready."</p> 
<p>"Go 'long, Dobbin!" was Harry's sole reply. And his horse was put in motion.</p> 
<p>The natural result followed. The grocery wagon was strongly made, and fitted for rough usage. The buggy was of light structure, built for speed, and was no match for it. The two carriages locked wheels. That of the wagon was unharmed, but the wheel of the buggy came off.</p> 
<p>The horse darted forward. Philip was thrown out at the side, aiming an ineffectual blow with his whip at Harry, as he found himself going, and landed in a half stunned condition on the grass at the side.</p> 
<p>Harry kept on until his wagon was clear of the wreck of the buggy, and then halting it, jumped oft to find the extent of Philip's injuries.</p> 
<p>The latter's horse, which had by a violent jerk freed himself from the shafts, was galloping up the road.</p>
