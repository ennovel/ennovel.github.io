<p>As he opened his eyes and saw the face of Harry bending over him, all came back to him, and his animosity revived.</p> 
<p>"Get away from me!" he exclaimed furiously, as he staggered to his feet.</p> 
<p>"I certainly will, if you don't need help," said Harry, glad that Philip had suffered no harm.</p> 
<p>"Where is my horse?" demanded Philip.</p> 
<p>"He has run away."</p> 
<p>"And it's all your fault!" exclaimed Philip, angrily. "My buggy's broken, too, and all because you ran into me, you beggar!"</p> 
<p>"I wouldn't allow you to call me names if you hadn't been punished already for your unreasonable conduct," said Harry, calmly. "Whatever has happened you brought upon yourself."</p> 
<p>"Catch my horse!" ordered Philip, with the air of a master addressing a servant.</p> 
<p>"I've got something else to do," said Harry, coolly, and he sprang into the store wagon.</p> 
<p>"Are you going to drive off and leave me here?" demanded Philip, enraged.</p> 
<p>"I must, for my time isn't my own. It belongs to Mr. Mead. I would help you otherwise--though you are to blame for what has happened."</p> 
<p>"You will suffer for this!" exclaimed the rich man's son, gazing at his broken buggy in helpless anger. "You'll have to pay for all the damage you have done!"</p> 
<p>"You can go to law about it, if you want to," said Harry, as he gathered the reins into his hands, and he drove off. "I've a good defense."</p> 
<p>To Philip's disgust, Harry drove off, leaving him alone with his disabled carriage. It was a good time to consider whether he had acted wisely in demanding more than the law or custom allowed him, but Philip was too angry for cool consideration.</p> 
<p>He could not persuade himself that a boy like Harry, the son of a poor widow, who had to work for his own living, had equal rights with himself.</p> 
<p>In the end he had to go home and bring back his father's hired man to take charge of the wreck. He learned that the frightened horse had already found his way to the stable, terrifying the family with fears that Philip had been seriously hurt on the way.</p> 
<p>Philip gave a garbled account of the affair to his father and mother, and excited the indignation of both, but especially his mother.</p> 
<p>"I never heard of such an outrage--never!" exclaimed Mrs. Ross, emphatically. "To think that boy should deliberately run into you and endanger your life--my poor Philip!"</p> 
<p>"That's just what he did, mother," said Philip, enjoying the indignation he had aroused.</p> 
<p>Colonel Ross was not quite so thoroughly convinced that his son was right.</p> 
<p>"Did you give Harry half the road?" he inquired.</p> 
<p>"I gave him room enough to get by," answered Philip, evasively.</p> 
<p>"The law requires that you should give him half the road."</p> 
<p>"I hope, Mr. Ross, you don't justify that horrid boy in running into Philip?" said Mrs. Ross, sharply.</p> 
<p>"No, my dear; I consider that he acted very badly. But, in Order to make him amenable to the law for the damage Philip's team suffered, it must appear that Philip gave him half the road."</p> 
<p>"Then the law ought to be altered," said Mrs. Ross, with more anger than reason. "I've no doubt that Philip gave him all the room he needed."</p> 
<p>"When you were thrown out, did the heartless boy ride on and leave you to your fate?" asked the mother.</p> 
<p>"No; he got out and asked me if I was hurt," Philip admitted, reluctantly.</p> 
<p>"Much he cared!" said Mrs. Ross, contemptuously.</p> 
<p>"I suppose he was afraid he would be put in prison if I was killed," said Philip.</p> 
<p>"Yes, that was his motive, undoubtedly. He didn't offer to help you, I suppose?"</p> 
<p>"No; I asked him to, and he wouldn't," answered Philip, glad that he could blacken poor Harry's character.</p> 
<p>"The unfeeling young villain!" ejaculated Mrs. Ross. "He ought to be put in the State's prison!"</p> 
<p>"Do you think he can be?" asked Philip, eagerly.</p> 
<p>"Of course he can, if your father exerts himself as he ought."</p> 
<p>"Nonsense, Lucinda!" said Colonel Ross, who was not a fool. "It was a boyish misunderstanding."</p> 
<p>"You may call it that," retorted Mrs. Ross, raising her voice. "I call it a high-handed outrage. The boy ought to be arrested. Are you going to do anything about it, Philander Ross?"</p> 
<p>Mrs. Ross generally addressed her husband by his Christian name when she was angry with him.</p> 
<p>"I will tell you what I will do, Lucinda. I will see Mead, and tell him that a boy who acts in that way is not fit to drive for him."</p> 
<p>"That's right, father. Make him discharge Harry. Then he'll have to go to the poorhouse, or beg."</p> 
<p>"And a very suitable punishment for him," said Mrs. Ross, approvingly.</p> 
<p>"I don't quite like to take the boy's means of living away from him," said Colonel Ross, who was by no means as unfeeling as his wife and son. "That would make his mother suffer, and she has been guilty of no crime."</p> 
<p>"She will uphold him in his iniquity, you may rest assured, Mr. Ross," said his wife, nodding emphatically. "If she had brought up the boy to be respectful to his superiors this would not have happened."</p> 
<p>"He won't be able to pay damages if he loses his place," said Colonel Ross.</p> 
<p>"I don't care. I want him discharged from his situation."</p> 
<p>"Well, Lucinda," said her husband, shrugging his shoulders, "you had better undertake the management of the affair. I am very busy, and can't spare the necessary time."</p> 
<p>"I will!" said Mrs. Ross, with alacrity. "I will call on the boy's mother, and also on Mr. Mead."</p> 
<p>"Don't be too extreme, Lucinda. Remember, it isn't a hanging matter."</p> 
<p>"I am not so sure but it ought to be. My poor child might have broken his neck. Oh, it makes my blood run cold when I think that he might be lying lifeless before me at this moment."</p> 
<p>"Don't say such things, mother," said Philip, nervously, unpleasantly affected by the picture his mother had drawn.</p> 
<p>"I can't help saying it, for it might have happened."</p> 
<p>"Where are you going to first, mother?" asked Philip.</p> 
<p>"I will go first and call on Widow Gilbert. I consider her responsible, for if she had brought up the boy better this would never have happened."</p> 
<p>"May I go with you?"</p> 
<p>"No; I would rather go alone."</p> 
<p>If Philip had only been scarred, or had a wound to show, his mother would have taken him with her, to make her reproof more effective, but, as he showed no marks of the encounter, she saw no advantage in his presence.</p> 
<p>"You just give it to her, mother," said Philip, in a tone of satisfaction.</p> 
<p>"I shall know what to say, my son."</p> 
<p>"Just frighten her, and make her think we are going to have Harry arrested."</p> 
<p>"I shall make her understand that the boy has done a very serious thing, and has made himself amenable to the law."</p> 
<p>"That's right, mother. Harry is too airy altogether. He seems to think that I am no better than he is--a common working boy like him!"</p> 
<p>Mrs. Ross sailed out of the room, and dressed herself with unusual care, not out of respect for Mrs. Gilbert, but rather with the purpose of impressing her with her grandeur.</p>
