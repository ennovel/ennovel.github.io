<p>In the evening, when he got home from the store, he seemed so restless that his mother asked him what was the matter with him.</p> 
<p>"This is my last week at the store, mother," he answered, soberly. "I suppose that is what makes me feel nervous."</p> 
<p>"Has Mr. Mead been induced by Mrs. Ross to turn you away?" asked Mrs. Gilbert, beginning to feel indignant.</p> 
<p>"No; he isn't that kind of a man."</p> 
<p>"Isn't he satisfied with you?"</p> 
<p>"I ought to have told you at first that a nephew of his own needs the place, and he can't afford to employ two boys."</p> 
<p>"I believe Mrs. Ross is at the bottom of it, after all," said Mrs. Gilbert.</p> 
<p>"No, mother; there you are wrong," and Harry went on to explain that Howard's appearance was a surprise to his uncle.</p> 
<p>"What kind of a boy is he?" asked the widow, disposed to dislike in advance the boy who had been the means of depriving her son of a place.</p> 
<p>"He's a nice fellow. I like him already. Of course I am sorry to lose my place, but, if I must, I am willing he should have it. I think we shall be good friends."</p> 
<p>"But what are you going to do, Harry?" asked his mother, anxiously. "Your wages have been our dependence."</p> 
<p>"I am sure I shall get something else to do, mother," said Harry, in a tone of confidence which he did not feel. "Tending store isn't the only thing to be done."</p> 
<p>"I am sure, I hope so," said Mrs. Gilbert, despondently.</p> 
<p>"Don't trouble yourself, mother, about the future. Just leave it to me, and you'll see if I don't get something to do."</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, the widow could not help troubling herself. She knew that employment was hard to find in the village, at any rate and could not conjecture where Harry was to find it. She did not, however, say much on the subject, fearing to depress his spirits.</p> 
<p>Saturday night came, and Harry received his wages.</p> 
<p>"I don't know where my next week's wages are coming from, Mr. Mead," he said, soberly.</p> 
<p>"You may be sure that I will recommend you for any employment I hear of, Harry," said Mr. Mead, earnestly. "I really wish I could afford to keep you on. You mustn't allow yourself to be discouraged."</p> 
<p>"I won't--if I can help it," answered Harry.</p> 
<p>The next day was Sunday, and he did not realize that he was out of a position; but, when Monday morning came, and he could lie abed as long as he pleased, with no call to work, he felt sad.</p> 
<p>After a light breakfast, he rose from the table and took his hat.</p> 
<p>"Where are you going, Harry?" asked his mother.</p> 
<p>"I am going out in search of a job, mother," he replied.</p> 
<p>The number of stores was limited, and he was pretty sure in advance that there was no opening in any one of them, but he wanted to make sure.</p> 
<p>He applied at one after another, and without success.</p> 
<p>"I'd take you quick enough, Harry," said Mr. Draper, the dry-goods dealer, "but I've got all the help I need."</p> 
<p>"So I expected, Mr. Draper, but I thought I would ask."</p> 
<p>"All right, Harry. If I hear of anything, I will be sure to let you know," said Mr. Draper, in a friendly tone.</p> 
<p>All this evidence of friendliness was, of course, pleasant, but the prospect of a place would have been more welcome, so poor Harry thought. At ten o'clock he reached home.</p> 
<p>His mother looked up when he entered, but she saw, by the expression of his face, that he had not succeeded.</p> 
<p>"You must be tired, Harry," she said. "You had better sit down and rest."</p> 
<p>"Oh, no, I'm not tired, mother. If you'll tell me where the four-quart kettle is, I'll go and pick some blueberries."</p> 
<p>"What will you do with so many, Harry?"</p> 
<p>"Carry them to Mr. Mead. Every two days he sends a supply to market."</p> 
<p>"How much does he pay?" asked the widow, brightening up at this glimpse of money to be earned.</p> 
<p>"Eight cents a quart, payable in groceries. It won't be much, but will be better than nothing."</p> 
<p>"So it will, Harry. I don't know but I can do better going with you than to stay at home and sew."</p> 
<p>"No, mother; you would be sure to get a headache, exposed to the sun in the open pasture. Leave me to pick berries. It is more suitable for me."</p> 
<p>"What time will you get home to dinner, Harry?"</p> 
<p>"I shall not come home till the middle of the afternoon. I'll take a little lunch with me, and eat in the pasture."</p> 
<p>So Harry started out, pail in hand, for the berry pasture. It was about a mile away, and was of large extent, comprising, probably, thirty acres of land. It was Harry's first expedition of the kind in the season, as his time had been so fully occupied at the store that he had had no leisure for picking berries.</p> 
<p>The berries were not so plentiful as they had been somewhat earlier, but they were still to be found in considerable quantities.</p> 
<p>Harry was not alone. Probably a dozen other persons were in the pasture, engaged in the same way as himself. All knew Harry, and some, who had not heard of his loss of place, were surprised to see him there.</p> 
<p>"And how is it you are here, Harry?" asked Mrs. Ryan, a good-natured Irish woman, who was out, with three of her children, reaping a harvest of berries. "And how can Mr. Mead spare you?"</p> 
<p>"Because he's got another boy," answered Harry.</p> 
<p>"Shure it was mane to send you away, and your mother nadin' your wages."</p> 
<p>"He couldn't help it. He had a nephew that needed the place. But, perhaps, I can make a fortune, like you, picking berries."</p> 
<p>"And shure you'd have to live a hundred years to do that, and have berries ripe all the year round. It's hard work, Harry, and poor pay."</p> 
<p>"You have the advantage of me, Mrs. Ryan. You've got three children to help you."</p> 
<p>"And don't I have to buy food and clothes for the same? Shure, you're welcome to all they earn, if you'll board and clothe 'em."</p> 
<p>"I didn't think of that. Perhaps I am better off as I am."</p> 
<p>"And so ye are, I'm thinkin'."</p> 
<p>Harry found that, exert himself as he might, Mrs. Ryan picked nearly as fast as he did. She was used to it, and her pail filled up rapidly.</p> 
<p>Harry was glad he did not bring a larger pail, for to him, unaccustomed to bend over, the work was fatiguing, and when, as the town clock struck two, he saw his pail filled to the brim, he breathed a sigh of relief.</p> 
<p>"If the pail held more, I shouldn't feel satisfied to stop," he said to himself, "so I'm glad it doesn't."</p> 
<p>Mrs. Ryan had two pails and a basket, and each of her children carried a small pail, so that she remained in the pasture after Harry left.</p> 
<p>It was shorter for Harry to go at once to the store, instead of going round by his home, and this he resolved to do.</p> 
<p>About twenty rods from the store, rather to his vexation, he met Philip Ross, elaborately dressed and swinging a light cane.</p> 
<p>Philip, who had not heard of Harry's loss of place, regarded our hero with surprise, not unmixed with curiosity. But for his curiosity, he would have passed him without a word. Curiosity conquered dislike, and he inquired:</p> 
<p>"Does Mead send you out to pick berries?"</p> 
<p>"No," answered Harry.</p> 
<p>"Haven't you been picking berries?"</p> 
<p>"This looks like it, doesn't it?"</p> 
<p>"Of course. Have you a holiday?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, a long holiday. I am not working for Mr. Mead now."</p> 
<p>An expression of joy lighted up the face of Philip.</p> 
<p>"Has he discharged you?" he asked.</p> 
<p>"He has taken his nephew in my place."</p> 
<p>"And so you have to pick berries for a living?" asked Philip, in exultation.</p> 
<p>"Yes," answered Harry, coolly.</p> 
<p>"I must go home and tell mother," said Philip, briskly. "Wait a minute, though. Do you want a job?"</p> 
<p>"Yes," responded Harry, rather surprised that Philip should feel any interest in the matter.</p> 
<p>"Then I can give you one. Come up to the house early every morning, and I'll hire you to black my shoes. I'll give--let me see--thirty cents a week."</p> 
<p>"Thank you, but I couldn't come up to your house. Bring them down to mine every morning, and I may accept the job."</p> 
<p>"Do you think I would demean myself by carrying dirty shoes round the village?" demanded Philip, angrily.</p> 
<p>"I don't know," said Harry, coolly. "You'll have to do it, if you want me to black them."</p> 
<p>Philip muttered something about impudence, but went off very well pleased, to report to his mother that she could trade at Mead's once more, as he had sent off Harry Gilbert.</p>
