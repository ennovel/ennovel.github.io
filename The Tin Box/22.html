<p>"I will hurry as fast as I can," he said. "I suppose he has come about the tin box, too. I hope he will stay till I get back."</p> 
<p>Vernon, little dreaming that he was recognized by the office boy--as he took him to be--who had just jostled against him, kept on his way upstairs. His appearance was that of a well-dressed man, not much over thirty, who might be filling a responsible business position in the city. When, therefore, he said to the clerk, "Is Mr. Wheeler in?" he received a more polite reply than had been accorded to Harry fifteen minutes before.</p> 
<p>"Mr. Wheeler?" he asked.</p> 
<p>"Yes," said the lawyer, with his usual scrutinizing look.</p> 
<p>"I should like to speak to you in private, sir."</p> 
<p>"Another claimant for the reward," thought the lawyer.</p> 
<p>"Very well," he said. "Have the kindness to close the door."</p> 
<p>Vernon did so.</p> 
<p>"Now," said the lawyer, abruptly, desiring to get through with his interview before Harry's return from his mission.</p> 
<p>"You advertised for the recovery of a tin box of valuables?" said Vernon.</p> 
<p>"Yes."</p> 
<p>"I may be able to assist you in the matter," said Vernon.</p> 
<p>"Indeed! Then you know where it is?" said the lawyer, eying him keenly.</p> 
<p>"I didn't say that, did I?" asked Vernon, smiling craftily.</p> 
<p>"No; but you probably know--that is, if your information is of any value."</p> 
<p>"That isn't at all necessary," said Vernon, coolly. "I may say as much as this, however that I am employed by those who do know the whereabouts of the box."</p> 
<p>"Then there was more than one connected with the robbery?"</p> 
<p>"Yes," said Vernon, hesitating.</p> 
<p>He saw that every word was noted, and afforded a basis for inferences.</p> 
<p>"What do your employers authorize you to say?" asked the lawyer, sitting back in his chair.</p> 
<p>"That they can lay their hands on the bonds at short notice, and are ready to return them, if it is made worth their while."</p> 
<p>"I suppose you have read my advertisement, Mr.----"</p> 
<p>"Precisely," answered Vernon, not taking the hint and announcing his name.</p> 
<p>He might do so soon, but resolved not to be precipitate.</p> 
<p>"Then you know what reward we offer."</p> 
<p>"It isn't enough," said Vernon, briefly.</p> 
<p>"Why not? It seems to me that two hundred and fifty dollars is a very respectable sum of money."</p> 
<p>"I shall charge my clients as much as that for my agency," said Vernon, "and they naturally want something for their trouble and risk."</p> 
<p>"Do you know how much the box contains?"</p> 
<p>"Yes; my clients have told me."</p> 
<p>"Do they realize that, if they refuse my offer, they will find considerable trouble in negotiating the bonds?"</p> 
<p>"Yes; but they can do it. There are parties who will advance them much more than the reward, and take the risk, holding them till such time as the affair is forgotten."</p> 
<p>"What parties?"</p> 
<p>"Do you suppose I will tell you that, sir?" asked Vernon, cunningly.</p> 
<p>Mr. Wheeler did not, but he was only filling up the time. He had made up his mind that the man before him was something more than the agent of the thieves, and he now wished to protract the interview till Harry should have had time to return with the two detectives.</p> 
<p>"No," he replied, "I can hardly expect you to answer that question. I should like to ask you, however, whether you have had any conversation with your clients about the sum they would consider sufficient to repay them for their 'trouble'?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, sir; that subject has come up between us."</p> 
<p>"Well?"</p> 
<p>"I think, sir, you will have to multiply the reward you offer by ten."</p> 
<p>"Whew!" exclaimed the lawyer, who was not at all surprised, however. "This is a large sum."</p> 
<p>"It is only about one-sixth the market value of the bonds."</p> 
<p>"I don't think my client would consent to pay so large a sum as that."</p> 
<p>"Then your client must be prepared to lose the whole amount."</p> 
<p>"It appears to me that a thousand dollars would be an adequate, not to say a handsome, reward."</p> 
<p>"What would it amount to divided among four persons, after paying me my commission?"</p> 
<p>"Then there were four persons engaged in the theft?"</p> 
<p>"Better say in the removal of the deposits. It sounds better."</p> 
<p>"Call it so, if you like. Doesn't it occur to you that it hardly required as many as four persons to remove the tin box, weighing with its contents, not over two pounds?"</p> 
<p>"I suppose one could have lifted it," said Vernon, smiling.</p> 
<p>"True; but do you know it is my theory that two persons were engaged?"</p> 
<p>Vernon started, and scanned his companion's face anxiously. Did he know anything? That was what he asked himself.</p> 
<p>"You can form any theories you please," he said, with a forced smile. "They won't alter facts."</p> 
<p>"You are right, Mr.----"</p> 
<p>"You may call me Thompson."</p> 
<p>"Very well, Mr. Thompson."</p> 
<p>By this time a foot was heard upon the stairs. The door opened, and Harry Gilbert entered.</p> 
<p>He came forward, not appearing to notice the visitor, and placed in Mr. Wheeler's hand a scrap of paper, on which he had written in pencil:</p> 
<p>"The man with you is one of the robbers. I can identify him. I met him as I was going out. The two detectives are in the entry. I thought it best not to bring them in till I had a chance to tell you this."</p> 
<p>Mr. Wheeler's eyes lighted up as he read this scrap, and he looked approvingly at Harry.</p> 
<p>"Quite right," he said. Then, turning to Vernon, he continued: "I don't think we can come to terms. I have reason to doubt whether you can carry out your promise and deliver the property."</p> 
<p>"I suppose this is a bluff game, intended to deceive me," said Vernon, showing symptoms of anger. "I can assure you that it will do you no good."</p> 
<p>"I may find out elsewhere the location of the box."</p> 
<p>"Impossible! I, and I alone--that is, outside of the men who employ me--can give you this information. They will follow my advice, whatever it is, and I shall advise them not to surrender the box until they receive an adequate reward."</p> 
<p>"Such as the sum you name?"</p> 
<p>"Yes."</p> 
<p>"Wouldn't two thousand dollars tempt you?" asked the lawyer.</p> 
<p>"I think not. Still, I will consult them. I might advise them to accept that sum."</p> 
<p>"My dear sir, I don't want to deceive you. I attach very little importance to your information, or your power in this matter. In fact, I have a theory as to the place where the box is concealed."</p> 
<p>"Indeed, sir," said Vernon, with a sneer. "May I ask what is your theory?"</p> 
<p>"Certainly. I think it is concealed near some country town, in a secluded spot in a wood."</p> 
<p>Vernon jumped to his feet in dismay. He was convinced that his confederate had got the start of him and made a bargain with the lawyer, thus anticipating his own treachery, for he had promised Temple that he would suffer some time to elapse before communicating with anyone on the subject.</p> 
<p>"Who has been here?" he asked.</p> 
<p>"One who saw you and your confederate bury the box," answered the lawyer, sternly.</p> 
<p>Without a word, Vernon dashed from the office, only to be seized by the two detectives, who had come provided with handcuffs.</p> 
<p>"This is an infamous conspiracy!" declared Vernon, furiously. "If Ralph Temple has betrayed me----</p> 
<p>"Harry," said the lawyer, "do you recognize this man?"</p> 
<p>Vernon stared in surprise at the supposed office boy.</p> 
<p>"Yes, sir."</p> 
<p>"Where did you see him last?"</p> 
<p>"In Pegan Hill Wood, in the town of Waybridge."</p> 
<p>"What was he doing?"</p> 
<p>"Burying a tin box in a hole which he dug for the purpose."</p> 
<p>"Who was with him?"</p> 
<p>"A man named Ralph Temple."</p> 
<p>"What do you say to this, Mr. Thompson?" asked the lawyer.</p> 
<p>Vernon turned to Harry.</p> 
<p>"Where were you at the time?" he asked.</p> 
<p>"In a tree just overhead," answered Harry, undauntedly.</p> 
<p>"I was a fool not to look more carefully about me," he said. "What is your name?"</p> 
<p>"Harry Gilbert."</p> 
<p>"Then, Mr. Harry Gilbert, I owe you a debt which, sooner or later, I shall manage to pay."</p> 
<p>"Take him away," said the lawyer to the detectives, "and then come back to me for instructions."</p>
