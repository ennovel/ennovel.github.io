<p>As he had no place in view, he continued to go to the berry field every day, supplying his mother with what she needed, and disposing of the rest to Mr. Mead.</p> 
<p>The field in which he had at first picked being nearly exhausted, he bent his steps in another direction, where he learned that there was still a good supply. The field belonged to a Mr. Hammond, a substantial farmer, who had no objections to the berries being picked, but required parties to obtain his permission.</p> 
<p>As Mr. Hammond was understood to be very well to do, Mrs. Ross and her son condescended to associate with him and his family on equal terms.</p> 
<p>On the particular morning when Harry sought the field, Philip was crossing the pasture on his way to a river, where he kept a rowboat, when he espied two children, Tommy and Rose Perkins, picking berries.</p> 
<p>They were children of eight and ten, and it occurred to Philip that he had a fine chance to bully them, in the name of Mr. Hammond.</p> 
<p>Striding up to them, with an air of authority, he said:</p> 
<p>"Look here, you children, what business have you in this field?"</p> 
<p>"It isn't yours, is it?" asked Tommy, independently.</p> 
<p>"It belongs to my friend, Mr. Hammond," said Philip. "He don't allow all the loafers in town here."</p> 
<p>"Tommy and I are not loafers," said Rose.</p> 
<p>"All the same, you are trespassing on Mr. Hammond's pasture. Come, clear out."</p> 
<p>"Mr. Hammond gave us leave to come here, and I don't see what business it is of yours," said Tommy.</p> 
<p>"I don't believe he gave you permission at all, and I'll let you know what business it is of mine, you little rascal," said Philip, in a bullying tone.</p> 
<p>Luckily for Tommy and Rose, there was a friend near at hand, who was not disposed to see them abused. Harry Gilbert had reached the bars between the berry pasture and the next field in time to hear Philip's attempt to bully the young brother and sister.</p> 
<p>"Just like Philip," he thought, with a feeling of disgust. "He is always trying to bully those younger than himself, especially if they are poor."</p> 
<p>Tommy and Rose were the children of a widow, no better off than Mrs. Gilbert, and Harry felt a greater sympathy for them on that account.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Philip, not aware that there was help at hand, continued his persecutions.</p> 
<p>"Well, are you going to clear out?" he demanded, in a threatening tone.</p> 
<p>"No," said Tommy. "Mr. Hammond said we might pick berries here, and you have no right to touch us."</p> 
<p>"I'll show you whether I have or not," said Philip, in his most dominating tone.</p> 
<p>He drew back his foot, and deliberately kicked over the children's pails, one after the other. Probably there was not more than a pint in either pail, as the children had just commenced picking, but it was certainly aggravating.</p> 
<p>Rose began to cry, while Tommy, his face turning red, said:</p> 
<p>"I wish I was big enough; I'd make you sorry for what you have done."</p> 
<p>"I see I shall have to give you a lesson," said Philip. "I'll teach you to be impudent to me."</p> 
<p>He advanced toward Tommy in a threatening manner, and Harry thought it time to interfere.</p> 
<p>"Don't touch that boy, you contemptible bully!" he exclaimed, indignantly, hurrying to the scene of conflict.</p> 
<p>"Oh, Harry, make him stop," exclaimed Tommy, in joyful tones.</p> 
<p>"I will," said Harry, resolutely.</p> 
<p>Philip Ross was very much annoyed by the unexpected arrival of Harry, whom he had never been able to intimidate, and would gladly have slunk away if pride had not hindered.</p> 
<p>"You'd better take care what you say," he rejoined, in a surly tone.</p> 
<p>"And you had better take care what you do," returned Harry, manfully. "Why have you been interfering with these poor children?"</p> 
<p>"I am not responsible to you for what I do," said Philip, angrily. "They are trespassing on this field, and I ordered them off."</p> 
<p>"By what right? You don't own it."</p> 
<p>"My friend, Mr. Hammond, does."</p> 
<p>Here Tommy explained that Mr. Hammond had given them permission to pick berries.</p> 
<p>"I don't believe it," said Philip, "and I've no doubt you are trespassing, too."</p> 
<p>"Perhaps you'd like to serve me the same way," suggested Harry.</p> 
<p>"I'll leave Mr. Hammond to kick you out himself."</p> 
<p>"That is more prudent. Stop! where are you going?" for Philip was starting to leave them.</p> 
<p>"I don't like the company I'm in. I'm going to leave you to enjoy each other's society."</p> 
<p>"Not yet," said Harry.</p> 
<p>"Can't you spare me?" sneered Philip.</p> 
<p>"Not till you have picked up the berries you have upset."</p> 
<p>"Do you mean to insult me?" demanded Philip, angrily.</p> 
<p>"No; I am only demanding what is reasonable and right. You upset the berries, and it is only fair you should pick them up."</p> 
<p>"Pick them up yourself!" said Philip.</p> 
<p>Again he started away, but Harry planted himself resolutely in his path.</p> 
<p>"You must pick up those berries or fight me," he said.</p> 
<p>"Keep away from me, you beggar!" screamed Philip.</p> 
<p>"Once more, will you pick up those berries?"</p> 
<p>"No, I won't!"</p> 
<p>Harry's only answer was to seize Philip round the middle, and, despite his struggles, to lay him down on the ground.</p> 
<p>"You'll suffer for this!" said Philip, almost screaming with rage.</p> 
<p>"You can go now," said Harry, contemptuously, "and take care how you interfere with Tommy and Rose again."</p> 
<p>Philip rose from the ground, angry and humiliated, yet not daring to attack Harry, whom he knew to be his superior in strength.</p> 
<p>"You haven't heard the last of this," he said, shaking his fist.</p> 
<p>Harry deigned no reply, and Philip, instead of keeping on his way to the river, turned and walked homeward.</p> 
<p>Harry helped the children pick up their berries, and remained with them through the forenoon.</p>
