In Chicago, whose population still ranged about 500,000, millionaires were not numerous. The rich had not become so conspicuously rich as to drown all moderate incomes in obscurity. The attention of the inhabitants was not so distracted by local celebrities in the dramatic, artistic, social, and religious fields as to shut the well-positioned man from view. In Chicago the two roads to distinction were politics and trade. In New York the roads were any one of a half-hundred, and each had been diligently pursued by hundreds, so that celebrities were numerous. The sea was already full of whales. A common fish must needs disappear wholly from view -- remain unseen. In other words, Hurstwood was nothing. </p> 
<p>There is a more subtle result of such a situation as this, which, though not always taken into account, produces the tragedies of the world. The great create an atmosphere which reacts badly upon the small. This atmosphere is easily and quickly felt. Walk among the magnificent residences, the splendid equipages, the gilded shops, restaurants, resorts of all kinds; scent the flowers, the silks, the wines; drink of the laughter springing from the soul of luxurious content, of the glances which gleam like light from defiant spears; feel the quality of the smiles which cut like glistening swords and of strides born of place, and you shall know of what is the atmosphere of the high and mighty. Little use to argue that of such is not the kingdom of greatness, but so long as the world is attracted by this and the human heart views this as the one desirable realm which it must attain, so long, to that heart, will this remain the realm of greatness. So long, also, will the atmosphere of this realm work its desperate results in the soul of man. It is like a chemical reagent. One day of it, like one drop of the other, will so affect and discolour the views, the aims, the desire of the mind, that it will thereafter remain forever dyed. A day of it to the untried mind is like opium to the untried body. A craving is set up which, if gratified, shall eternally result in dreams and death. Aye! dreams unfulfilled -- gnawing, luring, idle phantoms which beckon and lead, beckon and lead, until death and dissolution dissolve their power and restore us blind to nature's heart. </p> 
<p>A man of Hurstwood's age and temperament is not subject to the illusions and burning desires of youth, but neither has he the strength of hope which gushes as a fountain in the heart of youth. Such an atmosphere could not incite in him the cravings of a boy of eighteen, but in so far as they were excited, the lack of hope made them proportionately bitter. He could not fail to notice the signs of affluence and luxury on every hand. He had been to New York before and knew the resources of its folly. In part it was an awesome place to him, for here gathered all that he most respected on this earth -- wealth, place, and fame. The majority of the celebrities with whom he had tipped glasses in his day as manager hailed from this self-centred and populous spot. The most inviting stories of pleasure and luxury had been told of places and individuals here. He knew it to be true that unconsciously he was brushing elbows with fortune the livelong day; that a hundred or five hundred thousand gave no one the privilege of living more than comfortably in so wealthy a place. Fashion and pomp required more ample sums, so that the poor man was nowhere. All this he realised, now quite sharply, as he faced the city, cut off from his friends, despoiled of his modest fortune, and even his name, and forced to begin the battle for place and comfort all over again. He was not old, but he was not so dull but that he could feel he soon would be. Of a sudden, then, this show of fine clothes, place, and power took on peculiar significance. It was emphasised by contrast with his own distressing state. </p> 
<p>And it was distressing. He soon found that freedom from fear of arrest was not the sine qua non of his existence. That danger dissolved, the next necessity became the grievous thing. The paltry sum of thirteen hundred and some odd dollars set against the need of rent, clothing, food, and pleasure for years to come was a spectacle little calculated to induce peace of mind in one who had been accustomed to spend five times that sum in the course of a year. He thought upon the subject rather actively the first few days he was in New York, and decided that he must act quickly. As a consequence, he consulted the business opportunities advertised in the morning papers and began investigations on his own account. </p> 
<p>That was not before he had become settled, however. Carrie and he went looking for a flat, as arranged, and found one in Seventy-eighth Street near Amsterdam Avenue. It was a five-story building, and their flat was on the third floor. Owing to the fact that the street was not yet built up solidly, it was possible to see east to the green tops of the trees in Central Park and west to the broad waters of the Hudson, a glimpse of which was to be had out of the west windows. For the privilege of six rooms and a bath, running in a straight line, they were compelled to pay thirty-five dollars a month -- an average, and yet exorbitant, rent for a home at the time. Carrie noticed the difference between the size of the rooms here and in Chicago and mentioned it. </p> 
<p>"You'll not find anything better, dear," said Hurstwood, "unless you go into one of the old-fashioned houses, and then you won't have any of these conveniences." </p> 
<p>Carrie picked out the new abode because of its newness and bright wood-work. It was one of the very new ones supplied with steam heat, which was a great advantage. The stationary range, hot and cold water, dumb-waiter, speaking tubes, and call-bell for the janitor pleased her very much. She had enough of the instincts of a housewife to take great satisfaction in these things. </p> 
<p>Hurstwood made arrangement with one of the instalment houses whereby they furnished the flat complete and accepted fifty dollars down and ten dollars a month. He then had a little plate, bearing the name G. W. Wheeler, made, which he placed on his letter-box in the hall. It sounded exceedingly odd to Carrie to be called Mrs. Wheeler by the janitor, but in time she became used to it and looked upon the name as her own. </p> 
<p>These house details settled, Hurstwood visited some of the advertised opportunities to purchase an interest in some flourishing down-town bar. After the palatial resort in Adams Street, he could not stomach the commonplace saloons which he found advertised. He lost a number of days looking up these and finding them disagreeable. He did, however, gain considerable knowledge by talking, for he discovered the influence of Tammany Hall and the value of standing in with the police. The most profitable and flourishing places he found to be those which conducted anything but a legitimate business, such as that controlled by Fitzgerald and Moy. Elegant back rooms and private drinking booths on the second floor were usually adjuncts of very profitable places. He saw by portly keepers, whose shirt fronts shone with large diamonds, and whose clothes were properly cut, that the liquor business here, as elsewhere, yielded the same golden profit. </p> 
<p>At last he found an individual who had a resort in Warren Street, which seemed an excellent venture. It was fairly well-appearing and susceptible of improvement. The owner claimed the business to be excellent, and it certainly looked so. </p> 
<p>"We deal with a very good class of people," he told Hurstwood. "Merchants, salesmen, and professionals. It's a well-dressed class. No bums. We don't allow 'em in the place." </p> 
<p>Hurstwood listened to the cash-register ring, and watched the trade for a while. </p> 
<p>"It's profitable enough for two, is it?" he asked. </p> 
<p>"You can see for yourself if you're any judge of the liquor trade," said the owner. "This is only one of the two places I have. The other is down in Nassau Street. I can't tend to them both alone. If I had some one who knew the business thoroughly I wouldn't mind sharing with him in this one and letting him manage it." </p> 
<p>"I've had experience enough," said Hurstwood blandly, but he felt a little diffident about referring to Fitzgerald and Moy. </p> 
<p>"Well, you can suit yourself, Mr. Wheeler," said the proprietor. </p> 
<p>He only offered a third interest in the stock, fixtures, and good-will, and this in return for a thousand dollars and managerial ability on the part of the one who should come in. There was no property involved, because the owner of the saloon merely rented from an estate. </p> 
<p>The offer was genuine enough, but it was a question with Hurstwood whether a third interest in that locality could be made to yield one hundred and fifty dollars a month, which he figured he must have in order to meet the ordinary family expenses and be comfortable. It was not the time, however, after many failures to find what he wanted, to hesitate. It looked as though a third would pay a hundred a month now. By judicious management and improvement, it might be made to pay more. Accordingly he agreed to enter into partnership, and made over his thousand dollars, preparing to enter the next day. </p> 
<p>His first inclination was to be elated, and he confided to Carrie that he thought he had made an excellent arrangement. Time, however, introduced food for reflection. He found his partner to be very disagreeable. Frequently he was the worse for liquor, which made him surly. This was the last thing which Hurstwood was used to in business. Besides, the business varied. It was nothing like the class of patronage which he had enjoyed in Chicago. He found that it would take a long time to make friends. These people hurried in and out without seeking the pleasures of friendship. It was no gathering or lounging place. Whole days and weeks passed, without one such hearty greeting as he had been wont to enjoy every day in Chicago. </p> 
<p>For another thing, Hurstwood missed the celebrities -- those well-dressed, elite individuals who lend grace to the average bars and bring news from far-off and exclusive circles. He did not see one such in a month. Evenings, when still at his post, he would occasionally read in the evening papers incidents concerning celebrities whom he knew -- whom he had drunk a glass with many a time. They would visit a bar like Fitzgerald and Moy's in Chicago, or the Hoffman House, uptown, but he knew that he would never see them down here. </p> 
<p>Again, the business did not pay as well as he thought. It increased a little, but he found he would have to watch his household expenses, which was humiliating. </p> 
<p>In the very beginning it was a delight to go home late at night, as he did, and find Carrie. He managed to run up and take dinner with her between six and seven, and to remain home until nine o'clock in the morning, but the novelty of this waned after a time, and he began to feel the drag of his duties. </p> 
<p>The first month had scarcely passed before Carrie said in a very natural way: "I think I'll go down this week and buy a dress." </p> 
<p>"What kind?" said Hurstwood. </p> 
<p>"Oh, something for street wear." </p> 
<p>"All right," he answered, smiling, although he noted mentally that it would be more agreeable to his finances if she didn't. Nothing was said about it the next day, but the following morning he asked: </p> 
<p>"Have you done anything about your dress?" </p> 
<p>"Not yet," said Carrie. </p> 
<p>He paused a few moments, as if in thought, and then said: </p> 
<p>"Would you mind putting it off a few days?" </p> 
<p>"No," replied Carrie, who did not catch the drift of his remarks. She had never thought of him in connection with money troubles before. "Why?" </p> 
<p>"Well, I'll tell you," said Hurstwood. "This investment of mine is taking a lot of money just now. I expect to get it all back shortly, but just at present I am running close." </p> 
<p>"Oh!" answered Carrie. "Why, certainly, dear. Why didn't you tell me before?" </p> 
<p>"It wasn't necessary," said Hurstwood. </p> 
<p>For all her acquiescence, there was something about the way Hurstwood spoke which reminded Carrie of Drouet and his little deal which he was always about to put through. It was only the thought of a second, but it was a beginning. It was something new in her thinking of Hurstwood. </p> 
<p>Other things followed from time to time, little things of the same sort, which in their cumulative effect were eventually equal to a full revelation. Carrie was not dull by any means. Two persons cannot long dwell together without coming to an understanding of one another. The mental difficulties of an individual reveal themselves whether he voluntarily confesses them or not. Trouble gets in the air and contributes gloom, which speaks for itself. Hurstwood dressed as nicely as usual, but they were the same clothes he had in Canada. Carrie noticed that he did not install a large wardrobe, though his own was anything but large. She noticed, also, that he did not suggest many amusements, said nothing about the food, seemed concerned about his business. This was not the easy Hurstwood of Chicago -- not the liberal, opulent Hurstwood she had known. The change was too obvious to escape detection. </p> 
<p>In time she began to feel that a change had come about, and that she was not in his confidence. He was evidently secretive and kept his own counsel. She found herself asking him questions about little things. This is a disagreeable state to a woman. Great love makes it seem reasonable, sometimes plausible, but never satisfactory. Where great love is not, a more definite and less satisfactory conclusion is reached. </p> 
<p>As for Hurstwood, he was making a great fight against the difficulties of a changed condition. He was too shrewd not to realise the tremendous mistake he had made, and appreciate that he had done well in getting where he was, and yet he could not help contrasting his present state with his former, hour after hour, and day after day. </p> 
<p>Besides, he had the disagreeable fear of meeting old-time friends, ever since one such encounter which he made shortly after his arrival in the city. It was in Broadway that he saw a man approaching him whom he knew. There was no time for simulating non-recognition. The exchange of glances had been too sharp, the knowledge of each other too apparent. So the friend, a buyer for one of the Chicago wholesale houses, felt, perforce, the necessity of stopping. </p> 
<p>"How are you?" he said, extending his hand with an evident mixture of feeling and a lack of plausible interest. </p> 
<p>"Very well," said Hurstwood, equally embarrassed. "How is it with you?" </p> 
<p>"All right; I'm down here doing a little buying. Are you located here now?" </p> 
<p>"Yes," said Hurstwood, "I have a place down in Warren Street." </p> 
<p>"Is that so?" said the friend. "Glad to hear it. I'll come down and see you." </p> 
<p>"Do," said Hurstwood. </p> 
<p>"So long," said the other, smiling affably and going on. </p> 
<p>"He never asked for my number," thought Hurstwood; "he wouldn't think of coming." He wiped his forehead, which had grown damp, and hoped sincerely he would meet no one else. </p> 
<p>These things told upon his good-nature, such as it was. His one hope was that things would change for the better in a money way. He had Carrie. His furniture was being paid for. He was maintaining his position. As for Carrie, the amusements he could give her would have to do for the present. He could probably keep up his pretensions sufficiently long without exposure to make good, and then all would be well. He failed therein to take account of the frailties of human nature -- the difficulties of matrimonial life. Carrie was young. With him and with her varying mental states were common. At any moment the extremes of feeling might be anti-polarised at the dinner table. This often happens in the best regulated families. Little things brought out on such occasions need great love to obliterate them afterward. Where that is not, both parties count two and two and make a problem after a while.</p>  
<p>像赫斯渥这种年龄和性情的人，是不会轻易受年轻人的种种幻想和炽烈的欲望的影响的，但也缺少年轻人心里如泉水般喷涌而出的希望的力量。这种气氛不会在他心里激起１８岁少年的那种渴望。但是一旦被激起，越是没有希望，就会越加令人痛苦。他不能不注意到来自各方面的富裕和奢侈的种种迹象。他以前来过纽约，了解这里的骄奢淫逸。在某种程度上，对他来说，纽约是个令人敬畏的地方，因为这里集中了他在这个世界上最尊重的东西--财富、地位和名声。在他当经理的那些日子里，和他一起饮过酒的大多数名流，就出身于这个以自我为中心、人口稠密的地方。那些最诱人的有关寻欢作乐和奢侈放荡的故事，讲的就是这里的一些地方和人物。他知道自己确实整天都在不知不觉中和有钱人擦肩而过。在如此富裕的地方，１０万或５０万块钱并不能让人享有过豪华生活的权力。时髦和浮华需要更多的钞票，因此穷人无法生存。现在，当他面对这个城市时，他十分深刻地认识到这一切。这时的他，朋友来往已经断绝，他的那点财产，甚至连名字，都被剥夺了，他不得不从头开始为地位和幸福而奋斗。他还不算老，但他并不迟钝得意识不到自己很快就会变老。于是，眼前这华丽的衣着、地位以及权力，突然间具有了特殊的意义，与他自己的艰难处境相对比，其意义更为重大。 </p> 
<p>他的处境的确艰难。他很快就发现，消除对被捕的恐惧，并不是他生存的必要条件。这种危险已经消失，但下一个需要却成了令人头疼的事。那区区１３００多块钱，要用来对付今后多年的房租、衣食以及娱乐。这样的前景，是不会让一个习惯于一年之内就要花掉５倍于这个数目的钱的人感到心情平静的。他在初到纽约的几天中，就相当积极地考虑了这个问题，决定得赶快行动。因此，他在报纸的广告中寻找着做生意的机会，并开始亲自调查研究。 </p> 
<p>不过这是在他安居下来之后的事。嘉莉和他按照计划去找一套公寓，在靠近阿姆斯特丹大道的七十八街上找到了一套。这是一幢五层楼的建筑，他们的房间是在三楼。因为这条街还没有造满房子，所以向东看得见中央公园的绿树梢，向西看得见赫德森河宽阔的水面，从西面的窗户可以看见一些河上的景象。租用一排六个房间和一个浴室，他们每月得付３５块钱--这在当时只是一般住户的房租，但还是高得吓人。嘉莉注意到这里的房间比芝加哥的小并指出了这一点。 </p> 
<p>“找不到比这更好的了，亲爱的，”赫斯渥说，“除非去找那些老式住宅，不过那样的话，你就没有这些方便的设施了。”嘉莉选中这套新居，是因为它建筑新颖，木建部分色彩鲜亮。这是最新式的建筑之一，装有暖气，这是很大的优点。固定的灶具，冷热水供应，升降送货机，传话筒以及叫门房的铃。 </p> 
<p>这些她都十分喜欢。她很具有家庭主妇的天性，因而对这些设施非常满意。 </p> 
<p>赫斯渥和一家分斯付款的家具店商定，由他们提供全套家具，先付５０块钱定金，以后每月再付１０块钱。然后，他定做了一块小铜牌，刻上“乔·威·惠勒”的姓名，装在过道里他的信箱上。开始嘉莉听到门房叫她惠勒太太时，觉得听起来很怪，但过些时候她听惯了，也就把它当作自己的姓名了。 </p> 
<p>等这些家庭琐事安排妥当之后，赫斯渥就去拜访一些广告上登的能提供做生意的机会的地方，想在市区某家生意兴隆的酒店里买一部分股权。有了在亚当斯街那家华丽的酒店工作的经历，他无法忍受这些登广告的庸俗酒馆。他花了好几天时间去拜访这些酒馆，发现它们都不称心，不过，在交谈中，他倒是学到了不少知识，因为他发现了坦慕尼堂的势力以及和警察拉好关系的重要性。他发现最赚钱、最兴隆的是那些做各种非法生意的场所，而不是费茨杰拉德和莫埃开的那种合法经营的酒店。那些十分赚钱的地方，楼上往往附设优雅的密室和秘密饮酒间。那些大腹便便的店主的衬衫前襟上闪耀着大块的钻石，穿的衣服裁剪合身。他从他们身上看出，这里的卖酒生意和其它地方一样，赢利很高。 </p> 
<p>最后，他找到了一个人，这个人在沃伦街开有一家酒店，似乎是桩大好买卖。酒店看上去不错，而且还可以加以改进。 </p> 
<p>店主声称生意极好，当然，看上去也是如此。 </p> 
<p>“我们这里接待的人都很有教养，”他告诉赫斯渥说，“商人、推销员，还有自由职业者，属于衣冠楚楚的阶层。没有无业游民。我们是不许他们来这里的。"赫斯渥听着现金收入记录机的铃声，观察了一会儿营业状况。 </p> 
<p>“两个人合营也有钱可赚，是吗？”他问。 </p> 
<p>“倘若你对卖酒生意很在行的话，你自己可以看嘛，”店主说。“这只是我开的两家酒店之一。另一家在那边的纳索街上。 </p> 
<p>我一个人照料不了两家。若是能找到一个很懂这行生意的人，我乐意和他合营这一家，让他当经理。”“我有足够的经验，”赫斯渥淡淡地说道，但他没敢提及费莫酒店。 </p> 
<p>“那么，你看着办吧，惠勒先生。”店主说。 </p> 
<p>他只愿意出让１A３的股权、设备和信誉，条件是愿意合股的人要出１０００块钱，而且还要有经营能力。这中间不涉及房产问题，因为这是酒店主人从一个房地产商那里租来用的。 </p> 
<p>这笔交易倒是货真价实。但对赫斯渥来说还有个问题，那就是这种地方的１A３股权，能否每月赢利１５０块钱。他估计他必须要有这个数目，才能维持日常开支并且不显得拮据。可是，为了找到他喜欢的地方，他已经失败了很多次，现在不是犹豫的时候了。看起来１A３股权目前似乎能每月赢利１００块钱。只要经营得当，并加以改进，可能还会多赚一些。因此，他同意合股，并交出他那１０００块钱，准备第二天就职。 </p> 
<p>他起初觉得很是得意，向嘉莉吐露说，他认为自己作出了最好的安排。然而，烦恼的事随着时间的推移出现了。他发现这位合股人很难相处。他常常喝醉酒，酒后脾气很坏。这是生意场上赫斯渥最看不惯的事。此外，生意也变味了。这里的主顾完全不像他在芝加哥时所乐于结交的那一类人。他发现在这里交朋友要花上很长的时间。这些人匆匆而来，又匆匆而去，并不寻求友情的乐趣。这里根本不是聚会或休息的场所。 </p> 
<p>整整几天、几个星期过去了，他没有听到过一声他在芝加哥时习惯了的、每天都能听到的那种亲切的招呼声。 </p> 
<p>另外，赫斯渥想念那些知名人士--那些衣冠楚楚，能使普通酒吧显得体面，并且带来远方的消息和圈子内的新闻的社会名流。他一个月里也没有见到过一个这样的人物。晚上，当还没下班时，他偶尔会从晚报上看到有关他认识的那些知名人士的消息--他曾经多次和这些人在一起喝过酒。他们会去像芝加哥的费莫酒店那样的酒吧，或去住宅区的霍夫曼酒家，但他知道，他绝对不会在这里看见他们。 </p> 
<p>还有，这桩生意也不像他原先想的那样赚钱，赚的钱是稍微多了一点。但是他发现他必须注意节省家庭开支，这很让人难堪。 </p> 
<p>最初，虽然他总是很晚才回家，但能回家并看到嘉莉是一种快乐。他设法在六七点钟之间赶回去和她一起吃晚饭，然后就呆在家里，直到第二天早晨９点。可是过了些时候，这种新鲜感逐渐消失了。他开始感到他的职责成了累赘。 </p> 
<p>第一个月刚过，嘉莉就很自然地说：“我想这个星期去市里买一件衣服。”“买什么样的衣服？”赫斯渥问。 </p> 
<p>“哦，上街穿的。” </p> 
<p>“行埃”他笑着回答，虽然他心里想说，按照他的经济状况，她还是别去买为好。 </p> 
<p>第二天没再说起这事，但是第三天早晨他问道：“你的衣服买了吗？”“还没有，”嘉莉说。 </p> 
<p>他停顿了一会儿，像是在思考着什么，然后说：“推迟几天再买好吗？”“不好，”嘉莉回答，她没有听懂他说这话是什么意思。她以前从未想过他会在钱上遇到麻烦。“为什么呀？”“哦，我告诉你吧，”赫斯渥说。“我这次投资刚刚花了一大笔钱。我想我能很快把它赚回来，可眼前手头还比较紧。”“唉呀！”嘉莉回答，“当然可以，亲爱的。你为什么不早点告诉我呢？”“那时不必要嘛，”赫斯渥说。 </p> 
<p>尽管嘉莉同意了，但是赫斯渥说话的神态，有点使她想起杜洛埃和他总是说就要做成的那笔小生意。这种想法只是一闪而过，但它却开了一个头。它意味着她对赫斯渥有了新的看法。 </p> 
<p>此后又不断地发生了其它一些事情，同样性质的小事情，这些事情累积起来，最终的效果是给人以充分的启示。嘉莉一点也不迟钝。两个人在一起住久了，不可能不逐渐了解对方的。一个人心里有了难处，不管他是否主动地吐露，都要表现出来，烦恼影响神态，使人忧郁，是无法掩饰的。赫斯渥的穿着打扮还和往常一样漂亮，但还是在加拿大时穿的那些衣服。嘉莉注意到他并没有购置大量的衣服，虽然他原有的衣服并不多。她还注意到他不大提起什么娱乐，从不谈论食物，似乎在为他的生意犯愁。这已不是芝加哥的那个自由自在的赫斯渥，不是她过去认识的那个豪放、阔绰的赫斯渥了。变化太明显了，逃不过她的眼睛。 </p> 
<p>过了一些时候，她开始感到又发生了一种变化，他不再向她吐露心事了。显然他在遮遮掩掩，不愿公开自己的想法。她发现，一些小事都得她开口问他。这种状况对女人来说是不愉快的。有了伟大的爱情，它还能显得合理，有时还似乎是可行的，但绝对不是令人满意的。要是没有伟大的爱情，就会得出一个更加明确、更加不令人满意的结论。 </p> 
<p>至于赫斯渥，他正在同新的处境所带来的种种困难进行艰苦的斗争。他非常精明，不可能不意识到自己已经铸成大错，也知道自己能混到现在这样已经很好了，但他还是忍不住要拿他现在的处境和从前相比，每时每刻、日复一日地相比。 </p> 
<p>此外，他还有着一种不愉快的恐惧感，害怕遇到过去的朋友。自从他刚到这个城市不久，有过一次这样的遭遇之后，他就有了这种感觉。那是在百老汇大街上，他看见一个熟人迎面走来。已经来不及假装没看见了。他们已经四目相对，而且显然都认出了对方。于是这位朋友，芝加哥一家批发行的采购员，不得不停了下来。 </p> 
<p>“你好吗？”他说，伸出手来，明显地露出复杂的表情，连一点装出来的关心都没有。 </p> 
<p>“很好，”赫斯渥说，同样地尴尬。“你过得怎么样？”“很好，我来这里采购一些东西。你现在住在这里吗？”“是的，”赫斯渥说，“我在沃伦街开了一家店。”“真的吗？”这位朋友说。“我很高兴听到这个。我会来看你的。”“欢迎你来，”赫斯渥说。 </p> 
<p>“再见，”另一位说，友好地笑了笑，继续赶路。 </p> 
<p>“他连我的门牌号码都不问，”赫斯渥想。“他根本就不想来。”他擦了擦额头，都已经出汗了。他真不希望再遇见其他的熟人。 </p> 
<p>这些事情影响不他原来像是有的好脾气。他只是希望在经济方面的情况能有所好转。他有了嘉莉。家具钱正在付清。 </p> 
<p>他已经开始站住了脚。至于嘉莉，他能给她的娱乐不多，但眼前也只能这样了。他也许可以把自己的假象维持很长的时间而不暴露，直至获得成功，然后一切就都会好起来了。在此，他没有考虑到人性的种种弱点--夫妻生活的种种难处。嘉莉还年轻。双方往往都会有变化无常的心态。随时都有可能带着绝对不同的心情坐在同一张饭桌上。在最为协调的家庭里，也常常会发生这种事。在这类情况下产生的小摩擦，需要伟大的爱情事后来消除。要是没有伟大的爱情，双方都斤斤计较，过些时候就会产生大的问题。</p>
