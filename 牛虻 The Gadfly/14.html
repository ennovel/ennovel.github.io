He was a little annoyed, as a notice of "important business" had been put into the invitation; this cavalier treatment seemed to him almost insolent. Moreover, three separate letters containing bad news arrived during the day, and the wind was in the east, so that Martini felt out of sorts and out of temper; and when, at the group meeting, Dr. Riccardo asked, "Isn't Rivarez here?" he answered rather sulkily: "No; he seems to have got something more interesting on hand, and can't come, or doesn't want to."</p> 
<p>"Really, Martini," said Galli irritably, "you are about the most prejudiced person in Florence. Once you object to a man, everything he does is wrong. How could Rivarez come when he's ill?"</p> 
<p>"Who told you he was ill?"</p> 
<p>"Didn't you know? He's been laid up for the last four days."</p> 
<p>"What's the matter with him?"</p> 
<p>"I don't know. He had to put off an appointment with me on Thursday on account of illness; and last night, when I went round, I heard that he was too ill to see anyone. I thought Riccardo would be looking after him."</p> 
<p>"I knew nothing about it. I'll go round to-night and see if he wants anything."</p> 
<p>The next morning Riccardo, looking very pale and tired, came into Gemma's little study. She was sitting at the table, reading out monotonous strings of figures to Martini, who, with a magnifying glass in one hand and a finely pointed pencil in the other, was making tiny marks in the pages of a book. She made with one hand a gesture requesting silence. Riccardo, knowing that a person who is writing in cipher must not be interrupted, sat down on the sofa behind her and yawned like a man who can hardly keep awake.</p> 
<p>"2, 4; 3, 7; 6, 1; 3, 5; 4&gt; 1;" Gemma's voice went on with machine-like evenness. "8, 4; 7, 2; 5, 1; that finishes the sentence, Cesare."</p> 
<p>She stuck a pin into the paper to mark the exact place, and turned round.</p> 
<p>"Good-morning, doctor; how fagged you look! Are you well?"</p> 
<p>"Oh, I'm well enough--only tired out. I've had an awful night with Rivarez."</p> 
<p>"With Rivarez?"</p> 
<p>"Yes; I've been up with him all night, and now I must go off to my hospital patients. I just came round to know whether you can think of anyone that could look after him a bit for the next few days. He's in a devil of a state. I'll do my best, of course; but I really haven't the time; and he won't hear of my sending in a nurse."</p> 
<p>"What is the matter with him?"</p> 
<p>"Well, rather a complication of things. First of all----"</p> 
<p>"First of all, have you had any breakfast?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, thank you. About Rivarez--no doubt, it's complicated with a lot of nerve trouble; but the main cause of disturbance is an old injury that seems to have been disgracefully neglected. Altogether, he's in a frightfully knocked-about state; I suppose it was that war in South America --and he certainly didn't get proper care when the mischief was done. Probably things were managed in a very rough-and-ready fashion out there; he's lucky to be alive at all. However, there's a chronic tendency to inflammation, and any trifle may bring on an attack----"</p> 
<p>"Is that dangerous?"</p> 
<p>"N-no; the chief danger in a case of that kind is of the patient getting desperate and taking a dose of arsenic."</p> 
<p>"It is very painful, of course?"</p> 
<p>"It's simply horrible; I don't know how he manages to bear it. I was obliged to stupefy him with opium in the night--a thing I hate to do with a nervous patient; but I had to stop it somehow."</p> 
<p>"He is nervous, I should think."</p> 
<p>"Very, but splendidly plucky. As long as he was not actually light-headed with the pain last night, his coolness was quite wonderful. But I had an awful job with him towards the end. How long do you suppose this thing has been going on? Just five nights; and not a soul within call except that stupid landlady, who wouldn't wake if the house tumbled down, and would be no use if she did."</p> 
<p>"But what about the ballet-girl?"</p> 
<p>"Yes; isn't that a curious thing? He won't let her come near him. He has a morbid horror of her. Altogether, he's one of the most incomprehensible creatures I ever met--a perfect mass of contradictions."</p> 
<p>He took out his watch and looked at it with a preoccupied face. "I shall be late at the hospital; but it can't be helped. The junior will have to begin without me for once. I wish I had known of all this before--it ought not to have been let go on that way night after night."</p> 
<p>"But why on earth didn't he send to say he was ill?" Martini interrupted. "He might have guessed we shouldn't have left him stranded in that fashion."</p> 
<p>"I wish, doctor," said Gemma, "that you had sent for one of us last night, instead of wearing yourself out like this."</p> 
<p>"My dear lady, I wanted to send round to Galli; but Rivarez got so frantic at the suggestion that I didn't dare attempt it. When I asked him whether there was anyone else he would like fetched, he looked at me for a minute, as if he were scared out of his wits, and then put up both hands to his eyes and said: 'Don't tell them; they will laugh!' He seemed quite possessed with some fancy about people laughing at something. I couldn't make out what; he kept talking Spanish; but patients do say the oddest things sometimes."</p> 
<p>"Who is with him now?" asked Gemma.</p> 
<p>"No one except the landlady and her maid."</p> 
<p>"I'll go to him at once," said Martini.</p> 
<p>"Thank you. I'll look round again in the evening. You'll find a paper of written directions in the table-drawer by the large window, and the opium is on the shelf in the next room. If the pain comes on again, give him another dose--not more than one; but don't leave the bottle where he can get at it, whatever you do; he might be tempted to take too much."</p> 
<p>When Martini entered the darkened room, the Gadfly turned his head round quickly, and, holding out to him a burning hand, began, in a bad imitation of his usual flippant manner:</p> 
<p>"Ah, Martini! You have come to rout me out about those proofs. It's no use swearing at me for missing the committee last night; the fact is, I have not been quite well, and----"</p> 
<p>"Never mind the committee. I have just seen Riccardo, and have come to know if I can be of any use."</p> 
<p>The Gadfly set his face like a flint.</p> 
<p>"Oh, really! that is very kind of you; but it wasn't worth the trouble. I'm only a little out of sorts."</p> 
<p>"So I understood from Riccardo. He was up with you all night, I believe."</p> 
<p>The Gadfly bit his lip savagely.</p> 
<p>"I am quite comfortable, thank you, and don't want anything."</p> 
<p>"Very well; then I will sit in the other room; perhaps you would rather be alone. I will leave the door ajar, in case you call me."</p> 
<p>"Please don't trouble about it; I really shan't want anything. I should be wasting your time for nothing."</p> 
<p>"Nonsense, man!" Martini broke in roughly. "What's the use of trying to fool me that way? Do you think I have no eyes? Lie still and go to sleep, if you can."</p> 
<p>He went into the adjoining room, and, leaving the door open, sat down with a book. Presently he heard the Gadfly move restlessly two or three times. He put down his book and listened. There was a short silence, then another restless movement; then the quick, heavy, panting breath of a man clenching his teeth to suppress a groan. He went back into the room.</p> 
<p>"Can I do anything for you, Rivarez?"</p> 
<p>There was no answer, and he crossed the room to the bed-side. The Gadfly, with a ghastly, livid face, looked at him for a moment, and silently shook his head.</p> 
<p>"Shall I give you some more opium? Riccardo said you were to have it if the pain got very bad."</p> 
<p>"No, thank you; I can bear it a bit longer. It may be worse later on."</p> 
<p>Martini shrugged his shoulders and sat down beside the bed. For an interminable hour he watched in silence; then he rose and fetched the opium.</p> 
<p>"Rivarez, I won't let this go on any longer; if you can stand it, I can't. You must have the stuff."</p> 
<p>The Gadfly took it without speaking. Then he turned away and closed his eyes. Martini sat down again, and listened as the breathing became gradually deep and even.</p> 
<p>The Gadfly was too much exhausted to wake easily when once asleep. Hour after hour he lay absolutely motionless. Martini approached him several times during the day and evening, and looked at the still figure; but, except the breathing, there was no sign of life. The face was so wan and colourless that at last a sudden fear seized upon him; what if he had given too much opium? The injured left arm lay on the coverlet, and he shook it gently to rouse the sleeper. As he did so, the unfastened sleeve fell back, showing a series of deep and fearful scars covering the arm from wrist to elbow.</p> 
<p>"That arm must have been in a pleasant condition when those marks were fresh," said Riccardo's voice behind him.</p> 
<p>"Ah, there you are at last! Look here, Riccardo; ought this man to sleep forever? I gave him a dose about ten hours ago, and he hasn't moved a muscle since."</p> 
<p>Riccardo stooped down and listened for a moment.</p> 
<p>"No; he is breathing quite properly; it's nothing but sheer exhaustion--what you might expect after such a night. There may be another paroxysm before morning. Someone will sit up, I hope?"</p> 
<p>"Galli will; he has sent to say he will be here by ten."</p> 
<p>"It's nearly that now. Ah, he's waking! Just see the maidservant gets that broth hot. Gently --gently, Rivarez! There, there, you needn't fight, man; I'm not a bishop!"</p> 
<p>The Gadfly started up with a shrinking, scared look. "Is it my turn?" he said hurriedly in Spanish. "Keep the people amused a minute; I---- Ah! I didn't see you, Riccardo."</p> 
<p>He looked round the room and drew one hand across his forehead as if bewildered. "Martini! Why, I thought you had gone away. I must have been asleep."</p> 
<p>"You have been sleeping like the beauty in the fairy story for the last ten hours; and now you are to have some broth and go to sleep again."</p> 
<p>"Ten hours! Martini, surely you haven't been here all that time?"</p> 
<p>"Yes; I was beginning to wonder whether I hadn't given you an overdose of opium."</p> 
<p>The Gadfly shot a sly glance at him.</p> 
<p>"No such luck! Wouldn't you have nice quiet committee-meetings? What the devil do you want, Riccardo? Do for mercy's sake leave me in peace, can't you? I hate being mauled about by doctors."</p> 
<p>"Well then, drink this and I'll leave you in peace. I shall come round in a day or two, though, and give you a thorough overhauling. I think you have pulled through the worst of this business now; you don't look quite so much like a death's head at a feast."</p> 
<p>"Oh, I shall be all right soon, thanks. Who's that--Galli? I seem to have a collection of all the graces here to-night."</p> 
<p>"I have come to stop the night with you."</p> 
<p>"Nonsense! I don't want anyone. Go home, all the lot of you. Even if the thing should come on again, you can't help me; I won't keep taking opium. It's all very well once in a way."</p> 
<p>"I'm afraid you're right," Riccardo said. "But that's not always an easy resolution to stick to."</p> 
<p>The Gadfly looked up, smiling. "No fear! If I'd been going in for that sort of thing, I should have done it long ago."</p> 
<p>"Anyway, you are not going to be left alone," Riccardo answered drily. "Come into the other room a minute, Galli; I want to speak to you. Good-night, Rivarez; I'll look in to-morrow."</p> 
<p>Martini was following them out of the room when he heard his name softly called. The Gadfly was holding out a hand to him.</p> 
<p>"Thank you!"</p> 
<p>"Oh, stuff! Go to sleep."</p> 
<p>When Riccardo had gone, Martini remained a few minutes in the outer room, talking with Galli. As he opened the front door of the house he heard a carriage stop at the garden gate and saw a woman's figure get out and come up the path. It was Zita, returning, evidently, from some evening entertainment. He lifted his hat and stood aside to let her pass, then went out into the dark lane leading from the house to the Poggio Imperiale. Presently the gate clicked and rapid footsteps came down the lane.</p> 
<p>"Wait a minute!" she said.</p> 
<p>When he turned back to meet her she stopped short, and then came slowly towards him, dragging one hand after her along the hedge. There was a single street-lamp at the corner, and he saw by its light that she was hanging her head down as though embarrassed or ashamed.</p> 
<p>"How is he?" she asked without looking up.</p> 
<p>"Much better than he was this morning. He has been asleep most of the day and seems less exhausted. I think the attack is passing over."</p> 
<p>She still kept her eyes on the ground.</p> 
<p>"Has it been very bad this time?"</p> 
<p>"About as bad as it can well be, I should think."</p> 
<p>"I thought so. When he won't let me come into the room, that always means it's bad."</p> 
<p>"Does he often have attacks like this?"</p> 
<p>"That depends---- It's so irregular. Last summer, in Switzerland, he was quite well; but the winter before, when we were in Vienna, it was awful. He wouldn't let me come near him for days together. He hates to have me about when he's ill."</p> 
<p>She glanced up for a moment, and, dropping her eyes again, went on:</p> 
<p>"He always used to send me off to a ball, or concert, or something, on one pretext or another, when he felt it coming on. Then he would lock himself into his room. I used to slip back and sit outside the door--he would have been furious if he'd known. He'd let the dog come in if it whined, but not me. He cares more for it, I think."</p> 
<p>There was a curious, sullen defiance in her manner.</p> 
<p>"Well, I hope it won't be so bad any more," said Martini kindly. "Dr. Riccardo is taking the case seriously in hand. Perhaps he will be able to make a permanent improvement. And, in any case, the treatment gives relief at the moment. But you had better send to us at once, another time. He would have suffered very much less if we had known of it earlier. Good-night!"</p> 
<p>He held out his hand, but she drew back with a quick gesture of refusal.</p> 
<p>"I don't see why you want to shake hands with his mistress."</p> 
<p>"As you like, of course," he began in embarrassment.</p> 
<p>She stamped her foot on the ground. "I hate you!" she cried, turning on him with eyes like glowing coals. "I hate you all! You come here talking politics to him; and he lets you sit up the night with him and give him things to stop the pain, and I daren't so much as peep at him through the door! What is he to you? What right have you to come and steal him away from me? I hate you! I hate you! I HATE you!"</p> 
<p>She burst into a violent fit of sobbing, and, darting back into the garden, slammed the gate in his face.</p> 
<p>"Good Heavens!" said Martini to himself, as he walked down the lane. "That girl is actually in love with him! Of all the extraordinary things----"</p> 
<p>一月份第一个星期的一天，马尔蒂尼发出了请柬，邀请大家参加文学委员会的月会。他收到了牛虻的一张短笺，上面用铅笔潦草地写着：“很抱歉，不能前来。”他感到有点懊恼，因为请柬注明了“要事”。在他看来，这个家伙一贯桀骜不驯，这样做真是无礼至极。此外，他那天分别收到了三封信，全都是坏消息。而且天上又刮着东风，所以马尔蒂尼感到很不高兴，脾气极坏。开会的时候，里卡尔多医生问道：“里瓦雷兹到了吗？”他绷着脸回答：“没有，他好像忙着某件更加有趣的事情，不能来也不想来。”</p> 
<p>“真的，马尔蒂尼，”加利气愤地说道，“你大概就是佛罗伦萨成见最大的人了。一旦你反对某个人，他做的一切都是错的。他病了还怎么来？”</p> 
<p>“谁告诉你他病了？”</p> 
<p>“你不知道吗？他已经卧床四天了。”</p> 
<p>“他怎么啦？”</p> 
<p>“我不知道。我们原来约好在星期三见面，因为生病他只得取消了这次约会。昨晚我去了他那里，我听说他病得太重，谁都不能见。我还以为里卡尔多会照顾他呢。”</p> 
<p>“我一无所知。我今晚就过去，看看他想要什么。”</p> 
<p>第二天早晨，里卡尔多走进了琼玛的小书房，他那苍白的脸上满是倦容。她坐在桌边，正向马尔蒂尼口述一串串单调的数字。她做了一个手势，要他不要说话。里卡尔多知道书写密码时不能被人打断，所以他坐在沙发上，呵欠连天，像是困得睁不开眼睛。</p> 
<p>“２，４；３，７；６，１；３，５；４，１；”琼玛的声音就像机器一样平缓，“８，４；７，２；５，１；这个句子完了，塞萨雷。”</p> 
<p>她用针在纸上戳了一个洞，以便记住确切的位置。然后她转了过来。</p> 
<p>“早安，医生。你看上去可是一脸倦容！你身体好吗？”</p> 
<p>“噢，我身体还好——只是累得要命。我陪着里瓦雷兹熬了一夜。”</p> 
<p>“陪着里瓦雷兹？”</p> 
<p>“是啊，我陪了他一整夜，现在我必须回医院，照顾我那些病人。我过来看看你能否找到一个人去照顾他几天。他病得挺重。我当然会尽力而为，但是我没有时间。而且他又不让我派个护士去。”</p> 
<p>“他得了什么病？”</p> 
<p>“呃，病情相当复杂。首先——”</p> 
<p>“首先你吃饭了没有？”</p> 
<p>“吃了，谢谢。关于里瓦雷兹——无疑他的病情是因为受到很多神经刺激，但是主要原因是旧伤复发，好像当初治疗得非常草率。总而言之，他的身体是垮了，情况十分可怕。我看是南美那场战争——他在受伤以后肯定没有得到适当的治疗，可能就地胡乱地处理了一下。他能活下来就算万幸。可是伤势趋于慢性发炎，任何小的刺激都能引起旧病复发——”</p> 
<p>“危险吗？”</p> 
<p>“不、不，主要的危险是病人陷入绝望，并且吞服砒霜。”</p> 
<p>“当然是非常痛苦了？”</p> 
<p>“简直可怕极了。我不知道他怎么能够忍受。晚上我被迫给他服了一剂鸦片，以便麻木他的神经——这种东西我是不喜欢给一位神经质的病人服的，但是我没有办法。”</p> 
<p>“他有点神经质，我看他应该是吧。”</p> 
<p>“非常神经质，但是确也勇气过人。昨晚只要他不是真的疼得头晕目眩，他就显得镇静自若，着实让人感到惊奇。但是最后我也忙得够呛。你们以为他这样病了多长时间？正好五夜，除了那位傻乎乎的女房东，叫不到任何人。就是房子坍塌下来，房东也不会醒来。即使她醒了过来，她也派不上用场。”</p> 
<p>“但是那位跳芭蕾舞的姑娘呢？”</p> 
<p>“是啊，这不是怪事吗？他不让她到他跟前去。他极其厌恶她。总而言之，在我见过的人当中，他最让人感到不可理解——完全是一团矛盾。”</p> 
<p>他取出了手表，全神贯注地看着。“到医院去要迟到了，但也没有办法。我的助手只得独自开诊了。我希望我能早点知道这事——不该那样强自撑着，一夜接着一夜。”</p> 
<p>“但是他为什么不派人过来说他生病了呢？”马尔蒂尼打断了他的话。“他总该知道他病成了那样，我们不会置之不理的。”</p> 
<p>“我希望，医生，”琼玛说道，“昨天晚上你叫上我们一个人，那就不会把你累成了这样。”</p> 
<p>“我亲爱的女士，我想到了去叫加利，但是里瓦雷兹听了我的建议暴跳如雷，所以我就不敢派人去叫了。当我问他想把谁叫来时，他看了我一会儿，仿佛是被惊呆了。然后他用双手掩住眼睛，并说：‘别告诉他们，他们会笑话的！’他好像受困于某种幻想，觉得人家会笑话什么。我搞不清是什么，他老是讲西班牙语。话又说回来，有时病人总会说些奇怪的东西。”</p> 
<p>“现在谁在陪他？”琼玛问道。</p> 
<p>“除了女房东和她的女佣，没有别的人。”</p> 
<p>“我立即就去，”马尔蒂尼说道。</p> 
<p>“谢谢你。我天黑以后还会过去。靠近那扇大窗户有张桌子，你会在抽屉里发现一张写好的医嘱。鸦片就在隔壁房间的书架上。如果病痛又发作了，就给他服一剂——只能服一剂。但是别把瓶子放在他能拿到的地方，不管你做什么。他也许会禁不住诱惑，服下过量的药。”</p> 
<p>当马尔蒂尼走进那间阴暗的屋子时，牛虻迅速转过头来，并且伸出一只发烫的手。他又开始模仿往常那种轻率的态度，只是模仿得很拙劣。</p> 
<p>“啊，马尔蒂尼！你来催我交出那些清样吧。你不用骂我，昨晚的会我不就是没去参加嘛。事实上我的身体不大好，而且——”</p> 
<p>“别管开会了。我刚见过里卡尔多，过来看看能否帮上一点忙。”</p> 
<p>牛虻把脸绷得就像是一块燧石。</p> 
<p>“噢，真的！你也太客气了，但是犯不着这么麻烦。我只是有点不大舒服。”</p> 
<p>“里卡尔多把一切都跟我说了。我相信他昨晚陪了你一夜。”</p> 
<p>牛虻使劲咬着嘴唇。</p> 
<p>“我挺好的，谢谢你。我什么也不要。”</p> 
<p>“很好，那么我就坐在隔壁的房间。也许你会觉得非常孤单。我就把房门虚掩着，以防你叫我。”</p> 
<p>“你就别麻烦了，我真的什么也不要。我会白白浪费你的时间。”</p> 
<p>“伙计，你就不要胡说八道了！”马尔蒂尼粗暴地打断了他的话。“这样骗我有什么用？你以为我没长眼睛吗？你就尽量躺下睡觉吧。”</p> 
<p>他走进隔壁的房间，把房门虚掩着，拿着一本书坐了下来。他很快就听到牛虻烦躁不安地动了两三次。他放下了书，侧耳倾听。出现短暂的寂静，然后又烦躁不安地动了一下。然后喘着粗气，呼吸急促，他显然是在咬紧牙关，不让自己哼出声来。他走回那间屋子。</p> 
<p>“里瓦雷兹，需要我做点什么吗？”</p> 
<p>没有回答，他走到了床边。牛虻脸色发青，像个死人一样。他看了牛虻一会儿，然后默不做声地摇了摇头。</p> 
<p>“要我给你再来点鸦片吗？里卡尔多说如果疼得厉害，你就服一剂。”</p> 
<p>“不，谢尉。我还能挺一会儿。回头也许会疼得更厉害。”</p> 
<p>马尔蒂尼耸了耸肩膀，然后坐在床边。他默默地望着，过了漫长的一个小时，他起身拿来鸦片。</p> 
<p>“里瓦雷兹，我再也看不下去了。如果你能挺住，我可挺不住。你一定要服下这东西。”</p> 
<p>牛虻一句话也没说就把它服下去了。然后他转过身去，闭上了眼睛。马尔蒂尼又坐了下来，听到呼吸声逐渐变得沉重而又均匀。</p> 
<p>牛虻太累了，一旦睡着了就难以轻易醒来。一个小时过去了，又一个小时过去了，他躺在那里一动也不动。在白天和黑夜里，马尔蒂尼好几次走到他跟前，看望这个平静的身躯。但是除了呼吸以外，丝毫看不出他还活着。脸上那么苍白，没有一点血色。最后他突然感到害怕起来，要是给他服了太多的鸦片该怎么办？那只受伤的左臂放在被面上，他轻轻地摇了摇这只胳膊，试图把他叫醒。在他摇的时候，没有扣上扣子的袖子褪了下去，露出多处深深的疤痕，从手腕到胳膊肘全都是这些可怕的疤痕。</p> 
<p>“刚刚落下这些伤口时，这只胳膊一定好看得很。”里卡尔多的声音在后面响了起来。</p> 
<p>“啊，你总算来了！瞧瞧这儿，里卡尔多。这人不会长眠不醒吧？我还是在十个小时之前给他服了一剂，自那以后他就没动过。”</p> 
<p>里卡尔多弯腰听了一会儿。</p> 
<p>“不会，他的呼吸十分正常。只是累了——撑了一夜，他是顶不住了。天亮之前还会发作一次。我希望有个人彻夜守着。”</p> 
<p>“加利会来守夜，他已经派人捎了话，说他要在十点过来。”</p> 
<p>“现在快到了。啊，他醒了！看看佣人把水烧热了没有。轻点——轻点，里瓦雷兹！行了，行了，你不用跟谁斗了，伙计。我可不是主教！”</p> 
<p>牛虻突然惊醒了，露出畏缩、害怕的表情。“轮到我了吗？”</p> 
<p>他用西班牙语急忙说道。“再让他们乐一会儿。我——噢！我没有看见你，里卡尔多。”</p> 
<p>他环视房间，把手搭在额头上，好像有些茫然。“马尔蒂尼！噢，我还以为你已走了。我一定睡着了。”</p> 
<p>“你睡了十个小时，就像神话中的睡美人一样。现在你要喝些肉汤，然后接着再睡。”</p> 
<p>“十个小时！马尔蒂尼，你肯定不是一直在这儿吧？”</p> 
<p>“我一直都在这儿，我开始纳闷是否该给你服鸦片。”</p> 
<p>牛虻有点不好意思地看了他一眼。</p> 
<p>“不会那么走运的！那样委员会在开会时不就安静了吗？里卡尔多，你究竟想干什么？你就不能慈悲为怀，让我清静一下吗？我就讨厌被医生折腾。”</p> 
<p>“那好，喝下这个，然后我就走开，让你清静一下。可是过一两天，我还是要来，准备给你彻底检查一下。我看现在你已经过了危险期。你看来不像是盛宴上的骷髅头。”</p> 
<p>“噢，我很快就会没事的，谢谢。那是谁——加利吗？今晚我这儿好像是宾客盈门。”</p> 
<p>“我过来是陪你过夜的。”</p> 
<p>“胡说八道！谁我也不要。回去，你们都走，即使还会发作，你们也帮不了我的忙。我不会服鸦片了。偶然服一下倒是挺管用的。”</p> 
<p>“恐怕你说得对，”里卡尔多说，“但是坚持不服可不那么容易。”</p> 
<p>牛虻抬头微微一笑。“别担心！如果我会对那东西上瘾，我早就上瘾了。”</p> 
<p>“反正不会让你一个人待在这儿，”里卡尔多干巴巴地说道，“加利，到另一个房间去一会儿，我想跟你说句话。晚安，里瓦雷兹。我明天会过来的。”</p> 
<p>马尔蒂尼跟着他们走出房间，这时他听到牛虻叫他的名字。牛虻朝他伸出了一只手。</p> 
<p>“谢谢你！”</p> 
<p>“噢，别废话！睡吧。”</p> 
<p>当里卡尔多走了以后，马尔蒂尼又在外间和加利聊了几分钟。当他推开房屋的前门时，他听到一辆马车停在花园门口，并且看见一个女人的身影下了车，沿着小道走了过来。这是绮达，她晚上显然是上哪儿玩去了，这会儿刚回来。他举起了帽子，站在一旁等她过去，然后走进通往帝国山的那条黑暗的小巷。随后花园的大门咔嗒响了一下，急促的脚步迈向小巷这边。</p> 
<p>“等一等！”她说。</p> 
<p>当他转身面对她时，她停下了脚步，然后沿着篱笆缓慢地朝他走来，一只手背在后面。拐角的地方只有一盏路灯，他在灯下看见她垂着头，仿佛有些窘迫或者害臊。</p> 
<p>“他怎么样？”她问，头也没抬一下。</p> 
<p>“比今天早上好多了。他几乎睡了一天，好像不那么累了。我看他已脱离了险境。”</p> 
<p>她仍然盯着地面。</p> 
<p>“这次很厉害吧？”</p> 
<p>“我看是够厉害的。”</p> 
<p>“我想也是。当他不愿让我进屋时，那就总是很厉害。”</p> 
<p>“他常这样发作吗？”</p> 
<p>“也不一定——没有什么规律。去年夏天在瑞士他就很好，但是在这以前，冬天我们在维也纳时，情况就很糟。好几天他都不让我靠近他。他在生病时讨厌我在他的身边。”</p> 
<p>她抬头看了一会儿，然后又垂下了眼睛，接着说道：“他感到病情将要发作时，总是打发我去跳舞，或者去听音乐会，或者去干别的什么，借口这个借口那个。然后他会把自己锁在屋里。我时常溜回来，坐在门外——如果他知道了，他会大发雷霆的。如果狗叫，他会把它放进去，但是他不会放我进去。我看他对狗倒更关心吧。”</p> 
<p>她的态度挺怪，好像气不打一处来。</p> 
<p>“呃，我希望病情再也不会恶化了，”马尔蒂尼和颜悦色地说，“里卡尔多医生对他的病情认真负责，也许能够把他彻底治好。不管怎样，这次治疗目前已使病情得到缓解。但是下一次你最好还是立即派人去找我们。如果我们早点知道，他也不会吃那么大的苦。晚安！”</p> 
<p>他伸出了手，但是她随即后退，表示拒绝。</p> 
<p>“我看不出你为什么想和他的情妇握手。”</p> 
<p>“当然随你的便了。”他不无尴尬地说。</p> 
<p>她一跺脚。“我讨厌你们！”她冲他叫道，眼睛就像是烧红的煤炭。“我讨厌你们所有的人！你们到这儿来和他大谈政治，他让你们彻夜守着他，给他吃止痛的东西，可我却不敢从门缝中看他一眼！他是你们的什么人？你们有什么权利到这儿来，把他从我身边偷走？我讨厌你们！我讨厌你们！”</p> 
<p>她猛然抽泣起来，重又冲进花园，当着他的面使劲关上大门。</p> 
<p>“我的天啊！”在朝小巷那头走去时，马尔蒂尼自言自语地说道。“这位姑娘真的爱他！真是怪事——”</p>
