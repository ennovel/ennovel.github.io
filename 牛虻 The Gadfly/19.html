When the arms had been safely smuggled into Papal territory there remained a still more difficult and dangerous task: that of conveying them unobserved from the secret stores in the mountain caverns and ravines to the various local centres and thence to the separate villages. The whole district was swarming with spies; and Domenichino, to whom the Gadfly had intrusted the ammunition, sent into Florence a messenger with an urgent appeal for either help or extra time. The Gadfly had insisted that the work should be finished by the middle of June; and what with the difficulty of conveying heavy transports over bad roads, and the endless hindrances and delays caused by the necessity of continually evading observation, Domenichino was growing desperate. "I am between Scylla and Charybdis," he wrote. "I dare not work quickly, for fear of detection, and I must not work slowly if we are to be ready in time. Either send me efficient help at once, or let the Venetians know that we shall not be ready till the first week in July."</p> 
<p>The Gadfly carried the letter to Gemma and, while she read it, sat frowning at the floor and stroking the cat's fur the wrong way.</p> 
<p>"This is bad," she said. "We can hardly keep the Venetians waiting for three weeks."</p> 
<p>"Of course we can't; the thing is absurd. Domenichino m-might unders-s-stand that. We must follow the lead of the Venetians, not they ours."</p> 
<p>"I don't see that Domenichino is to blame; he has evidently done his best, and he can't do impossibilities."</p> 
<p>"It's not in Domenichino that the fault lies; it's in the fact of his being one person instead of two. We ought to have at least one responsible man to guard the store and another to see the transports off. He is quite right; he must have efficient help."</p> 
<p>"But what help are we going to give him? We have no one in Florence to send."</p> 
<p>"Then I m-must go myself."</p> 
<p>She leaned back in her chair and looked at him with a little frown.</p> 
<p>"No, that won't do; it's too risky."</p> 
<p>"It will have to do if we can't f-f-find any other way out of the difficulty."</p> 
<p>"Then we must find another way, that's all. It's out of the question for you to go again just now."</p> 
<p>An obstinate line appeared at the corners of his under lip.</p> 
<p>"I d-don't see that it's out of the question."</p> 
<p>"You will see if you think about the thing calmly for a minute. It is only five weeks since you got back; the police are on the scent about that pilgrim business, and scouring the country to find a clue. Yes, I know you are clever at disguises; but remember what a lot of people saw you, both as Diego and as the countryman; and you can't disguise your lameness or the scar on your face."</p> 
<p>"There are p-plenty of lame people in the world."</p> 
<p>"Yes, but there are not plenty of people in the Romagna with a lame foot and a sabre-cut across the cheek and a left arm injured like yours, and the combination of blue eyes with such dark colouring."</p> 
<p>"The eyes don't matter; I can alter them with belladonna."</p> 
<p>"You can't alter the other things. No, it won't do. For you to go there just now, with all your identification-marks, would be to walk into a trap with your eyes open. You would certainly be taken."</p> 
<p>"But s-s-someone must help Domenichino."</p> 
<p>"It will be no help to him to have you caught at a critical moment like this. Your arrest would mean the failure of the whole thing."</p> 
<p>But the Gadfly was difficult to convince, and the discussion went on and on without coming nearer to any settlement. Gemma was beginning to realize how nearly inexhaustible was the fund of quiet obstinacy in his character; and, had the matter not been one about which she felt strongly, she would probably have yielded for the sake of peace. This, however, was a case in which she could not conscientiously give way; the practical advantage to be gained from the proposed journey seemed to her not sufficiently important to be worth the risk, and she could not help suspecting that his desire to go was prompted less by a conviction of grave political necessity than by a morbid craving for the excitement of danger. He had got into the habit of risking his neck, and his tendency to run into unnecessary peril seemed to her a form of intemperance which should be quietly but steadily resisted. Finding all her arguments unavailing against his dogged resolve to go his own way, she fired her last shot.</p> 
<p>"Let us be honest about it, anyway," she said; "and call things by their true names. It is not Domenichino's difficulty that makes you so determined to go. It is your own personal passion for----"</p> 
<p>"It's not true!" he interrupted vehemently. "He is nothing to me; I don't care if I never see him again."</p> 
<p>He broke off, seeing in her face that he had betrayed himself. Their eyes met for an instant, and dropped; and neither of them uttered the name that was in both their minds.</p> 
<p>"It--it is not Domenichino I want to save," he stammered at last, with his face half buried in the cat's fur; "it is that I--I understand the danger of the work failing if he has no help."</p> 
<p>She passed over the feeble little subterfuge, and went on as if there had been no interruption:</p> 
<p>"It is your passion for running into danger which makes you want to go there. You have the same craving for danger when you are worried that you had for opium when you were ill."</p> 
<p>"It was not I that asked for the opium," he said defiantly; "it was the others who insisted on giving it to me."</p> 
<p>"I dare say. You plume yourself a little on your stoicism, and to ask for physical relief would have hurt your pride; but it is rather flattered than otherwise when you risk your life to relieve the irritation of your nerves. And yet, after all, the distinction is a merely conventional one."</p> 
<p>He drew the cat's head back and looked down into the round, green eyes. "Is it true, Pasht?" he said. "Are all these unkind things true that your mistress is s-saying about me? Is it a case of mea culpa; mea m-maxima culpa? You wise beast, you never ask for opium, do you? Your ancestors were gods in Egypt, and no man t-trod on their tails. I wonder, though, what would become of your calm superiority to earthly ills if I were to take this paw of yours and hold it in the c-candle. Would you ask me for opium then? Would you? Or perhaps--for death? No, pussy, we have no right to die for our personal convenience. We may spit and s-swear a bit, if it consoles us; but we mustn't pull the paw away."</p> 
<p>"Hush!" She took the cat off his knee and put it down on a footstool. "You and I will have time for thinking about those things later on. What we have to think of now is how to get Domenichino out of his difficulty. What is it, Katie; a visitor? I am busy."</p> 
<p>"Miss Wright has sent you this, ma'am, by hand."</p> 
<p>The packet, which was carefully sealed, contained a letter, addressed to Miss Wright, but unopened and with a Papal stamp. Gemma's old school friends still lived in Florence, and her more important letters were often received, for safety, at their address.</p> 
<p>"It is Michele's mark," she said, glancing quickly over the letter, which seemed to be about the summer-terms at a boarding house in the Apennines, and pointing to two little blots on a corner of the page. "It is in chemical ink; the reagent is in the third drawer of the writing-table. Yes; that is it."</p> 
<p>He laid the letter open on the desk and passed a little brush over its pages. When the real message stood out on the paper in a brilliant blue line, he leaned back in his chair and burst out laughing.</p> 
<p>"What is it?" she asked hurriedly. He handed her the paper.</p> 
<p>"DOMENICHINO HAS BEEN ARRESTED. COME AT ONCE."</p> 
<p>She sat down with the paper in her hand and stared hopelessly at the Gadfly.</p> 
<p>"W-well?" he said at last, with his soft, ironical drawl; "are you satisfied now that I must go?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, I suppose you must," she answered, sighing. "And I too."</p> 
<p>He looked up with a little start. "You too? But----"</p> 
<p>"Of course. It will be very awkward, I know, to be left without anyone here in Florence; but everything must go to the wall now except the providing of an extra pair of hands."</p> 
<p>"There are plenty of hands to be got there."</p> 
<p>"They don't belong to people whom you can trust thoroughly, though. You said yourself just now that there must be two responsible persons in charge; and if Domenichino couldn't manage alone it is evidently impossible for you to do so. A person as desperately compromised as you are is very much handicapped, remember, in work of that kind, and more dependent on help than anyone else would be. Instead of you and Domenichino, it must be you and I."</p> 
<p>He considered for a moment, frowning.</p> 
<p>"Yes, you are quite right," he said; "and the sooner we go the better. But we must not start together. If I go off to-night, you can take, say, the afternoon coach to-morrow."</p> 
<p>"Where to?"</p> 
<p>"That we must discuss. I think I had b-b-better go straight in to Faenza. If I start late to-night and ride to Borgo San Lorenzo I can get my disguise arranged there and go straight on."</p> 
<p>"I don't see what else we can do," she said, with an anxious little frown; "but it is very risky, your going off in such a hurry and trusting to the smugglers finding you a disguise at Borgo. You ought to have at least three clear days to double on your trace before you cross the frontier."</p> 
<p>"You needn't be afraid," he answered, smiling; "I may get taken further on, but not at the frontier. Once in the hills I am as safe as here; there's not a smuggler in the Apennines that would betray me. What I am not quite sure about is how you are to get across."</p> 
<p>"Oh, that is very simple! I shall take Louisa Wright's passport and go for a holiday. No one knows me in the Romagna, but every spy knows you."</p> 
<p>"F-fortunately, so does every smuggler."</p> 
<p>She took out her watch.</p> 
<p>"Half-past two. We have the afternoon and evening, then, if you are to start to-night."</p> 
<p>"Then the best thing will be for me to go home and settle everything now, and arrange about a good horse. I shall ride in to San Lorenzo; it will be safer."</p> 
<p>"But it won't be safe at all to hire a horse. The owner will-----"</p> 
<p>"I shan't hire one. I know a man that will lend me a horse, and that can be trusted. He has done things for me before. One of the shepherds will bring it back in a fortnight. I shall be here again by five or half-past, then; and while I am gone, I w-want you to go and find Martini and exp-plain everything to him."</p> 
<p>"Martini!" She turned round and looked at him in astonishment.</p> 
<p>"Yes; we must take him into confidence--unless you can think of anyone else."</p> 
<p>"I don't quite understand what you mean."</p> 
<p>"We must have someone here whom we can trust, in case of any special difficulty; and of all the set here Martini is the man in whom I have most confidence. Riccardo would do anything he could for us, of course; but I think Martini has a steadier head. Still, you know him better than I do; it is as you think."</p> 
<p>"I have not the slightest doubt as to Martini's trustworthiness and efficiency in every respect; and I think he would probably consent to give us any help he could. But----"</p> 
<p>He understood at once.</p> 
<p>"Gemma, what would you feel if you found out that a comrade in bitter need had not asked you for help you might have given, for fear of hurting or distressing you? Would you say there was any true kindness in that?"</p> 
<p>"Very well," she said, after a little pause; "I will send Katie round at once and ask him to come; and while she is gone I will go to Louisa for her passport; she promised to lend it whenever I want one. What about money? Shall I draw some out of the bank?"</p> 
<p>"No; don't waste time on that; I can draw enough from my account to last us for a bit. We will fall back on yours later on if my balance runs short. Till half-past five, then; I shall be sure to find you here, of course?"</p> 
<p>"Oh, yes! I shall be back long before then."</p> 
<p>Half an hour after the appointed time he returned, and found Gemma and Martini sitting on the terrace together. He saw at once that their conversation had been a distressing one; the traces of agitation were visible in both of them, and Martini was unusually silent and glum.</p> 
<p>"Have you arranged everything?" she asked, looking up.</p> 
<p>"Yes; and I have brought you some money for the journey. The horse will be ready for me at the Ponte Rosso barrier at one in the night."</p> 
<p>"Is not that rather late? You ought to get into San Lorenzo before the people are up in the morning."</p> 
<p>"So I shall; it's a very fast horse; and I don't want to leave here when there's a chance of anyone noticing me. I shan't go home any more; there's a spy watching at the door, and he thinks me in."</p> 
<p>"How did you get out without his seeing you?"</p> 
<p>"Out of the kitchen window into the back garden and over the neighbour's orchard wall; that's what makes me so late; I had to dodge him. I left the owner of the horse to sit in the study all the evening with the lamp lighted. When the spy sees the light in the window and a shadow on the blind he will be quite satisfied that I am writing at home this evening."</p> 
<p>"Then you will stay here till it is time to go to the barrier?"</p> 
<p>"Yes; I don't want to be seen in the street any more to-night. Have a cigar, Martini? I know Signora Bolla doesn't mind smoke."</p> 
<p>"I shan't be here to mind; I must go downstairs and help Katie with the dinner."</p> 
<p>When she had gone Martini got up and began to pace to and fro with his hands behind his back. The Gadfly sat smoking and looking silently out at the drizzling rain.</p> 
<p>"Rivarez!" Martini began, stopping in front of him, but keeping his eyes on the ground; "what sort of thing are you going to drag her into?"</p> 
<p>The Gadfly took the cigar from his mouth and blew away a long trail of smoke.</p> 
<p>"She has chosen for herself," he said, "without compulsion on anyone's part."</p> 
<p>"Yes, yes--I know. But tell me----"</p> 
<p>He stopped.</p> 
<p>"I will tell you anything I can."</p> 
<p>"Well, then--I don't know much about the details of these affairs in the hills,--are you going to take her into any very serious danger?"</p> 
<p>"Do you want the truth?"</p> 
<p>"Yes."</p> 
<p>"Then--yes."</p> 
<p>Martini turned away and went on pacing up and down. Presently he stopped again.</p> 
<p>"I want to ask you another question. If you don't choose to answer it, you needn't, of course; but if you do answer, then answer honestly. Are you in love with her?"</p> 
<p>The Gadfly deliberately knocked the ash from his cigar and went on smoking in silence.</p> 
<p>"That means--that you don't choose to answer?"</p> 
<p>"No; only that I think I have a right to know why you ask me that."</p> 
<p>"Why? Good God, man, can't you see why?"</p> 
<p>"Ah!" He laid down his cigar and looked steadily at Martini. "Yes," he said at last, slowly and softly. "I am in love with her. But you needn't think I am going to make love to her, or worry about it. I am only going to----"</p> 
<p>His voice died away in a strange, faint whisper. Martini came a step nearer.</p> 
<p>"Only going--to----"</p> 
<p>"To die."</p> 
<p>He was staring straight before him with a cold, fixed look, as if he were dead already. When he spoke again his voice was curiously lifeless and even.</p> 
<p>"You needn't worry her about it beforehand," he said; "but there's not the ghost of a chance for me. It's dangerous for everyone; that she knows as well as I do; but the smugglers will do their best to prevent her getting taken. They are good fellows, though they are a bit rough. As for me, the rope is round my neck, and when I cross the frontier I pull the noose."</p> 
<p>"Rivarez, what do you mean? Of course it's dangerous, and particularly so for you; I understand that; but you have often crossed the frontier before and always been successful."</p> 
<p>"Yes, and this time I shall fail."</p> 
<p>"But why? How can you know?"</p> 
<p>The Gadfly smiled drearily.</p> 
<p>"Do you remember the German legend of the man that died when he met his own Double? No? It appeared to him at night in a lonely place, wringing its hands in despair. Well, I met mine the last time I was in the hills; and when I cross the frontier again I shan't come back."</p> 
<p>Martini came up to him and put a hand on the back of his chair.</p> 
<p>"Listen, Rivarez; I don't understand a word of all this metaphysical stuff, but I do understand one thing: If you feel about it that way, you are not in a fit state to go. The surest way to get taken is to go with a conviction that you will be taken. You must be ill, or out of sorts somehow, to get maggots of that kind into your head. Suppose I go instead of you? I can do any practical work there is to be done, and you can send a message to your men, explaining------"</p> 
<p>"And let you get killed instead? That would be very clever."</p> 
<p>"Oh, I'm not likely to get killed! They don't know me as they do you. And, besides, even if I did------"</p> 
<p>He stopped, and the Gadfly looked up with a slow, inquiring gaze. Martini's hand dropped by his side.</p> 
<p>"She very likely wouldn't miss me as much as she would you," he said in his most matter-of-fact voice. "And then, besides, Rivarez, this is public business, and we have to look at it from the point of view of utility--the greatest good of the greatest number. Your 'final value'---isn't that what the economists call it?--is higher than mine; I have brains enough to see that, though I haven't any cause to be particularly fond of you. You are a bigger man than I am; I'm not sure that you are a better one, but there's more of you, and your death would be a greater loss than mine."</p> 
<p>From the way he spoke he might have been discussing the value of shares on the Exchange. The Gadfly looked up, shivering as if with cold.</p> 
<p>"Would you have me wait till my grave opens of itself to swallow me up?</p> 
<p>"If I must die, I will encounter darkness as a bride----</p> 
<p>Look here, Martini, you and I are talking nonsense."</p> 
<p>"You are, certainly," said Martini gruffly.</p> 
<p>"Yes, and so are you. For Heaven's sake, don't let's go in for romantic self-sacrifice, like Don Carlos and Marquis Posa. This is the nineteenth century; and if it's my business to die, I have got to do it."</p> 
<p>"And if it's my business to live, I have got to do that, I suppose. You're the lucky one, Rivarez."</p> 
<p>"Yes," the Gadfly assented laconically; "I was always lucky."</p> 
<p>They smoked in silence for a few minutes, and then began to talk of business details. When Gemma came up to call them to dinner, neither of them betrayed in face or manner that their conversation had been in any way unusual. After dinner they sat discussing plans and making necessary arrangements till eleven o'clock, when Martini rose and took his hat.</p> 
<p>"I will go home and fetch that riding-cloak of mine, Rivarez. I think you will be less recognizable in it than in your light suit. I want to reconnoitre a bit, too, and make sure there are no spies about before we start."</p> 
<p>"Are you coming with me to the barrier?"</p> 
<p>"Yes; it's safer to have four eyes than two in case of anyone following you. I'll be back by twelve. Be sure you don't start without me. I had better take the key, Gemma, so as not to wake anyone by ringing."</p> 
<p>She raised her eyes to his face as he took the keys. She understood that he had invented a pretext in order to leave her alone with the Gadfly.</p> 
<p>"You and I will talk to-morrow," she said. "We shall have time in the morning, when my packing is finished."</p> 
<p>"Oh, yes! Plenty of time. There are two or three little things I want to ask you about, Rivarez; but we can talk them over on our way to the barrier. You had better send Katie to bed, Gemma; and be as quiet as you can, both of you. Good-bye till twelve, then."</p> 
<p>He went away with a little nod and smile, banging the door after him to let the neighbours hear that Signora Bolla's visitor was gone.</p> 
<p>Gemma went out into the kitchen to say good-night to Katie, and came back with black coffee on a tray.</p> 
<p>"Would you like to lie down a bit?" she said. "You won't have any sleep the rest of the night."</p> 
<p>"Oh, dear no! I shall sleep at San Lorenzo while the men are getting my disguise ready."</p> 
<p>"Then have some coffee. Wait a minute; I will get you out the biscuits."</p> 
<p>As she knelt down at the side-board he suddenly stooped over her shoulder.</p> 
<p>"Whatever have you got there? Chocolate creams and English toffee! Why, this is l-luxury for a king!"</p> 
<p>She looked up, smiling faintly at his enthusiastic tone.</p> 
<p>"Are you fond of sweets? I always keep them for Cesare; he is a perfect baby over any kind of lollipops."</p> 
<p>"R-r-really? Well, you must get him s-some more to-morrow and give me these to take with me. No, let me p-p-put the toffee in my pocket; it will console me for all the lost joys of life. I d-do hope they'll give me a bit of toffee to suck the day I'm hanged."</p> 
<p>"Oh, do let me find a cardboard box for it, at least, before you put it in your pocket! You will be so sticky! Shall I put the chocolates in, too?"</p> 
<p>"No, I want to eat them now, with you."</p> 
<p>"But I don't like chocolate, and I want you to come and sit down like a reasonable human being. We very likely shan't have another chance to talk quietly before one or other of us is killed, and------"</p> 
<p>"She d-d-doesn't like chocolate!" he murmured under his breath. "Then I must be greedy all by myself. This is a case of the hangman's supper, isn't it? You are going to humour all my whims to-night. First of all, I want you to sit on this easy-chair, and, as you said I might lie down, I shall lie here and be comfortable."</p> 
<p>He threw himself down on the rug at her feet, leaning his elbow on the chair and looking up into her face.</p> 
<p>"How pale you are!" he said. "That's because you take life sadly, and don't like chocolate----"</p> 
<p>"Do be serious for just five minutes! After all, it is a matter of life and death."</p> 
<p>"Not even for two minutes, dear; neither life nor death is worth it."</p> 
<p>He had taken hold of both her hands and was stroking them with the tips of his fingers.</p> 
<p>"Don't look so grave, Minerva! You'll make me cry in a minute, and then you'll be sorry. I do wish you'd smile again; you have such a d-delightfully unexpected smile. There now, don't scold me, dear! Let us eat our biscuits together, like two good children, without quarrelling over them --for to-morrow we die."</p> 
<p>He took a sweet biscuit from the plate and carefully halved it, breaking the sugar ornament down the middle with scrupulous exactness.</p> 
<p>"This is a kind of sacrament, like what the goody-goody people have in church. 'Take, eat; this is my body.' And we must d-drink the wine out of the s-s-same glass, you know--yes, that is right. 'Do this in remembrance----'"</p> 
<p>She put down the glass.</p> 
<p>"Don't!" she said, with almost a sob. He looked up, and took her hands again.</p> 
<p>"Hush, then! Let us be quiet for a little bit. When one of us dies, the other will remember this. We will forget this loud, insistent world that howls about our ears; we will go away together, hand in hand; we will go away into the secret halls of death, and lie among the poppy-flowers. Hush! We will be quite still."</p> 
<p>He laid his head down against her knee and covered his face. In the silence she bent over him, her hand on the black head. So the time slipped on and on; and they neither moved nor spoke.</p> 
<p>"Dear, it is almost twelve," she said at last. He raised his head.</p> 
<p>"We have only a few minutes more; Martini will be back presently. Perhaps we shall never see each other again. Have you nothing to say to me?"</p> 
<p>He slowly rose and walked away to the other side of the room. There was a moment's silence.</p> 
<p>"I have one thing to say," he began in a hardly audible voice; "one thing--to tell you----"</p> 
<p>He stopped and sat down by the window, hiding his face in both hands.</p> 
<p>"You have been a long time deciding to be merciful," she said softly.</p> 
<p>"I have not seen much mercy in my life; and I thought--at first--you wouldn't care----"</p> 
<p>"You don't think that now."</p> 
<p>She waited a moment for him to speak and then crossed the room and stood beside him.</p> 
<p>"Tell me the truth at last," she whispered. "Think, if you are killed and I not--I should have to go through all my life and never know--never be quite sure----"</p> 
<p>He took her hands and clasped them tightly.</p> 
<p>"If I am killed---- You see, when I went to South America---- Ah, Martini!"</p> 
<p>He broke away with a violent start and threw open the door of the room. Martini was rubbing his boots on the mat.</p> 
<p>"Punctual to the m-m-minute, as usual! You're an an-n-nimated chronometer, Martini. Is that the r-r-riding-cloak?"</p> 
<p>"Yes; and two or three other things. I have kept them as dry as I could, but it's pouring with rain. You will have a most uncomfortable ride, I'm afraid."</p> 
<p>"Oh, that's no matter. Is the street clear?"</p> 
<p>"Yes; all the spies seem to have gone to bed. I don't much wonder either, on such a villainous night. Is that coffee, Gemma? He ought to have something hot before he goes out into the wet, or he will catch cold."</p> 
<p>"It is black coffee, and very strong. I will boil some milk."</p> 
<p>She went into the kitchen, passionately clenching her teeth and hands to keep from breaking down. When she returned with the milk the Gadfly had put on the riding-cloak and was fastening the leather gaiters which Martini had brought. He drank a cup of coffee, standing, and took up the broad-brimmed riding hat.</p> 
<p>"I think it's time to start, Martini; we must make a round before we go to the barrier, in case of anything. Good-bye, for the present, signora; I shall meet you at Forli on Friday, then, unless anything special turns up. Wait a minute; th-this is the address."</p> 
<p>He tore a leaf out of his pocket-book and wrote a few words in pencil.</p> 
<p>"I have it already," she said in a dull, quiet voice.</p> 
<p>"H-have you? Well, there it is, anyway. Come, Martini. Sh-sh-sh! Don't let the door creak!"</p> 
<p>They crept softly downstairs. When the street door clicked behind them she went back into the room and mechanically unfolded the paper he had put into her hand. Underneath the address was written:</p> 
<p>"I will tell you everything there."</p> 
<p>随后的五个星期里，琼玛和牛虻兴奋不已，忙得不可开交。他们既没有时间，也没有精力去思考他们个人的事情。当武器平安地运进教皇领地以后，剩下的是一项更加艰难、更危险的任务，那就是把它们从山洞和山谷的秘密隐藏地点悄悄运到当地的各个中心，然后再运到各个村庄。整个地区到处都是暗探，牛虻把弹药交给了多米尼季诺。多米尼季诺派了一个信使到了佛罗伦萨，紧急呼吁派人帮忙，要不就宽限时间。牛虻曾经坚持这一工作必须在六月底之前完成。可是道路崎岖，运送辎重是件难事；而且为了随时躲避侦探，运期一再耽搁。多米尼季诺已经陷入绝望。“我是进退两难，”他在信上写道，“我不敢加快工作，因为怕被发觉。如果我们想要按时作好准备，我就不该拖延。要不立即派个得力的人来帮忙，要不就让威尼斯人知道我们在七月的第一个星期之前无法做好准备。”</p> 
<p>牛虻把信带到琼玛那里。她一边看着信，一边皱着眉头坐在地板上，并且用手逆抚小猫的毛。</p> 
<p>“这可糟糕了，”她说，“我们可不能让威尼斯人等上三个星期。”</p> 
<p>“我们当然不能，这事真是荒唐。多米尼季诺也、也许明、明、明白这一点。我们必须按照威尼斯人的步骤行事，而不是让他们按照我们的步骤行事。”</p> 
<p>“我看这不怪多米尼季诺，他显然已经尽了全力。无法完成的事情，他是做不成的。”</p> 
<p>“问题并不出在多米尼季诺身上，问题出在他身兼两职。我们至少应该安排一个人负责看守货物，另外安排一个人负责运输。他说得很对。他必须得到切实的帮助。”</p> 
<p>“但是我们能给他什么帮助呢？我们在佛罗伦萨没人可以派去啊。”</p> 
<p>“那么我就必须亲自去了。”</p> 
<p>她靠在椅子上，略微皱起眉头看着他。</p> 
<p>“不，那不行。这太危险了。”</p> 
<p>“如果我们找、找、找不到别的办法解决问题，那么只能这样。”</p> 
<p>“那么我们必须找到别的办法，就这样定了。你现在又去，这不可能。”</p> 
<p>他的嘴唇下角出现了一条固执的线条。</p> 
<p>“我看不出这有什么不可能。”</p> 
<p>“你还是平心静气地想上一分钟。你回来以后只有五个星期，警察还在追查朝圣的事情，他们四处出动，想要找出一条线索。是，我知道你精于伪装，但是记住很多人看见过你，既见过扮作迭亚戈的你，也见过扮作农民的你。你既无法伪装你的瘸腿，也无法伪装你脸上的伤痕。”</p> 
<p>“这个世上瘸腿的人多、多着呢。”</p> 
<p>“对，但是你瘸了一只腿，脸上有块刀疤，左臂受了伤，而且你的眼睛是蓝色的，皮肤又这么黝黑。在罗马尼阿，像你这样的人可不多。”</p> 
<p>“眼睛没关系。我可以用颠茄改变它们的颜色。”</p> 
<p>“你不能改变其他东西。不，这不行。因为你现在这样堂而皇之地去，你会睁眼走进陷阱里去。你肯定会被抓住。”</p> 
<p>“但是必须有、有、有人帮助多米尼季诺。”</p> 
<p>“让你在这样的紧急时刻被捕，对他来说毫无帮助。你的被捕只会意味着整个事情宣告失败。”</p> 
<p>但是很难说服牛虻，他们讨论了半天也没有结果。琼玛开始意识到他的性格极其固执，虽然言语不多，可就是宁折不弯。如果她不是对这件事感触很深，她很可能会息事宁人，作出让步。可是在这件事情上，她的良心不许她作出让步。从拟议的行程中所得的实际好处，在她看来都不足以值得去冒险。她禁不住怀疑他急于想去，与其说是出于坚信政治上的迫切需要，倒不如说是出于一种病态的渴望，想要体会危险的刺激。他已经习惯于拿生命去冒险，他易于闯进不必要的险境之中。她认为这是放荡不羁的表现，应该平静而又坚定地予以抵抗。发现争来争去都无法打消他那自行其是的顽强决心，她使出了最后的一着。</p> 
<p>“我们还是坦率地对待这事，”她说，“实事求是。并不是多米尼季诺的困难使你如此决意要去，只是你自己热衷于——”</p> 
<p>“这不是真的！”他激烈地打断了她的话。“他对我来说不算什么，即使我再也见不到他，我也不在乎。”</p> 
<p>他停了下来，从她的脸上看出他的心事业已暴露。他们的眼睛突然相对而视，然后又垂了下来。他们都没有讲出心中俱知的那个名字。</p> 
<p>“我并、并不想挽救多米尼季诺。”他最后结结巴巴地说道，脸却半埋在猫的毛发里。“而是我、我明白如果他得不到帮助，我们的工作就有失败的危险。”</p> 
<p>她没有理会他那不值一驳的遁词，接着说了下去，好像她并没被打断过。</p> 
<p>“你是因为热衷于冒险，所以你才想去那儿。在你烦恼的时候，你渴望冒险；在你生病的时间，你想要得到鸦片。”</p> 
<p>“我并没索要鸦片，”他执意说道，“是别人坚持让我服的。”</p> 
<p>“大概是吧。你有点为你的禁欲主义而引以为豪，要求肉体的解脱就会伤害你的自尊。但是在你冒着生命危险去缓解神经的刺激时，你的自尊则会在很大程度上得到满意。不管怎么说，这种差别仅是一个惯常的差别。”</p> 
<p>他把猫的脑袋扳到后面，俯身望着那双绿色的圆眼睛。</p> 
<p>“帕希特，真的吗？——”他说。“你的主人说、说我的这些苛刻的话是真的吗？这是‘我有罪，我犯下大罪’的事情吗？你这只聪明的动物，你从来就不索要鸦片，是吗？你的祖先是埃及的神灵，没人会踩它们的尾巴。可是我想知道的是，如果我截下你的猫爪，把它凑到烛火之中，你对人间罪恶的超然态度又会怎样。那你就会找我索要鸦片吧？抑或也许——寻死吧？不，猫咪，我们没有权利为了个人而去寻死。我们也—也许骂骂咧咧，如果这能安慰我们的话。但是我们不必扯下猫爪。”</p> 
<p>“嘘！”她把猫从他的膝上拿下来，然后把它放在一只小凳上。“你我可以回头考虑这些东西。我们现在必须考虑怎样才能帮助多米尼季诺脱离困境。凯蒂，怎么回事？来了一位客人。我忙着呢。”</p> 
<p>“赖特小姐派了专人送来了这个，夫人。”</p> 
<p>包裹封得严严实实，里面装着一封写给赖特小姐的信。信没有拆开，上面贴着教皇领地的邮票。琼玛以前的同学仍然住在佛罗伦萨，为了安全起见，比较重要的信件经常是寄到她们那里。</p> 
<p>“这是米歇尔的记号。”她说。她迅速瞥了一眼，信上似乎谈的是亚平宁山区一所寄宿学校的夏季费用。她指着信件一角的两处小点。“这是用化学墨水写的，试剂就在写字台的第三个抽屉里。对，就是那个。”</p> 
<p>他把信摊在写字台上，拿着一把小刷子在信上涂了一遍。</p> 
<p>当信上的真正内容显现出来时，他看到了那行鲜艳的蓝字，然后靠在椅背上放声大笑。</p> 
<p>“怎么回事？”她匆忙问道。他把信递给了她。</p> 
<p>多米尼季诺已经被捕。速来。</p> 
<p>她拿着信坐了下来，绝望地凝视着牛虻。</p> 
<p>“呃——呃？”他最后说道，拖着柔和、嘲讽的声音。“你现在总该相信我必须去吧？”</p> 
<p>“是，我想你必须去，”她叹息一声回答，“我也去。”</p> 
<p>他抬起头来，有些吃惊。“你也去？但是——”</p> 
<p>“那当然了。我知道佛罗伦萨一个人也不留，会很不方便的。但是为了提供额外的人手，现在一切都要搁在一边。”</p> 
<p>“那儿有足够的人手。”</p> 
<p>“但是他们并不属于你能信任的人。你刚才自己说过必须有两个人分头负责，如果多米尼季诺无法做成这件事情，那么显然你也无法做成。记住，在做这种工作时，像你这样时刻都有危险的人会很不方便的，而且会比别人更需要帮助。如果不是你和多米尼季诺，那一定就是你和我。”</p> 
<p>他皱着眉头考虑了一会儿。</p> 
<p>“对，你说得很对，”他说，“而且是越快越好。但是我们不该一起出发。如果我今晚出发，嗯，你明天可以乘坐下午的马车。”</p> 
<p>“去哪儿？”</p> 
<p>“这一点我们必须讨论一下。我认为我最、最、最好还是直接去范查。如果我今天深夜出发，乘车到达圣·罗伦索，那我可以在那儿安排我的装扮，然后我接着往前赶。”</p> 
<p>“我看不出我们还有别的办法。”她说，着急地略微皱起了眉头。“但是这样非常危险，你这样匆忙动身，委托博尔戈的私贩子给你找个伪装。在你越过边境之前，你至少应该安排三个整天来扰乱踪迹。”</p> 
<p>“你不用害怕，”他笑着回答，“再往前我也许被抓起来，但是在越过边境时不会被捕。一旦到了山里，我就像在这里一样安全。亚平宁山区没有一个私贩子会出卖我。我倒是不大清楚你怎样才能通过边境。”</p> 
<p>“噢，那很简单！我就拿上路易丝·赖特的护照，装作去度假。罗马尼阿没人认识我，但是每一个暗探都认识你。”</p> 
<p>“幸运的是，每一个私贩子也都认识我。”</p> 
<p>她拿出表来。</p> 
<p>“两点半。如果我们今晚动身，我们还有一个下午和一个傍晚。”</p> 
<p>“那么我最好还是回家，现在就把一切安排好，然后弄上一匹快马。我就骑马去圣·罗伦索，那样安全。”</p> 
<p>“但是租用马匹一点儿也不安全。马的主人会——”</p> 
<p>“我不会去租马的。我认识一个人，他会借我一匹马。他这个人可以信赖。他以前为我做过事。边境上的一个牧羊人会把马送回来。那么，我会在五点或五点半到这儿来。我走了以后，我想、想让你去找马尔蒂尼，把一切都向他解释一下。”</p> 
<p>“马尔蒂尼！”她转过身来，吃惊地看着他。</p> 
<p>“对，我们必须相信他，除非你能想到另外一个人。”</p> 
<p>“我不大明白你的意思。”</p> 
<p>“我们在这儿必须有个能够信任的人，防止遇到任何特别的困难。在所有的人当中，我最相信马尔蒂尼。里卡尔多当然什么事都愿为我们做，但是我认为马尔蒂尼的头脑更加冷静。不过，你还是比我更了解他。你看着办吧。”</p> 
<p>“我丝毫也不怀疑马尔蒂尼的可靠和各方面的能力，而且我也认为他可能同意尽量帮助我们。但是——”</p> 
<p>他立即就明白了。</p> 
<p>“琼玛，如果你发现了一位同志急于得到帮助，因为害怕伤害你的感情，或者害怕让你感到烦恼，他竟然没有请你给予可能的帮助，你有什么感想呢？你会说这样做是出于真正的好心吗？”</p> 
<p>“很好，”她沉默片刻以后说道，“我马上就派凯蒂去把他请来。在她出去以后，我去把路易斯的护照拿来。她答应过我，不管什么时候，只要我需要，她都会把它借给我。钱怎么办？要我上银行取出一些钱吗？”</p> 
<p>“不，别为钱浪费时间。我可以从我的存款里把钱取出来，这笔钱我们足以用上一段时间。如果我的存款用完了，我们回头再来动用你的存款。那么我们五点半再见。我当然能在这儿见到你，对吗？”</p> 
<p>“噢，对！那时我早就应该回来了。”</p> 
<p>约定的时间过后半个小时，他回到了这里，发现琼玛和马尔蒂尼一起坐在阳台上。他立即就看出他们的谈话不很愉快，两人显然进行过激烈的讨论。马尔蒂尼异乎寻常地沉默，闷闷不乐。</p> 
<p>“你把一切都安排好了吗？”她抬头问道。</p> 
<p>“对，我还给你带来了一些钱，让你路上用。马也准备好了，半夜一点在罗索桥关卡等我。”</p> 
<p>“那样不是太晚了吗？你应该在清晨到达圣·罗伦索，那时人们还没起床。”</p> 
<p>“我那时应该已经到了。那是一匹快马，我走的时候不想让人看见我。我不回家了，有个暗探守在门口，他还以为我在家里。”</p> 
<p>“你出来怎么没有让他看见你？”</p> 
<p>“我是从后花园的厨房窗户钻出来的，然后翻过邻家果园的院墙。所以来得这么晚，我得躲着他。我让马匹的主人待在书房里，整夜都点着灯。当那个暗探看见窗户里的灯光和窗帘上的影子时，他会确信我今晚是在家里写作。”</p> 
<p>“那么你就待在这儿，到了时间从这儿去关卡吗？”</p> 
<p>“对，我不想今晚让人在街上看见。马尔蒂尼，抽烟吗？我知道波拉夫人不介意别人抽烟的。”</p> 
<p>“我不会介意你们在这儿抽烟。我必须下去，帮助凯蒂准备晚餐。”</p> 
<p>当她走了以后，马尔蒂尼站了起来，双手背在身后，开始踱起步来。牛虻坐在那里抽着烟，默默地望着毛毛细雨。</p> 
<p>“里瓦雷兹！”马尔蒂尼开口说道，他就站在他的面前，但是眼睛却看着地面。“你想把她拖进什么样的事情之中？”</p> 
<p>牛虻把雪茄从嘴里取了出来，吹出了长长的烟圈。</p> 
<p>“她独自作的决定，”他说，“没人强迫过她。”</p> 
<p>“是，是——我知道。但是告诉我——”</p> 
<p>他停了下来。</p> 
<p>“我会尽力相告。”</p> 
<p>“呃，那么——我并不知道山里那些事情的细节——你要带她去做一件非常危险的事吗？”</p> 
<p>“你想知道真相吗？”</p> 
<p>“是。”</p> 
<p>“那么——是吧。”</p> 
<p>马尔蒂尼转过了身，继续踱来踱去。他很快又停了下来。</p> 
<p>“我还想问你一个问题。如果你选择不作回答，你当然就不必回答。但是如果你回答的话，那么你就坦率地回答。你爱她吗？”</p> 
<p>牛虻故意敲掉雪茄上的烟灰，然后接着抽烟。</p> 
<p>“这就是说——你选择不作回答？”</p> 
<p>“不，只是我认为我有权知道你为什么要问我这个。”</p> 
<p>“为什么？天啊，伙计，难道你看不出为什么吗？”</p> 
<p>“噢！”他放下雪茄，平静地望着马尔蒂尼。“对，”他最后和缓地说，“我爱她。但是你不要想着我会向她求爱，不要为此担心。我只是去——”</p> 
<p>他的声音变成奇怪、无力的低语，然后逐渐消失。马尔蒂尼上前一步。</p> 
<p>“只是——去——”</p> 
<p>“死。”</p> 
<p>他直愣愣地凝视前方，目光冷漠而又呆滞，仿佛他已死了一样。当他再次开口说话时，奇怪的是他的声音毫无生气，平平淡淡。</p> 
<p>“你不用事先为她感到担心，”他说，“对我来说，我是一点希望也没有了。这事对大家都是危险的，这一点她和我都知道。但是私贩子会尽量不让她被抓住。他们都是好人，尽管他们有点粗俗。对我来说，绳索已经套在我的脖子上。在我通过边境时，我就扯紧了绞索。”</p> 
<p>“里瓦雷兹，你这话是什么意思？当然有危险，对你尤其危险。这一点我也明白，但是你以前也曾通过边境，而且一向都是成功的。”</p> 
<p>“对，这一次我会失败的。”</p> 
<p>“但是为什么？你怎么知道？”</p> 
<p>牛虻露出倦怠的微笑。</p> 
<p>“你还记得那个德国传说吗？人要是遇到了长得跟他一模一样的幽灵，他就会死的。不记得？那个幽灵在一个孤寂的地方向他现身，绝望地挥动它的胳膊。呃，上次我在山里时，我见到了我的幽灵。在我再次通过边境时，我就回不来了。”</p> 
<p>马尔蒂尼走到他跟前，并把一只手放在他的椅背上。</p> 
<p>“听着，里瓦雷兹。这一套故弄玄虚的东西，我一个字也听不懂。但是我明白一点：如果你有了这种预感，你就不宜出发。既然坚信你会被捕还要去，那么被捕的可能性就最大。你一定是病了，或者身体有点不大舒服，所以这样胡思乱想。假如我替你去呢？那里该做的任何实际工作，我都可以去做。你可以给你的那些人写封信去，解释——”</p> 
<p>“让你去送死吗？这倒是挺聪明的。”</p> 
<p>“噢，我不可能死的！他们都认识你，但是却不认识我。此外，即使我被捕了——”</p> 
<p>他停了下来，牛虻抬起头来，用探询的目光慢慢地打量着他。马尔蒂尼的手垂在他的身边。</p> 
<p>“她很可能不像思念你一样深深地思念我。”他说，声音平淡无奇。“此外，里瓦雷兹，这是公事。我们得从功利的观点看待这个事情——对于大多数人们的最大好处。你的‘最终价值’——这是不是经济学家的叫法？——比我的要大。我虽然不够聪明，但是还能看到这一点，尽管我并没有理由非要特别喜欢你不可。你比我伟大，我并不敢说你比我更好，但是你确有更多的长处，你的死比我的死损失更大。”</p> 
<p>从他说话的神情来看，他似乎是在讨论股票在交易所的价值。牛虻抬起头来，好像冻得浑身发抖。</p> 
<p>“你愿让我等到我的坟墓自行张开把我吞下吗？</p> 
<p>假如我必须死，</p> 
<p>我会把黑暗当作新娘——［引自莎士比亚的喜剧《一报还一报》第三幕第一场。“假如我必须死，我会把黑暗当作新娘。”（朱生豪译文）］</p> 
<p>“你瞧，马尔蒂尼，你我说的都是废话。”</p> 
<p>“你说的当然都是废话。”马尔蒂尼气呼呼地说。</p> 
<p>“对，可你说的也是废话。看在老天的份上，我们不要去做罗曼蒂克的自我牺牲，就像堂·卡洛斯和波莎侯爵一样［席勒悲剧《堂·卡洛斯》（DonCarlos）中的两个主要人物。堂·卡洛斯是西班牙国王菲利浦二世的儿子，因有反政府倾向，被其父拘禁，后来死在狱中。波莎侯爵是堂·卡洛斯的好友，为了营救他而牺牲了自己。］。这可是十九世纪啊，如果我的任务就是去死，那么还是让我去死吧。”</p> 
<p>“如果我的任务就是活着，我想我就得活着。你是一位幸运儿，里瓦雷兹。”</p> 
<p>“对。”牛虻直截了当地承认，“我以前一直都很幸运。”</p> 
<p>他们默默地吸烟，过了几分钟开始谈起具体的细节。当琼玛上来招呼他们吃饭时，他们俩的脸色或者举止都没有露出他们进行了一次不同寻常的谈话。吃完饭后，他们坐下来讨论计划，并且作些必要的安排。到了十一点时，马尔蒂尼起身拿过他的帽子。</p> 
<p>“里瓦雷兹，我回家去取我的骑马斗篷。我看你穿上它就不容易被人认出来，不像你这一身轻装。我还去侦察一下，确定在我们动身时附近没有暗探。”</p> 
<p>“你把我送到关卡那儿吗？”</p> 
<p>“对，要是有人跟着你，四只眼睛要比两只眼睛保险。我十二点回来。千万等我回来再走。我最好还是带上钥匙，琼玛，这样就不会因为摁铃吵醒别人。”</p> 
<p>在他常起钥匙时，她抬起头来望着他的脸。她明白他找了一个借口，以便让她单独和牛虻待上一段时间。</p> 
<p>“你我明天再谈，”她说，“早晨等我收拾好了以后，我们还有时间。”</p> 
<p>“噢，对！很多时间。还有两三件小事我想问你，里瓦雷兹，但是我们可以在去关卡时再谈。你最好还是让凯蒂睡觉去，琼玛。你们俩尽量轻点。那么我们就十二点时再见。”</p> 
<p>他略微点了一下头，带着微笑走开。他砰的一声随手把门关上，以便让邻居听到波拉夫人的客人已经离去。</p> 
<p>琼玛走进厨房去和凯蒂互道晚安，然后用托盘端着咖啡走了回来。</p> 
<p>“你想躺一会儿吗？”她说，“后半夜你可没有时间睡觉。”</p> 
<p>“噢，亲爱的，不！到了圣·罗伦索，在那些人为我准备装束时，我可以去睡觉。”</p> 
<p>当她在食品橱前跪下身来时，他突然在她肩膀上方弯下腰来。</p> 
<p>“你这儿有些什么？巧克力奶糖和英国太妃糖！怎么，这可是国王才配享用的奢侈品！”</p> 
<p>她抬起头来，对其喜悦的语调报以淡淡的一笑。</p> 
<p>“你喜欢吃甜食吗？我总是为塞萨雷存上一些。他简直就像小孩子一样，什么糖都爱吃。”</p> 
<p>“真、真、真的吗？呃，你明天一定要为他再弄、弄一些，这些让我带走吧。不，让我把太妃糖装、装、装进我的口袋里，它会安慰我，让我想起失去的快乐生活。我的、的确希望在我被绞死的那天，他们会给我一点太妃糖吃。”</p> 
<p>“噢，还是让我来找一个纸盒子装着吧，至少在你把糖放在口袋之前！你会弄得粘乎乎的！要我把巧克力也放进去吗？”</p> 
<p>“不，我想现在就吃，和你一起吃。”</p> 
<p>“但是我不喜欢巧克力呀，我想让你过来，正儿八经地坐着。在你或我被杀之前，我们很可能再也没有机会静静地交谈，而且——”</p> 
<p>“她不喜欢巧克力！”他喃喃地说道。“那我就得独自放开吃了！这就是断头饭，对吗？今晚你就满足我的一切怪念头吧。首先，我想让你坐在这把安乐椅上，因为你说过我可以躺下来，我就躺在这里舒服一下。”</p> 
<p>他躺在她脚边的地毯上，胳膊肘靠着椅子。他抬头望着她。</p> 
<p>“你的脸色真白！”他说，“这是因为你对生活持着悲观的态度，而且不喜欢吃巧克力——”</p> 
<p>“你就严肃五分钟吧！这可是个生与死的问题。”</p> 
<p>“严肃两分钟也不行，亲爱的。不管是生是死都不值得严肃。”</p> 
<p>他已经抓住了她的双手，正用指尖抚摸它们。</p> 
<p>“别这样神情庄重，密涅瓦［罗马神话中的智慧女伸、女战神，又叫雅典娜。］。再这样一分钟，你就会让我哭出声，然后你就会后悔的。我真的希望你再次露出微笑，你的笑容总是给人一种意外的喜、喜悦。好了，你别骂我，亲爱的！我们还是一起吃着饼干，就像两个乖孩子一样，不要为了吃多吃少而吵架——因为明天我们就会死去。”</p> 
<p>他从盘子中拿过一块甜饼，谨慎地比画成两半，一丝不苟地从中折断。</p> 
<p>“这是一种圣餐，就像那些道貌岸然之徒在教堂里吃的一样。‘你们拿着吃，这是我的身体。’而且你知道，我们必须用同一个杯子喝酒——对，这就对了。为了缅怀——”</p> 
<p>她放下酒杯。</p> 
<p>“别这样！”她说，几乎哭出声来。他抬起头来，再次握住她的双手。</p> 
<p>“那就别说话！我们就安静一会儿。当我们中间一个人死了，另一个人将会记得这一切。我们将会忘记这个喧闹而又永恒的世界，我们将会一起离开这个世界，手拉着手。我们将会走进死亡的秘密殿堂，躺在那些罂粟花的中间。嘘！我们将会十分安静。”</p> 
<p>他垂下头来靠在她的膝上，掩住了他的脸。她默不做声地朝他俯下身去，她的手放在那头黑发上。时间就这样流逝过去了，他们既没有动也没有说话。</p> 
<p>“亲爱的，快到十二点了。”她最终说道。他抬起了头。</p> 
<p>“我们只有几分钟的时间了，马尔蒂尼很快就会回来。或许我们再也不会相见了。你没有什么要跟我说吗？”</p> 
<p>他缓慢地站起身来，走到屋子的另一头。</p> 
<p>“我有一件要说，”他开口说道，声音低得几乎听不清楚，“一件事——是要告诉你——”</p> 
<p>他停了下来，坐在窗户旁边，双手捂住了脸。</p> 
<p>“过了这么长的时间，你总算决定发点慈悲了。”她轻声说道。</p> 
<p>“我这一生没有见过多少慈悲，我以为——开始的时候——你不会在乎——”</p> 
<p>“你现在不这么想吧。”</p> 
<p>她等了一会儿，然后走到屋子的另一头，站在他的身边。</p> 
<p>“你就把实情告诉我吧。”她小声说道，“想一想，如果你被杀了，我却活着——我就得回顾我的一生，但却永远也不知道——永远都不能肯定——”</p> 
<p>他抓起她的手，紧紧地握住它们。</p> 
<p>“如果我被杀死了——你知道，当我去了南美——噢，马尔蒂尼！”</p> 
<p>他猛然吓了一跳，赶紧打住话头，并且打开房门。马尔蒂尼正在门口的垫子上蹭着靴子。</p> 
<p>“一分—分钟也不差，就像平时那样准时！你俨然就是一座天文钟。那就是骑—骑—骑马斗篷吗？”</p> 
<p>“是，还有两三样别的东西。我尽量没让它们淋雨，可是外面正在下着倾盆大雨。恐怕你在路上会很不舒服的。”</p> 
<p>“噢，那没关系。街上没有暗探吧？”</p> 
<p>“没有，所有的暗探好像都已回去睡觉了。今晚天气这么糟糕，我想这也不奇怪。琼玛，那是咖啡吗？他在出门之前应该吃点热的东西，否则他会感冒的。”</p> 
<p>“咖啡什么也没加，挺浓的。我去煮些牛奶。”</p> 
<p>她走进厨房，拼命咬紧牙齿，并且握紧双手，不让自己哭出声来。当她端着牛奶回来时，牛虻已经穿上了斗篷，正在系上马尔蒂尼带来的长统皮靴。他站着喝下了一杯咖啡，然后拿起了宽边骑马帽。</p> 
<p>“我看该出发了，马尔蒂尼。我们必须先兜上一个圈子，然后再去关卡，防止发生万一。再见，夫人，谢谢你的礼物。那么星期五我在弗利接你，除非出现什么意外。等一等，这—这是地址。”</p> 
<p>他从小本子上撕下一页，拿起铅笔写了几个字。</p> 
<p>“地址我已有了。”她说，声音单调而又平静。</p> 
<p>“有、有了吗？呃，这也拿着吧。走吧，马尔蒂尼。嘘——嘘——嘘！别让门发出吱吱嘎嘎的响声！”</p> 
<p>他们轻手轻脚地下了楼梯。当临街的门咔嗒一声关上时，她走进屋里，机械地打开他塞进她手里的那张纸条。地址的下面写着：</p>
