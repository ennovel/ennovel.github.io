It was a very short and simple affair; a mere formality, occupying barely twenty minutes. There was, indeed, nothing to spend much time over; no defence was allowed, and the only witnesses were the wounded spy and officer and a few soldiers. The sentence was drawn up beforehand; Montanelli had sent in the desired informal consent; and the judges (Colonel Ferrari, the local major of dragoons, and two officers of the Swiss guards) had little to do. The indictment was read aloud, the witnesses gave their evidence, and the signatures were affixed to the sentence, which was then read to the condemned man with befitting solemnity. He listened in silence; and when asked, according to the usual form, whether he had anything to say, merely waved the question aside with an impatient movement of his hand. Hidden on his breast was the handkerchief which Montanelli had let fall. It had been kissed and wept over all night, as though it were a living thing. Now he looked wan and spiritless, and the traces of tears were still about his eyelids; but the words: "to be shot," did not seem to affect him much. When they were uttered, the pupils of his eyes dilated, but that was all.</p> 
<p>"Take him back to his cell," the Governor said. when all the formalities were over; and the sergeant, who was evidently near to breaking down, touched the motionless figure on the shoulder. The Gadfly looked round him with a little start.</p> 
<p>"Ah, yes!" he said. "I forgot."</p> 
<p>There was something almost like pity in the Governor's face. He was not a cruel man by nature, and was secretly a little ashamed of the part he had been playing during the last month. Now that his main point was gained he was willing to make every little concession in his power.</p> 
<p>"You needn't put the irons on again," he said, glancing at the bruised and swollen wrists. "And he can stay in his own cell. The condemned cell is wretchedly dark and gloomy," he added, turning to his nephew; "and really the thing's a mere formality."</p> 
<p>He coughed and shifted his feet in evident embarrassment; then called back the sergeant, who was leaving the room with his prisoner.</p> 
<p>"Wait, sergeant; I want to speak to him."</p> 
<p>The Gadfly did not move, and the Governor's voice seemed to fall on unresponsive ears.</p> 
<p>"If you have any message you would like conveyed to your friends or relatives---- You have relatives, I suppose?"</p> 
<p>There was no answer.</p> 
<p>"Well, think it over and tell me, or the priest. I will see it is not neglected. You had better give your messages to the priest; he shall come at once, and stay the night with you. If there is any other wish----"</p> 
<p>The Gadfly looked up.</p> 
<p>"Tell the priest I would rather be alone. I have no friends and no messages."</p> 
<p>"But you will want to confess."</p> 
<p>"I am an atheist. I want nothing but to be left in peace."</p> 
<p>He said it in a dull, quiet voice, without defiance or irritation; and turned slowly away. At the door he stopped again.</p> 
<p>"I forgot, colonel; there is a favour I wanted to ask. Don't let them tie me or bandage my eyes to-morrow, please. I will stand quite still."</p> 
<p>. . . . .</p> 
<p>At sunrise on Wednesday morning they brought him out into the courtyard. His lameness was more than usually apparent, and he walked with evident difficulty and pain, leaning heavily on the sergeant's arm; but all the weary submission had gone out of his face. The spectral terrors that had crushed him down in the empty silence, the visions and dreams of the world of shadows, were gone with the night which gave them birth; and once the sun was shining and his enemies were present to rouse the fighting spirit in him, he was not afraid.</p> 
<p>The six carabineers who had been told off for the execution were drawn up in line against the ivied wall; the same crannied and crumbling wall down which he had climbed on the night of his unlucky attempt. They could hardly refrain from weeping as they stood together, each man with his carbine in his hand. It seemed to them a horror beyond imagination that they should be called out to kill the Gadfly. He and his stinging repartees, his perpetual laughter, his bright, infectious courage, had come into their dull and dreary lives like a wandering sunbeam; and that he should die, and at their hands, was to them as the darkening of the clear lamps of heaven.</p> 
<p>Under the great fig-tree in the courtyard, his grave was waiting for him. It had been dug in the night by unwilling hands; and tears had fallen on the spade. As he passed he looked down, smiling, at the black pit and the withering grass beside it; and drew a long breath, to smell the scent of the freshly turned earth.</p> 
<p>Near the tree the sergeant stopped short, and the Gadfly looked round with his brightest smile.</p> 
<p>"Shall I stand here, sergeant?"</p> 
<p>The man nodded silently; there was a lump in his throat, and he could not have spoken to save his life. The Governor, his nephew, the lieutenant of carabineers who was to command, a doctor and a priest were already in the courtyard, and came forward with grave faces, half abashed under the radiant defiance of the Gadfly's laughing eyes.</p> 
<p>"G-good morning, gentlemen! Ah, and his reverence is up so early, too! How do you do, captain? This is a pleasanter occasion for you than our former meeting, isn't it? I see your arm is still in a sling; that's because I bungled my work. These good fellows will do theirs better-- won't you, lads?"</p> 
<p>He glanced round at the gloomy faces of the carabineers.</p> 
<p>"There'll be no need of slings this time, any way. There, there, you needn't look so doleful over it! Put your heels together and show how straight you can shoot. Before long there'll be more work cut out for you than you'll know how to get through, and there's nothing like practice beforehand."</p> 
<p>"My son," the priest interrupted, coming forward, while the others drew back to leave them alone together; "in a few minutes you must enter into the presence of your Maker. Have you no other use but this for these last moments that are left you for repentance? Think, I entreat you, how dreadful a thing it is to die without absolution, with all your sins upon your head. When you stand before your Judge it will be too late to repent. Will you approach His awful throne with a jest upon your lips?"</p> 
<p>"A jest, your reverence? It is your side that needs that little homily, I think. When our turn comes we shall use field-guns instead of half a dozen second-hand carbines, and then you'll see how much we're in jest."</p> 
<p>"YOU will use field-guns! Oh, unhappy man! Have you still not realized on what frightful brink you stand?"</p> 
<p>The Gadfly glanced back over his shoulder at the open grave.</p> 
<p>"And s-s-so your reverence thinks that, when you have put me down there, you will have done with me? Perhaps you will lay a stone on the top to pre-v-vent a r-resurrection 'after three days'? No fear, your reverence! I shan't poach on the monopoly in cheap theatricals; I shall lie as still as a m-mouse, just where you put me. And all the same, WE shall use field-guns."</p> 
<p>"Oh, merciful God," the priest cried out; "forgive this wretched man!"</p> 
<p>"Amen!" murmured the lieutenant of carabineers, in a deep bass growl, while the colonel and his nephew crossed themselves devoutly.</p> 
<p>As there was evidently no hope of further insistence producing any effect, the priest gave up the fruitless attempt and moved aside, shaking his head and murmuring a prayer. The short and simple preparations were made without more delay, and the Gadfly placed himself in the required position, only turning his head to glance up for a moment at the red and yellow splendour of the sunrise. He had repeated the request that his eyes might not be bandaged, and his defiant face had wrung from the colonel a reluctant consent. They had both forgotten what they were inflicting on the soldiers.</p> 
<p>He stood and faced them, smiling, and the carbines shook in their hands.</p> 
<p>"I am quite ready," he said.</p> 
<p>The lieutenant stepped forward, trembling a little with excitement. He had never given the word of command for an execution before.</p> 
<p>"Ready--present--fire!"</p> 
<p>The Gadfly staggered a little and recovered his balance. One unsteady shot had grazed his cheek, and a little blood fell on to the white cravat. Another ball had struck him above the knee. When the smoke cleared away the soldiers looked and saw him smiling still and wiping the blood from his cheek with the mutilated hand</p> 
<p>"A bad shot, men!" he said; and his voice cut in, clear and articulate, upon the dazed stupor of the wretched soldiers. "Have another try."</p> 
<p>A general groan and shudder passed through the row of carabineers. Each man had aimed aside, with a secret hope that the death-shot would come from his neighbour's hand, not his; and there the Gadfly stood and smiled at them; they had only turned the execution into a butchery, and the whole ghastly business was to do again. They were seized with sudden terror, and, lowering their carbines, listened hopelessly to the furious curses and reproaches of the officers, staring in dull horror at the man whom they had killed and who somehow was not dead.</p> 
<p>The Governor shook his fist in their faces, savagely shouting to them to stand in position, to present arms, to make haste and get the thing over. He had become as thoroughly demoralized as they were, and dared not look at the terrible figure that stood, and stood, and would not fall. When the Gadfly spoke to him he started and shuddered at the sound of the mocking voice.</p> 
<p>"You have brought out the awkward squad this morning, colonel! Let me see if I can manage them better. Now, men! Hold your tool higher there, you to the left. Bless your heart, man, it's a carbine you've got in your hand, not a frying-pan! Are you all straight? Now then! Ready--present----"</p> 
<p>"Fire!" the colonel interrupted, starting forward. It was intolerable that this man should give the command for his own death.</p> 
<p>There was another confused, disorganized volley, and the line broke up into a knot of shivering figures, staring before them with wild eyes. One of the soldiers had not even discharged his carbine; he had flung it away, and crouched down, moaning under his breath: "I can't--I can't!"</p> 
<p>The smoke cleared slowly away, floating up into the glimmer of the early sunlight; and they saw that the Gadfly had fallen; and saw, too, that he was still not dead. For the first moment soldiers and officials stood as if they had been turned to stone, and watched the ghastly thing that writhed and struggled on the ground; then both doctor and colonel rushed forward with a cry, for he had dragged himself up on one knee and was still facing the soldiers, and still laughing.</p> 
<p>"Another miss! Try--again, lads--see--if you can't----"</p> 
<p>He suddenly swayed and fell over sideways on the grass.</p> 
<p>"Is he dead?" the colonel asked under his breath; and the doctor, kneeling down, with a hand on the bloody shirt, answered softly:</p> 
<p>"I think so--God be praised!"</p> 
<p>"God be praised!" the colonel repeated. "At last!"</p> 
<p>His nephew was touching him on the arm.</p> 
<p>"Uncle! It's the Cardinal! He's at the gate and wants to come in."</p> 
<p>"What? He can't come in--I won't have it! What are the guards about? Your Eminence----"</p> 
<p>The gate had opened and shut, and Montanelli was standing in the courtyard, looking before him with still and awful eyes.</p> 
<p>"Your Eminence! I must beg of you--this is not a fit sight for you! The execution is only just over; the body is not yet----"</p> 
<p>"I have come to look at him," Montanelli said. Even at the moment it struck the Governor that his voice and bearing were those of a sleep-walker.</p> 
<p>"Oh, my God!" one of the soldiers cried out suddenly; and the Governor glanced hastily back. Surely------</p> 
<p>The blood-stained heap on the grass had once more begun to struggle and moan. The doctor flung himself down and lifted the head upon his knee.</p> 
<p>"Make haste!" he cried in desperation. "You savages, make haste! Get it over, for God's sake! There's no bearing this!"</p> 
<p>Great jets of blood poured over his hands, and the convulsions of the figure that he held in his arms shook him, too, from head to foot. As he looked frantically round for help, the priest bent over his shoulder and put a crucifix to the lips of the dying man.</p> 
<p>"In the name of the Father and of the Son----"</p> 
<p>The Gadfly raised himself against the doctor's knee, and, with wide-open eyes, looked straight upon the crucifix.</p> 
<p>Slowly, amid hushed and frozen stillness, he lifted the broken right hand and pushed away the image. There was a red smear across its face.</p> 
<p>"Padre--is your--God--satisfied?"</p> 
<p>His head fell back on the doctor's arm.</p> 
<p>. . . . .</p> 
<p>"Your Eminence!"</p> 
<p>As the Cardinal did not awake from his stupor, Colonel Ferrari repeated, louder:</p> 
<p>"Your Eminence!"</p> 
<p>Montanelli looked up.</p> 
<p>"He is dead."</p> 
<p>"Quite dead, your Eminence. Will you not come away? This is a horrible sight."</p> 
<p>"He is dead," Montanelli repeated, and looked down again at the face. "I touched him; and he is dead."</p> 
<p>"What does he expect a man to be with half a dozen bullets in him?" the lieutenant whispered contemptuously; and the doctor whispered back. "I think the sight of the blood has upset him."</p> 
<p>The Governor put his hand firmly on Montanelli's arm.</p> 
<p>"Your Eminence--you had better not look at him any longer. Will you allow the chaplain to escort you home?"</p> 
<p>"Yes--I will go."</p> 
<p>He turned slowly from the blood-stained spot and walked away, the priest and sergeant following. At the gate he paused and looked back, with a ghostlike, still surprise.</p> 
<p>"He is dead."</p> 
<p>. . . . .</p> 
<p>A few hours later Marcone went up to a cottage on the hillside to tell Martini that there was no longer any need for him to throw away his life.</p> 
<p>All the preparations for a second attempt at rescue were ready, as the plot was much more simple than the former one. It had been arranged that on the following morning, as the Corpus Domini procession passed along the fortress hill, Martini should step forward out of the crowd, draw a pistol from his breast, and fire in the Governor's face. In the moment of wild confusion which would follow twenty armed men were to make a sudden rush at the gate, break into the tower, and, taking the turnkey with them by force, to enter the prisoner's cell and carry him bodily away, killing or overpowering everyone who interfered with them. From the gate they were to retire fighting, and cover the retreat of a second band of armed and mounted smugglers, who would carry him off into a safe hiding-place in the hills. The only person in the little group who knew nothing of the plan was Gemma; it had been kept from her at Martini's special desire. "She will break her heart over it soon enough," he had said.</p> 
<p>As the smuggler came in at the garden gate Martini opened the glass door and stepped out on to the verandah to meet him.</p> 
<p>"Any news, Marcone? Ah!"</p> 
<p>The smuggler had pushed back his broad-brimmed straw hat.</p> 
<p>They sat down together on the verandah. Not a word was spoken on either side. From the instant when Martini had caught sight of the face under the hat-brim he had understood.</p> 
<p>"When was it?" he asked after a long pause; and his own voice, in his ears, was as dull and wearisome as everything else.</p> 
<p>"This morning, at sunrise. The sergeant told me. He was there and saw it."</p> 
<p>Martini looked down and flicked a stray thread from his coat-sleeve.</p> 
<p>Vanity of vanities; this also is vanity. He was to have died to-morrow. And now the land of his heart's desire had vanished, like the fairyland of golden sunset dreams that fades away when the darkness comes; and he was driven back into the world of every day and every night--the world of Grassini and Galli, of ciphering and pamphleteering, of party squabbles between comrades and dreary intrigues among Austrian spies--of the old revolutionary mill-round that maketh the heart sick. And somewhere down at the bottom of his consciousness there was a great empty place; a place that nothing and no one would fill any more, now that the Gadfly was dead.</p> 
<p>Someone was asking him a question, and he raised his head, wondering what could be left that was worth the trouble of talking about.</p> 
<p>"What did you say?"</p> 
<p>"I was saying that of course you will break the news to her."</p> 
<p>Life, and all the horror of life, came back into Martini's face.</p> 
<p>"How can I tell her?" he cried out. "You might as well ask me to go and stab her. Oh, how can I tell her--how can I!"</p> 
<p>He had clasped both hands over his eyes; but, without seeing, he felt the smuggler start beside him, and looked up. Gemma was standing in the doorway.</p> 
<p>"Have you heard, Cesare?" she said. "It is all over. They have shot him."</p> 
<p>军事法庭于星期二上午开审。审判草草了结，仅仅流于形式，前后勉强只有二十分钟。的确没有什么可以消磨时间的。不准进行辩护，仅有的证人是负伤的暗探和军官，以及几名士兵，提前起草好了判决书。蒙泰尼里已经派人过来，转达了想要得到的非正式认可意见。法官</p> 
<p>（费拉里上校、本地龙骑兵少校和瑞士卫队的两名军官）没有多少事情可做。宣读了起诉书，证人作了证，判决书上签了字，随后郑重其事地向犯人宣读了一遍。犯人默默地听着。根据惯例问了他有什么话要说，他只是不耐烦地挥了挥手，打发了这个问题。蒙泰尼里丢下的手帕藏在他的胸前。昨夜他一直吻着手帕哭泣，仿佛它是一个活人。现在他看上去憔悴不堪，无精打采；眼睑上还有泪痕。但是“枪毙”这个词并没有给他造成多大的影响。念出这个词的时候，他的瞳孔放大了一些，也就仅此而已。</p> 
<p>“把他押回牢房。”统领在所有的形式结束以后说道。军曹显然快要哭出来，他碰了一下牛虻的肩膀。牛虻一直纹丝不动地坐在那里。他微微一惊，随即转过身来。</p> 
<p>“啊，是，”他说，“我忘了。”</p> 
<p>统领的脸上似乎流露出了一丝怜悯之情。他本性不是一个残忍的人，对于他在这个月里的所作所为，他私下感到有些羞愧。现在想办的事已经办成，所以他愿意在其权力范围内作出每一个小小的让步。</p> 
<p>“你不必再戴上镣烤了。”他说，同时瞥了一眼牛虻淤血红肿的手腕。“他可以待在自己的牢房里。死囚室黑咕隆咚的，而且阴沉沉的。”他补充说道，随即转向他的侄子，“这事真的仅是一个形式。”他连连咳嗽，并且变换站立的姿势，显然感到局促不安。他随后叫回正押着犯人离开房间的军曹。“等等，军曹。我想跟他说句话。”</p> 
<p>牛虻动也没动，对于统领的话没有任何反应。</p> 
<p>“如果你想给你的朋友和亲人作个交代——我想，你有亲人吧？”</p> 
<p>没有回答。</p> 
<p>“好吧，想一想再告诉我，或者告诉牧师。我负责给你照办。你最好还是找牧师吧，他马上就来，他会陪你过夜。如果还有别的愿望——”</p> 
<p>牛虻抬起了头。</p> 
<p>“告诉牧师我宁愿一个人待着。我没有朋友，也没有什么要交代的。”</p> 
<p>“但是你要忏悔呀。”</p> 
<p>“我是个无神论者。我只要安静，不要别人打扰。”</p> 
<p>他说话时声音单调而又平静，既没有蔑视也没有生气。他缓慢地转过身去，他在门口又停下了脚步。</p> 
<p>“我忘了，上校。我想求你一件事。请你明天别让他们把我绑起来，也不要蒙住我的眼睛。我会安安稳稳地站在那里。”</p> 
<p>星期三早晨日出的时候，他们把他带进了院子。他的腿比平时瘸得更加明显，他走起路来显然困难，而且疼得厉害。</p> 
<p>他重重地依靠在军曹的胳膊上。但是那种倦怠的温顺已从他的脸上消失。曾在空荡荡的黑暗之中把他压垮的幽灵般的恐怖，那个阴影世界的幻象和噩梦，随同产生这一切的黑夜荡然无存。一旦太阳升起，他的敌人出来就会激起他的战斗精神，他就无所畏惧。</p> 
<p>执行枪决的六名士兵扛着短筒马枪，靠着长满常青藤的墙壁站成一排。越狱未遂的那天晚上，他曾爬上这堵满是窟窿且摇摇欲坠的墙壁。他们站在一起几乎无法忍住不哭，每个人的手里都拿着短筒马枪。竟派他们枪毙牛虻，他们觉得这是一件令人亡魂丧胆的事情，简直难以想象。他和他那尖刻反击，他那没完没了的笑声，他那豪爽且易感染他人的勇气，全都注入到了他们沉闷而又贫乏的生活之中，就像游离的阳光。他将要死去，而且是死在他们手里，这对他们来说仿佛是泯灭天堂里的明灯。</p> 
<p>院子里那棵硕大的无花果树下，他的坟墓正等候着他。这是不情愿的人昨夜挖成的，泪水曾经落在铁锹上。当他走过时，他低下了头，面带微笑。看着这个黑色的土穴和旁边正在枯萎的茅草，他长长地吸了一口气，闻着刚刚翻过的泥土的清香。</p> 
<p>军曹在大树附近停下了脚步，牛虻回过头来，露出最灿烂的笑容。</p> 
<p>“军曹，我就站在这儿吗？”</p> 
<p>那人默默地点了点头；他的喉咙有些哽咽，他说不上什么话，救不了他的命。统领、他的侄子、指挥枪决的马枪兵中尉、一名医生和一名牧师都已站在院子里，他们一脸严肃地走上前来。看到牛虻含笑的眼睛荡漾出铮铮傲气，他们都有点不知所措。</p> 
<p>“早安，先生们！啊，尊敬的牧师这么早也来了！上尉，你好吗？这次可比我们上次见面愉快一些，对不对？我看见你还吊着膀子呢，这是因为我那枪没打准。这帮好汉会打得更准——小伙子们，对吗？”</p> 
<p>他瞥了一眼士兵们的阴郁面孔。</p> 
<p>“反正这次用不着悬带了。得了，得了，不要为了这事闹得凄凄惨惨！并起你们的脚跟，显示一下你们的枪法。要不了多长时间，你们会有更多的工作去做，多得连你们都不知道怎样才能完成，事前可是没有练习的机会。”</p> 
<p>“我的孩子。”牧师上前打断了他的话，同时其他的人退后，留下他们单独交谈。“几分钟以后，你就到了造物主的跟前。留给你忏悔的最后几分钟，你就不能做点别的？我请求你想一想，如果不去忏悔，头顶所有的罪恶，躺在那里是件多么可怕的事情。等你站在你的审判者跟前，再想忏悔可就太晚了。难道你打算满嘴开着玩笑，走近他那威严的神座吗？”</p> 
<p>“尊敬的牧师，你是说笑话吗？我看你们才会需要这个小小的训条。轮到我们的时候，我们将会动用大炮，而不是六支破旧的短筒马枪，那时你就会看出我们要开多大的玩笑。”</p> 
<p>“你们将会动用大炮！噢，不幸的人啊！你仍旧执迷不悟，没有认识到你是站在深渊的边缘吗？”</p> 
<p>牛虻扭过头去看了一眼敞开的坟墓。</p> 
<p>“这、这、这么说来，尊敬的牧师认为等你们把我抛到里面，你们就算处置了我吗？也许你还会放上一块石头，防、防、防止死后三天复、复活吧？不用害怕，尊敬的牧师！我不会侵犯廉价表演的专利。我会像一只老、老鼠一样，安静地躺在你们把我抛下的地方。不管怎样，我们都会动用大炮。”</p> 
<p>“噢，仁慈的上帝，”牧师叫道。“原谅这个可怜的人吧！”</p> 
<p>“阿门！”马枪兵中尉喃喃地说道，声音低沉而又浑厚。与此同时，上校和他的侄子虔诚地画着十字。</p> 
<p>因为再坚持下去显然也没有什么效果，所以牧师放弃了徒劳的努力。他走到旁边，摇头晃脑，吟诵着一段祈祷文。简短的准备工作没多耽搁，随后就告结束。牛虻自动站在指定的位置，只是回头望了一会儿绚丽的日出。他再次要求不要蒙住他的眼睛，他那傲气凛然的面庞迫使上校不情愿地表示同意。他们俩都忘记了他们是在折磨那些士兵。</p> 
<p>他笑盈盈地面对他们站着，短筒马枪在他们手中抖动。</p> 
<p>“我已经准备好了。”他说。</p> 
<p>中尉跨步向前，激动得有些颤抖。他以前没有下令执行过死刑。</p> 
<p>“预备——举枪——射击！”</p> 
<p>牛虻晃了几下，随即恢复了平衡。一颗子弹打偏了，擦破了他的面颊，几滴鲜血落到白色的围巾上。另一颗子弹打在膝盖的上部。烟雾散去以后，士兵们看见他仍在微笑，正用那只残疾的手擦拭面颊上的鲜血。</p> 
<p>“伙计们，打得太差了！”他说。他的声音清晰而又响亮，那些可怜的士兵目瞪口呆。“再来一次。”</p> 
<p>这排马枪兵发出一片呻吟声，他们瑟瑟发抖。每一个人都往一边瞄准，私下希望致命的子弹是他旁边的人射出，而不是他射出。牛虻站在那里，冲着他们微笑。他们只把枪决变成了屠杀，这件可怕的事情将要再次开始。突然之间，他们失魂落魄。他们放下短筒马枪，无奈地听着军官愤怒的咒骂和训斥，惊恐万状地瞪着已被他们枪决但却没被杀死的人。</p> 
<p>统领冲着他们的脸晃动他的拳头，恶狠狠地喝令他们各就位并且举枪，快点结束这件事情。他和他们一样心慌意乱，不敢去看站着不倒的那个可怕的形象。当牛虻跟他说话时，听到那个冷嘲热讽的声音，他吓了一跳，浑身发抖。</p> 
<p>“上校，你带来了一支蹩脚的行刑队！我来看看能否把他们调理好些。好了，伙计们！把你的工具举高一些，你往左一点。打起精神来，伙计，你拿的是马枪，不是煎锅！你们全都准备好啦？那么来吧！预备——举枪——”</p> 
<p>“射击！”上校冲上前来抢先喊道。这个家伙居然下令执行自己的死刑，真是让人受不了。</p> 
<p>又一阵杂乱无章的齐射。随后队形就打散了，瑟瑟发抖的士兵挤成了一团，瞪大眼睛向前张望。有个士兵甚至没有开枪，他丢下了马枪，蹲下身体呻吟：“我不能——我不能！”</p> 
<p>烟雾慢慢散去，然后冉冉上升，融入到晨曦之中。他们看见牛虻已经倒下，他们看见他还没有死。零时间，士兵和军官站在那里，仿佛变成了石头。他们望着那个可怕的东西在地上扭动挣扎。接着医生和上校跑上前去，惊叫一声，因为他支着一只膝盖撑起自己，仍旧面对士兵，仍旧放声大笑。</p> 
<p>“又没打中！再——一次，小伙子们——看看——如果你们不能——”</p> 
<p>他突然摇晃起来，然后就往一侧倒在草上。</p> 
<p>“他死了吗？”上校小声问道。医生跪下身来，一只手搭在血淋淋的衬衣上，轻声回答：“我看是吧——感谢上帝！”</p> 
<p>“感谢上帝！”上校重复说道。“总算完了！”</p> 
<p>他的侄子碰了一下他的胳膊。</p> 
<p>“叔叔！红衣主教来了！他就在门口，想要进来。”</p> 
<p>“什么？他不能进来——我不让他进来！卫兵在干什么？主教阁下——”</p> 
<p>大门开了以后又关上，蒙泰尼里站在院子里，直愣愣地望着前方。</p> 
<p>“主教阁下！必须请您原谅——这个场面对您并不合宜！枪决刚刚结束，尸体还没——”</p> 
<p>“我是来看他的。”蒙泰尼里说道。统领这时感到有些奇怪，从他的声音和举止看来，他像是一个梦游的人。</p> 
<p>“噢，我的上帝！”一名士兵突然叫了起来，统领匆忙扭头看去。果然——</p> 
<p>草地上那个血肉模糊的身躯再次开始挣扎，并且呻吟起来。医生伏下身去，托着牛虻的脑袋放到自己的膝上。</p> 
<p>“快点！”他绝望地叫道。“你们这些野蛮的人，快点！看在上帝的份上，结束这事吧！真叫人受不了！”</p> 
<p>大量的鲜血涌到他的手上，在他怀中的躯体不住地抽搐，致使他也浑身颤抖。他发疯似的四下张望，想找个人帮忙。这时牧师从他肩上俯下身来，把十字架放到濒于死亡的人的嘴唇上。</p> 
<p>“以圣父和圣子的名义——”</p> 
<p>牛虻靠着医生的膝盖抬起身子，睁大眼睛直视十字架。</p> 
<p>哑然无声的寂静之中，他缓慢地举起已被打断的右手，推开了那个十字架。耶稣的脸上被抹上了鲜血。</p> 
<p>“Padre——您的——上帝——满意了？”</p> 
<p>他仰头倒在医生的胳膊上。</p> 
<p>“主教阁下！”</p> 
<p>因为红衣主教还没从恍惚之中清醒过来，所以上校又喊了一遍，声音更大。</p> 
<p>“主教阁下！”</p> 
<p>蒙泰尼里抬起了头。</p> 
<p>“他死了。”</p> 
<p>“确实死了，主教阁下。您不回去吗？这种场面真是可怕。”</p> 
<p>“他死了。”蒙泰尼里重复说道，并且再次俯身看着那张脸。“我碰过他，他死了。”</p> 
<p>“身中六发子弹的人，你还指望他能活吗？”中尉轻蔑地小声说道。医生低声回答：“我想见到了流血，他有些惶恐不安。”</p> 
<p>统领紧紧地抓住蒙泰尼里的胳膊。</p> 
<p>“主教阁下——您最好还是不要再看他了。您允许牧师送您回家吗？”</p> 
<p>“是——我就走。”</p> 
<p>他缓缓转身离开了那块血迹斑斑的地方，后面跟着牧师和军曹。他在大门口停下了脚步，回过头来，带着幽灵一般的平静和惊愕。</p> 
<p>几个小时以后，马尔科尼走进山坡上的一座小屋，告诉马尔蒂尼再也没有必要去拼命了。</p> 
<p>第二次营救的所有准备工作全部完毕，因为计划比前一个计划简单一些。安排第二天上午，当迎圣体节的游行队伍经过城堡所在的小山时，马尔蒂尼应该冲出人群，从胸前拔出手枪，对着统领的脸上开枪。在随后的混乱中，二十名武装人员突然冲向大门，撞进城堡，强迫看守就范，进入犯人的牢房，然后把他背走，杀死或者制服任何企图干涉的人。他们从大门处边打边撤，掩护另外一队骑马的武装私贩子撤退。</p> 
<p>第二队人马把他送到山里隐藏起来。他们这一小拨人中只有琼玛对这个计划一无所知，这是根据马尔蒂尼的特别要求才瞒住她的。“听到这个计划，马上她就会伤心欲绝。”</p> 
<p>当那位私贩子走进花园时，马尔蒂尼打开玻璃院门，走出游廊迎接他。</p> 
<p>“马尔科尼，有什么消息吗？啊！”</p> 
<p>私贩子把宽边草帽推到脑后。</p> 
<p>他们一起坐在游廊里。他们俩都没有说话。马尔蒂尼见到帽檐下面的那张脸后，随即明白了怎么回事。</p> 
<p>“什么时候？”沉默良久以后他说，那声音听上去沉闷而又倦怠。</p> 
<p>“今天早晨，日出的时候。军曹告诉我的。他就在那里，亲眼所见。”</p> 
<p>马尔蒂尼低下头去，从他的外套袖子里抽出了一根散纱。</p> 
<p>虚伪之虚伪，这也是虚伪。他准备明天死去。现在，他的内心意欲前往的世界已经消失，就像在黑暗降临的时候，布满晚霞般美梦的仙境随之消失一样。他被赶回到日复一日、夜复一夜的世界——这里存在格拉西尼和加利，这里存在密写书信和油印小册子，这里存在党内同志之间的争执和奥地利暗探的阴谋诡计——使人心力交瘁的革命老一套。在他的意识深处有一片偌大的空地，一个荒芜的地方，既然牛虻已经死了，那就没人填满这个地方了。</p> 
<p>有人向他提了一个问题，他抬起了头，纳闷还有什么值得谈的。</p> 
<p>“你说什么？”</p> 
<p>“我是说当然是你把消息告诉她。”</p> 
<p>马尔蒂尼的脸上出现了生气，但也露出莫大的恐怖。</p> 
<p>“我怎么能去告诉她呢？”他叫道。“你还不如叫我去用刀把她杀死。噢，我怎么能去告诉她——我怎么能呢？”</p> 
<p>他握紧双手捂住他的眼睛。尽管没有看见，但是他还是感到身旁的私贩子吓了一跳，于是他抬起了头。琼玛正好站在门口。</p> 
<p>“塞萨雷，你听说了吗？”她说，“什么都完了。他们把他枪毙了。”</p>
