<p>ONE evening in July, 1846, a few acquaintances met at Professor Fabrizi's house in Florence to discuss plans for future political work.</p> 
<p>Several of them belonged to the Mazzinian party and would have been satisfied with nothing less than a democratic Republic and a United Italy. Others were Constitutional Monarchists and Liberals of various shades. On one point, however, they were all agreed; that of dissatisfaction with the Tuscan censorship; and the popular professor had called the meeting in the hope that, on this one subject at least, the representatives of the dissentient parties would be able to get through an hour's discussion without quarrelling.</p> 
<p>Only a fortnight had elapsed since the famous amnesty which Pius IX. had granted, on his accession, to political offenders in the Papal States; but the wave of liberal enthusiasm caused by it was already spreading over Italy. In Tuscany even the government appeared to have been affected by the astounding event. It had occurred to Fabrizi and a few other leading Florentines that this was a propitious moment for a bold effort to reform the press-laws.</p> 
<p>"Of course," the dramatist Lega had said, when the subject was first broached to him; "it would be impossible to start a newspaper till we can get the press-law changed; we should not bring out the first number. But we may be able to run some pamphlets through the censorship already; and the sooner we begin the sooner we shall get the law changed."</p> 
<p>He was now explaining in Fabrizi's library his theory of the line which should be taken by liberal writers at the moment.</p> 
<p>"There is no doubt," interposed one of the company, a gray-haired barrister with a rather drawling manner of speech, "that in some way we must take advantage of the moment. We shall not see such a favourable one again for bringing forward serious reforms. But I doubt the pamphlets doing any good. They will only irritate and frighten the government instead of winning it over to our side, which is what we really want to do. If once the authorities begin to think of us as dangerous agitators our chance of getting their help is gone."</p> 
<p>"Then what would you have us do?"</p> 
<p>"Petition."</p> 
<p>"To the Grand Duke?"</p> 
<p>"Yes; for an augmentation of the liberty of the press."</p> 
<p>A keen-looking, dark man sitting by the window turned his head round with a laugh.</p> 
<p>"You'll get a lot out of petitioning!" he said. "I should have thought the result of the Renzi case was enough to cure anybody of going to work that way."</p> 
<p>"My dear sir, I am as much grieved as you are that we did not succeed in preventing the extradition of Renzi. But really--I do not wish to hurt the sensibilities of anyone, but I cannot help thinking that our failure in that case was largely due to the impatience and vehemence of some persons among our number. I should certainly hesitate----"</p> 
<p>"As every Piedmontese always does," the dark man interrupted sharply. "I don't know where the vehemence and impatience lay, unless you found them in the strings of meek petitions we sent in. That may be vehemence for Tuscany or Piedmont, but we should not call it particularly vehement in Naples."</p> 
<p>"Fortunately," remarked the Piedmontese, "Neapolitan vehemence is peculiar to Naples."</p> 
<p>"There, there, gentlemen, that will do!" the professor put in. "Neapolitan customs are very good things in their way and Piedmontese customs in theirs; but just now we are in Tuscany, and the Tuscan custom is to stick to the matter in hand. Grassini votes for petitions and Galli against them. What do you think, Dr. Riccardo?"</p> 
<p>"I see no harm in petitions, and if Grassini gets one up I'll sign it with all the pleasure in life. But I don't think mere petitioning and nothing else will accomplish much. Why can't we have both petitions and pamphlets?"</p> 
<p>"Simply because the pamphlets will put the government into a state of mind in which it won't grant the petitions," said Grassini.</p> 
<p>"It won't do that anyhow." The Neapolitan rose and came across to the table. "Gentlemen, you're on the wrong tack. Conciliating the government will do no good. What we must do is to rouse the people."</p> 
<p>"That's easier said than done; how are you going to start?"</p> 
<p>"Fancy asking Galli that! Of course he'd start by knocking the censor on the head."</p> 
<p>"No, indeed, I shouldn't," said Galli stoutly. "You always think if a man comes from down south he must believe in no argument but cold steel."</p> 
<p>"Well, what do you propose, then? Sh! Attention, gentlemen! Galli has a proposal to make."</p> 
<p>The whole company, which had broken up into little knots of twos and threes, carrying on separate discussions, collected round the table to listen. Galli raised his hands in expostulation.</p> 
<p>"No, gentlemen, it is not a proposal; it is merely a suggestion. It appears to me that there is a great practical danger in all this rejoicing over the new Pope. People seem to think that, because he has struck out a new line and granted this amnesty, we have only to throw ourselves-- all of us, the whole of Italy--into his arms and he will carry us to the promised land. Now, I am second to no one in admiration of the Pope's behaviour; the amnesty was a splendid action."</p> 
<p>"I am sure His Holiness ought to feel flattered----" Grassini began contemptuously.</p> 
<p>"There, Grassini, do let the man speak!" Riccardo interrupted in his turn. "It's a most extraordinary thing that you two never can keep from sparring like a cat and dog. Get on, Galli!"</p> 
<p>"What I wanted to say is this," continued the Neapolitan. "The Holy Father, undoubtedly, is acting with the best intentions; but how far he will succeed in carrying his reforms is another question. Just now it's smooth enough and, of course, the reactionists all over Italy will lie quiet for a month or two till the excitement about the amnesty blows over; but they are not likely to let the power be taken out of their hands without a fight, and my own belief is that before the winter is half over we shall have Jesuits and Gregorians and Sanfedists and all the rest of the crew about our ears, plotting and intriguing, and poisoning off everybody they can't bribe."</p> 
<p>"That's likely enough."</p> 
<p>"Very well, then; shall we wait here, meekly sending in petitions, till Lambruschini and his pack have persuaded the Grand Duke to put us bodily under Jesuit rule, with perhaps a few Austrian hussars to patrol the streets and keep us in order; or shall we forestall them and take advantage of their momentary discomfiture to strike the first blow?"</p> 
<p>"Tell us first what blow you propose?"</p> 
<p>"I would suggest that we start an organized propaganda and agitation against the Jesuits."</p> 
<p>"A pamphleteering declaration of war, in fact?"</p> 
<p>"Yes; exposing their intrigues, ferreting out their secrets, and calling upon the people to make common cause against them."</p> 
<p>"But there are no Jesuits here to expose."</p> 
<p>"Aren't there? Wait three months and see how many we shall have. It'll be too late to keep them out then."</p> 
<p>"But really to rouse the town against the Jesuits one must speak plainly; and if you do that how will you evade the censorship?"</p> 
<p>"I wouldn't evade it; I would defy it."</p> 
<p>"You would print the pamphlets anonymously? That's all very well, but the fact is, we have all seen enough of the clandestine press to know----"</p> 
<p>"I did not mean that. I would print the pamphlets openly, with our names and addresses, and let them prosecute us if they dare."</p> 
<p>"The project is a perfectly mad one," Grassini exclaimed. "It is simply putting one's head into the lion's mouth out of sheer wantonness."</p> 
<p>"Oh, you needn't be afraid!" Galli cut in sharply; "we shouldn't ask you to go to prison for our pamphlets."</p> 
<p>"Hold your tongue, Galli!" said Riccardo. "It's not a question of being afraid; we're all as ready as you are to go to prison if there's any good to be got by it, but it is childish to run into danger for nothing. For my part, I have an amendment to the proposal to suggest."</p> 
<p>"Well, what is it?"</p> 
<p>"I think we might contrive, with care, to fight the Jesuits without coming into collision with the censorship."</p> 
<p>"I don't see how you are going to manage it."</p> 
<p>"I think that it is possible to clothe what one has to say in so roundabout a form that----"</p> 
<p>"That the censorship won't understand it? And then you'll expect every poor artisan and labourer to find out the meaning by the light of the ignorance and stupidity that are in him! That doesn't sound very practicable."</p> 
<p>"Martini, what do you think?" asked the professor, turning to a broad-shouldered man with a great brown beard, who was sitting beside him.</p> 
<p>"I think that I will reserve my opinion till I have more facts to go upon. It's a question of trying experiments and seeing what comes of them."</p> 
<p>"And you, Sacconi?"</p> 
<p>"I should like to hear what Signora Bolla has to say. Her suggestions are always valuable."</p> 
<p>Everyone turned to the only woman in the room, who had been sitting on the sofa, resting her chin on one hand and listening in silence to the discussion. She had deep, serious black eyes, but as she raised them now there was an unmistakable gleam of amusement in them.</p> 
<p>"I am afraid," she said; "that I disagree with everybody."</p> 
<p>"You always do, and the worst of it is that you are always right," Riccardo put in.</p> 
<p>"I think it is quite true that we must fight the Jesuits somehow; and if we can't do it with one weapon we must with another. But mere defiance is a feeble weapon and evasion a cumbersome one. As for petitioning, that is a child's toy."</p> 
<p>"I hope, signora," Grassini interposed, with a solemn face; "that you are not suggesting such methods as--assassination?"</p> 
<p>Martini tugged at his big moustache and Galli sniggered outright. Even the grave young woman could not repress a smile.</p> 
<p>"Believe me," she said, "that if I were ferocious enough to think of such things I should not be childish enough to talk about them. But the deadliest weapon I know is ridicule. If you can once succeed in rendering the Jesuits ludicrous, in making people laugh at them and their claims, you have conquered them without bloodshed."</p> 
<p>"I believe you are right, as far as that goes," Fabrizi said; "but I don't see how you are going to carry the thing through."</p> 
<p>"Why should we not be able to carry it through?" asked Martini. "A satirical thing has a better chance of getting over the censorship difficulty than a serious one; and, if it must be cloaked, the average reader is more likely to find out the double meaning of an apparently silly joke than of a scientific or economic treatise."</p> 
<p>"Then is your suggestion, signora, that we should issue satirical pamphlets, or attempt to run a comic paper? That last, I am sure, the censorship would never allow."</p> 
<p>"I don't mean exactly either. I believe a series of small satirical leaflets, in verse or prose, to be sold cheap or distributed free about the streets, would be very useful. If we could find a clever artist who would enter into the spirit of the thing, we might have them illustrated."</p> 
<p>"It's a capital idea, if only one could carry it out; but if the thing is to be done at all it must be well done. We should want a first-class satirist; and where are we to get him?"</p> 
<p>"You see," added Lega, "most of us are serious writers; and, with all respect to the company, I am afraid that a general attempt to be humorous would present the spectacle of an elephant trying to dance the tarantella."</p> 
<p>"I never suggested that we should all rush into work for which we are unfitted. My idea was that we should try to find a really gifted satirist-- there must be one to be got somewhere in Italy, surely--and offer to provide the necessary funds. Of course we should have to know something of the man and make sure that he would work on lines with which we could agree."</p> 
<p>"But where are you going to find him? I can count up the satirists of any real talent on the fingers of one hand; and none of them are available. Giusti wouldn't accept; he is fully occupied as it is. There are one or two good men in Lombardy, but they write only in the Milanese dialect----"</p> 
<p>"And moreover," said Grassini, "the Tuscan people can be influenced in better ways than this. I am sure that it would be felt as, to say the least, a want of political savoir faire if we were to treat this solemn question of civil and religious liberty as a subject for trifling. Florence is not a mere wilderness of factories and money-getting like London, nor a haunt of idle luxury like Paris. It is a city with a great history------"</p> 
<p>"So was Athens," she interrupted, smiling; "but it was 'rather sluggish from its size and needed a gadfly to rouse it'----"</p> 
<p>Riccardo struck his hand upon the table. "Why, we never thought of the Gadfly! The very man!"</p> 
<p>"Who is that?"</p> 
<p>"The Gadfly--Felice Rivarez. Don't you remember him? One of Muratori's band that came down from the Apennines three years ago?"</p> 
<p>"Oh, you knew that set, didn't you? I remember your travelling with them when they went on to Paris."</p> 
<p>"Yes; I went as far as Leghorn to see Rivarez off for Marseilles. He wouldn't stop in Tuscany; he said there was nothing left to do but laugh, once the insurrection had failed, and so he had better go to Paris. No doubt he agreed with Signor Grassini that Tuscany is the wrong place to laugh in. But I am nearly sure he would come back if we asked him, now that there is a chance of doing something in Italy."</p> 
<p>"What name did you say?"</p> 
<p>"Rivarez. He's a Brazilian, I think. At any rate, I know he has lived out there. He is one of the wittiest men I ever came across. Heaven knows we had nothing to be merry over, that week in Leghorn; it was enough to break one's heart to look at poor Lambertini; but there was no keeping one's countenance when Rivarez was in the room; it was one perpetual fire of absurdities. He had a nasty sabre-cut across the face, too; I remember sewing it up. He's an odd creature; but I believe he and his nonsense kept some of those poor lads from breaking down altogether."</p> 
<p>"Is that the man who writes political skits in the French papers under the name of 'Le Taon'?"</p> 
<p>"Yes; short paragraphs mostly, and comic feuilletons. The smugglers up in the Apennines called him 'the Gadfly' because of his tongue; and he took the nickname to sign his work with."</p> 
<p>"I know something about this gentleman," said Grassini, breaking in upon the conversation in his slow and stately manner; "and I cannot say that what I have heard is much to his credit. He undoubtedly possesses a certain showy, superficial cleverness, though I think his abilities have been exaggerated; and possibly he is not lacking in physical courage; but his reputation in Paris and Vienna is, I believe, very far from spotless. He appears to be a gentleman of--a--a--many adventures and unknown antecedents. It is said that he was picked up out of charity by Duprez's expedition somewhere in the wilds of tropical South America, in a state of inconceivable savagery and degradation. I believe he has never satisfactorily explained how he came to be in such a condition. As for the rising in the Apennines, I fear it is no</p> 
<p>101</p> 
<p>secret that persons of all characters took part in that unfortunate affair. The men who were executed in Bologna are known to have been nothing but common malefactors; and the character of many who escaped will hardly bear description. Without doubt, SOME of the participators were men of high character----"</p> 
<p>"Some of them were the intimate friends of several persons in this room!" Riccardo interrupted, with an angry ring in his voice. "It's all very well to be particular and exclusive, Grassini; but these 'common malefactors' died for their belief, which is more than you or I have done as yet."</p> 
<p>"And another time when people tell you the stale gossip of Paris," added Galli, "you can tell them from me that they are mistaken about the Duprez expedition. I know Duprez's adjutant, Martel, personally, and have heard the whole story from him. It's true that they found Rivarez stranded out there. He had been taken prisoner in the war, fighting for the Argentine Republic, and had escaped. He was wandering about the country in various disguises, trying to get back to Buenos Ayres. But the story of their taking him on out of charity is a pure fabrication. Their interpreter had fallen ill and been obliged to turn back; and not one of the Frenchmen could speak the native languages; so they offered him the post, and he spent the whole three years with them, exploring the tributaries of the Amazon. Martel told me he believed they never would have got through the expedition at all if it had not been for Rivarez."</p> 
<p>"Whatever he may be," said Fabrizi; "there must be something remarkable about a man who could lay his 'come hither' on two old campaigners like Martel and Duprez as he seems to have done. What do you think, signora?"</p> 
<p>"I know nothing about the matter; I was in England when the fugitives passed through Tuscany. But I should think that if the companions who were with a man on a three years' expedition in savage countries, and the comrades who were with him through an insurrection, think well of him, that is recommendation enough to counterbalance a good deal of boulevard gossip."</p> 
<p>"There is no question about the opinion his comrades had of him," said Riccardo. "From Muratori and Zambeccari down to the roughest mountaineers they were all devoted to him. Moreover, he is a personal friend of Orsini. It's quite true, on the other hand, that there are endless cock-and-bull stories of a not very pleasant kind going about concerning him in Paris; but if a man doesn't want to make enemies he shouldn't become a political satirist."</p> 
<p>"I'm not quite sure," interposed Lega; "but it seems to me that I saw him once when the refugees were here. Was he not hunchbacked, or crooked, or something of that kind?"</p> 
<p>The professor had opened a drawer in his writing-table and was turning over a heap of papers. "I think I have his police description somewhere here," he said. "You remember when they escaped and hid in the mountain passes their personal appearance was posted up everywhere, and that Cardinal--what's the scoundrel's name?-- Spinola, offered a reward for their heads."</p> 
<p>"There was a splendid story about Rivarez and that police paper, by the way. He put on a soldier's old uniform and tramped across country as a carabineer wounded in the discharge of his duty and trying to find his company. He actually got Spinola's search-party to give him a lift, and rode the whole day in one of their waggons, telling them harrowing stories of how he had been taken captive by the rebels and dragged off into their haunts in the mountains, and of the fearful tortures that he had suffered at their hands. They showed him the description paper, and he told them all the rubbish he could think of about 'the fiend they call the Gadfly.' Then at night, when they were asleep, he poured a bucketful of water into their powder and decamped, with his pockets full of provisions and ammunition------"</p> 
<p>"Ah, here's the paper," Fabrizi broke in: "'Felice Rivarez, called: The Gadfly. Age, about 30; birthplace and parentage, unknown, probably South American; profession, journalist. Short; black hair; black beard; dark skin; eyes, blue; forehead, broad and square; nose, mouth, chin------' Yes, here it is: 'Special marks: right foot lame; left arm twisted; two ringers missing on left hand; recent sabre-cut across face; stammers.' Then there's a note put: 'Very expert shot; care should be taken in arresting.'"</p> 
<p>"It's an extraordinary thing that he can have managed to deceive the search-party with such a formidable list of identification marks."</p> 
<p>"It was nothing but sheer audacity that carried him through, of course. If it had once occurred to them to suspect him he would have been lost. But the air of confiding innocence that he can put on when he chooses would bring a man through anything. Well, gentlemen, what do you think of the proposal? Rivarez seems to be pretty well known to several of the company. Shall we suggest to him that we should be glad of his help here or not?"</p> 
<p>"I think," said Fabrizi, "that he might be sounded upon the subject, just to find out whether he would be inclined to think of the plan."</p> 
<p>"Oh, he'll be inclined, you may be sure, once it's a case of fighting the Jesuits; he is the most savage anti-clerical I ever met; in fact, he's rather rabid on the point."</p> 
<p>"Then will you write, Riccardo?"</p> 
<p>"Certainly. Let me see, where is he now? In Switzerland, I think. He's the most restless being; always flitting about. But as for the pamphlet question----"</p> 
<p>They plunged into a long and animated discussion. When at last the company began to disperse Martini went up to the quiet young woman.</p> 
<p>"I will see you home, Gemma."</p> 
<p>"Thanks; I want to have a business talk with you."</p> 
<p>"Anything wrong with the addresses?" he asked softly.</p> 
<p>"Nothing serious; but I think it is time to make a few alterations. Two letters have been stopped in the post this week. They were both quite unimportant, and it may have been accidental; but we cannot afford to have any risks. If once the police have begun to suspect any of our addresses, they must be changed immediately."</p> 
<p>"I will come in about that to-morrow. I am not going to talk business with you to-night; you look tired."</p> 
<p>"I am not tired."</p> 
<p>"Then you are depressed again."</p> 
<p>"Oh, no; not particularly."</p> 
<p>十三年以后……</p> 
<p>１８４６年７月的一个晚上，几位熟人聚在佛罗伦萨的法布里齐教授家里，讨论今后开展政治工作的计划。</p> 
<p>他们当中有几个人属于玛志尼党，要是不建立一个民主共和国和一个联合的意大利，他们是不会感到满意的。其余的人当中有君主立宪党人，也有程度各异的自由主义分子。可是在有一点上，他们的意见是一致的。那就是他们不满托斯卡纳公国的报刊审查制度。于是这位知名的教授召集了这次会议，希望至少是在这个问题上，各个党派的代表能够不吵不闹，讨论上一个小时。</p> 
<p>自从庇护斯九世在即位之时颁布了那道著名的大赦令，释放教皇领地之内的政治犯以来，时间才过去了两个星期，但是由此引发的自由主义热潮已经席卷了整个意大利。在托斯卡纳公国，甚至连政府都显得已经受到了这一惊人事件的影响。在法布里齐和几位佛罗伦萨的名流看来，这是大胆改革新闻出版法的一个契机。</p> 
<p>“当然了，”在这个话题首先由他提出以后，戏剧家莱嘉曾经这么说道，“除非我们能够修改新闻出版法，否则就不可能创办报纸。我们连创刊号都应该出。但是我们也许能通过报刊审查制度出版一些小册子。我们越是尽早动手，就越是可能修改这条法律。”</p> 
<p>他正在法布里齐的书房里解释他那一番理论，他认为自由派的作家目前应该采取这条路线。</p> 
<p>“毫无疑问。”有人插嘴说道，这是一位头发花白的律师，说起话来慢吞吞的。“在某个方面，我们必须利用目前这样的机会了。我们可以借此推进切实的改革，以后再也不会出现这样一个有利的机会了。但是我对出版小册子有什么用表示怀疑。它们只会激怒政府，使得政府感到害怕，却不会把政府拉到我们这一边来，而这一点才是我们真正要做的事情。如果当局一旦开始认为我们是危险人物，尽搞些煽动活动，那么我们就没有机会得到当局的帮助了。”</p> 
<p>“那么你认为我们应该怎么办呢？”</p> 
<p>“请愿。”</p> 
<p>“是向大公请愿吗？”</p> 
<p>“对，要求放宽新闻出版自由的尺度。”</p> 
<p>靠窗坐着一个目光敏锐、肤色黝黑的人，他转过头笑出声来。</p> 
<p>“你去请愿会大有收获的！”他说。“我还以为伦齐一案的结果足以促使大家醒悟过来，再也不会那样做了。”</p> 
<p>“我亲爱的先生，我们没有成功地阻止引渡伦齐，我和你一样感到忧心如焚。但是说实在的——我并不希望伤害任何人的感情，但我还是认为我们这件事之所以失败，原因就是我们当中有些人没有耐心，言行过激。我当然不想——”</p> 
<p>“每个皮埃蒙特人都会这样，”那个肤色黝黑的人厉声地打断了他的话，“我并不知道有谁言行过激，没有耐心。我们呈交的一连串请愿书语气温和，除非你能从中挑出毛病来。在托斯卡纳和皮埃蒙特，这也许算是过激的言行，但是在那不勒斯，我们却并不把它当作是特别过激的言行。”</p> 
<p>“所幸的是，”那位皮埃蒙特人直言不讳地说道，“那不勒斯的过激言行只限于那不勒斯。”</p> 
<p>“行了，行了，先生们，到此为止！”教授插言说道。“那不勒斯的风俗习惯有其独到的长处，皮埃蒙特人的风俗习惯也一样。但是现在我们是在托斯卡纳，托斯卡纳的风俗习惯是抓紧处理眼前的事情。格拉西尼投票赞成请愿，加利则反对请愿。里卡尔多医生，你有什么看法？”</p> 
<p>“我看请愿没有什么坏处，如果格拉西尼起草好了一份，我会满心欢喜地签上我的名字。但是我认为不做其他的事情，光是请愿没有多大的作为。为什么我们不能既去请愿又去出版小册子呢？”</p> 
<p>“原因很简单，那些小册子会使政府无法接受请愿。”格拉西尼说道。</p> 
<p>“反正政府不会作出让步。”那位那不勒斯人起身走到桌旁。“先生们，你们采取的方法是不对的。迎合政府不会有什么好处。我们必须要做的事情就是唤起人民。”</p> 
<p>“说比做容易啊。可是你打算从何下手？”</p> 
<p>“没想过去问加利吧？他当然先把审查官的脑袋敲碎。”</p> 
<p>“不会的，我肯定不会那么做，”加利断然说道，“你总是认为如果一个人是从南方来的，那么他一定只相信冰冷的铁棍，而不相信说理。”</p> 
<p>“那好，你有什么提议呢？嘘！注意了，先生们！加利有个提议要说出来。”</p> 
<p>所有的人都已分成两人一伙三人一堆，一直都在分头进行讨论。这时他们围到了桌边，想要听个究竟。加利举起双手劝慰大家。</p> 
<p>“不，先生们，这不算是一个提议。只是一个建议。大家对新教皇的即位雀跃不已，在我看来实际上这是非常危险的。因为他已制订了一个新的方针，并且颁布了大赦，我们只须——我们大家，整个意大利——投入他的怀抱，他就会把我们带到乐土。现在我也和大家一样，对教皇的举动表示钦佩。大赦确实是一个了不起的行动。”</p> 
<p>“我相信教皇陛下肯定会感到受宠若惊——”格拉西尼带着鄙夷的口吻说道。</p> 
<p>“行了，格拉西尼，让他把话说完！”里卡尔多也插了一句。“要是你们俩不像猫和狗一样见面就咬，那才是一件天大的怪事呢。接着往下说，加利！”</p> 
<p>“我想要说的就是这一点，”那位那不勒斯人继续说道，“教皇陛下无疑是怀着最诚挚的本意，所以他才会采取这样的行动。但是他将把他的改革成功地推进到什么地步，那是另外一个问题。就现在来说，当然一切都很平静。在一两个月内，意大利全境的反动分子将会偃旗息鼓。他们会等着大赦产生的这股狂热劲儿过去。但是他们不大可能在不战之下就让别人从他们手中夺过权力。我本人相信今年冬天过不了一半，耶稣会、格列高利派、圣信会的教士们和其他的跳梁小丑就会对我们兴师动众，他们会密谋策划，对不能收买的人他们则将置于死地。”</p> 
<p>“很有这个可能。”</p> 
<p>“那好啊。我们要么坐在这里束手待毙，谦和地送去请愿书，直到兰姆勃鲁契尼及其死党劝说大公成功，按照耶稣会的法规将我们治罪。也许还会派出奥地利的几名轻骑兵在街上巡逻，为我们维护治安呢。要么我们就采取先发制人的措施，利用他们片刻的窘状抢先出击。”</p> 
<p>“首先告诉我们你提议怎么出击？”</p> 
<p>“我建议我们着手组织反耶稣会的宣传和鼓动工作。”</p> 
<p>“事实上就是用小册子宣战吗？”</p> 
<p>“是的，揭露他们的阴谋诡计，揭露他们的秘密，号召人民团结一致同他们斗争。”</p> 
<p>“但是这里并没有我们要揭露的耶稣会教士。”</p> 
<p>“没有吗？等上三个月，你就会看见有多少了。那时就会太迟了。”</p> 
<p>“但是要想唤起市民反对耶稣会教士，我们就必须直言不讳。可是如果这样，你能躲过审查制度吗？”</p> 
<p>“我才不去躲呢，我偏要违反审查制度。”</p> 
<p>“那么你要匿名印刷小册子？好倒是好，但是事实上我们已经看到了许多秘密出版物的下场，我们知道——”</p> 
<p>“我并不是这个意思。我会公开印刷小册子，标明我们的住址。如果他们敢的话，就让他们起诉我们好了。”</p> 
<p>“这完全是个疯狂的方案，”格拉西尼大声叫道，“这简直就是把脑袋送进狮子的嘴里，纯粹是胡来。”</p> 
<p>“嗬，你用不着害怕！”加利厉声说道，“为了我们的小册子，我们不会请你去坐牢的。”</p> 
<p>“住嘴，加利！”里卡尔多说道。“这不是一个害怕的问题。如果坐牢管用的话，我们都会像你一样准备去坐牢。但是不为了什么事而去冒险，那是幼稚之举。让我来说，我建议修正这项提议。”</p> 
<p>“那好，怎么说？”</p> 
<p>“我认为我们也许可以想出办法来，一方面谨慎地和耶稣会教士展开斗争，另一方面又不与审查制度发生冲突。”</p> 
<p>“我看不出你怎样才能做到这一点。”</p> 
<p>“我认为可以采用拐弯抹角的形式，掩盖我们必须表达的意思——”</p> 
<p>“那样就审查不出来吗？然后你就指望每一个贫穷的手工艺者和出卖苦力的人靠着无知和愚昧来探寻其中的意思！这听起来一点也行不通。”</p> 
<p>“马尔蒂尼，你的看法呢？”教授转身问坐在旁边的那个人。此人膀大腰圆，留着一把棕色的大胡子。</p> 
<p>“我看在我掌握了更多的情况之前，我将保留我的意见。这个问题需要不断探索，要视结果而定。”</p> 
<p>“萨科尼，你呢？”</p> 
<p>“我倒想听听波拉夫人有些什么话要说。她的建议总是十分宝贵的。”</p> 
<p>大家都转向屋里唯一的女性。她一直坐在沙发上，一只手托着下巴，默默地听着别人的讨论。她那双黑色的眼睛深沉而又严肃，但是当她抬起眼睛时，里面显然流露出颇觉有趣的神情。</p> 
<p>“恐怕我不赞同大家的意见。”她说。</p> 
<p>“你总是这样，最糟糕的是你总是对的。”里卡尔多插了一句。</p> 
<p>“我认为我们的确应该和耶稣会教士展开斗争，如果我们使用这一种武器不行，那么我们就必须使用另一种武器。但是光是对着干则是一件软弱无力的武器，躲避审查又是一件麻烦的武器。至于请愿，那是小孩子的玩具。”</p> 
<p>“夫人，”格拉西尼表情严肃，插嘴说道，“我希望你不是建议采取诸如——诸如暗杀这样的措施吧？”</p> 
<p>马尔蒂尼扯了扯他的大胡子，加利竟然笑出声来。甚至连那位青年女人都忍俊不禁，微微一笑。</p> 
<p>“相信我，”她说，“如果我那么歹毒，竟然想出了这种事情，那么我也不会那么幼稚，竟然侃侃而谈。但是我知道最厉害的武器是冷嘲热讽。如果你们能把耶稣会教士描绘成滑稽可笑的人物，引发人们嘲笑他们，嘲笑他们的主张，那么你们不用流血就已征服了他们。”</p> 
<p>“就此而言，我相信你是对的，”法布里齐说道，“但是我看不出怎样才能做到这一点。”</p> 
<p>“我们为什么就不能做到这一点呢？”马尔蒂尼问道，“一篇讽刺文章比一篇严肃的文章更有机会通过审查。而且如果必须遮遮掩掩，那么比起一篇科学论文或者一篇经济论文来，普通读者也就更有可能从一个看似荒唐的笑话中找出双关的意义。”</p> 
<p>“夫人，你是建议我们应该发行讽刺性的小册子，或者试办一份滑稽小报吗？我敢肯定审查官们永远都不会批准出版一份滑稽小报的。”</p> 
<p>“我并不是说一定要出版小册子或者滑稽小报。我相信可以印发一系列讽刺性的小传单，以诗歌或者散文的形式，廉价地卖出去，或者在街上免费散发。这会很有用的。如果我们能够找到一位聪明的画家，能够领悟这种文章的精神，那么我们就可以加上插图。”</p> 
<p>“如果能够做成这件事，这倒是一个绝妙的主意。但是如果真要去做这件事，那么就必须做好。我们应该找到一位一流的讽刺作家。我们上哪儿才能找到这样的人呢？”</p> 
<p>“瞧瞧，”莱嘉说道，“我们当中大多数人都是严肃作家，尽管我尊重在座的各位，但是要我来说，一哄而上强装幽默，恐怕就像大象想要跳塔伦泰拉舞一样。”</p> 
<p>“我从来没有建议我们都应抢着去做我们并不合适的工作。我的意思是我们应该努力去寻找一个真正具有这种才能的讽刺作家，在意大利的某个地方，我们肯定能够找到这样的人。我们可以给他提供必要的资金。当然我们应该了解这个人的情况，确保他将会按照我们能够取得一致的方针工作。”</p> 
<p>“但是我们上哪儿去找呢？真正具有才能的讽刺作家是屈指可数的，可是这样的人又找不到。裘斯梯是不会接受的，他忙得不可开交。伦巴第倒有一两位好人，但是他们只用米兰方言写作——”</p> 
<p>“此外，”格拉西尼说道，“我们可以采用比这更好的方法影响托斯卡纳人。如果我们把公民自由和宗教自由这样的严肃问题当成小事一桩，我敢肯定别人至少会觉得我们缺乏政治策略才干。佛罗伦萨不像伦敦一样是片蛮荒之地，仅仅知道办工厂赚大钱，也不像巴黎一样是个醉生梦死的场所。它是一个具有光荣历史的城市——”</p> 
<p>“雅典也一样，”她一脸微笑，插嘴说道，“但是它‘因为臃肿而显得相当笨拙，需要一只牛虻把它叮醒’——”</p> 
<p>里卡尔多一拍桌子。“嗨，我们竟然没有想到牛虻！就是他了！”</p> 
<p>“他是谁啊？”</p> 
<p>“牛虻——费利斯·里瓦雷兹。你不记得他了吗？就是穆拉托里队伍中的那一个人，三年前从亚平宁山区下来。”</p> 
<p>“噢，你是认识那帮人的，对吗？我记得他们去巴黎的时候，你是和他们一道走的。”</p> 
<p>“是的。我去了里窝那，是送里瓦雷兹去马赛。他不愿留在托斯卡纳，他说起义失败以后，除了放声大笑没有别的事情可做，所以他最好还是去巴黎。他无疑赞同格拉西尼的意见，认为在托斯卡纳这个地方是笑不出来的。可我几乎可以肯定，如果我们出面请他，他会回来的，因为现在又有机会为意大利做点什么了。”</p> 
<p>“他叫什么名字来着？”</p> 
<p>“里瓦雷兹。我想他是巴西人吧。反正我知道他在那里住过。在我见过的人当中，他算是一个非常机智的人。天晓得我们在里窝那的那个星期没有什么值得高兴的事情，看着可怜的兰姆勃鲁契尼就够让人伤心了。但是每当里瓦雷兹在屋里时，没有人能够忍住不笑。他张口就是笑话，就像是一团经久不熄的火。他脸上还有一处难看的刀伤。我记得是我替他缝合了伤口。他是个奇怪的人，但是我相信就是因为有了他，有他胡说八道，有些可怜的小伙子才没有完全垮下来。”</p> 
<p>“就是那个署名‘牛虻’，并在法语报纸上撰写政论性讽刺短文的人吗？”</p> 
<p>“是的。他写的大多是短小精悍、内容滑稽的小品文。亚平宁山区的私贩子叫他‘牛虻’，因为他那张嘴太厉害了。随后他就把这个绰号当作他的笔名。”</p> 
<p>“我对这位先生有点了解。”格拉西尼插嘴说道。他说起话来一字一板的，神情煞是庄重。“我不能说我所听到的都是赞扬他的话。他无疑具有某种哗众取宠的小聪明，尽管我认为他的能力是被过分夸大了。可能他并不缺乏身体力行的勇气，但是他在巴黎和维也纳的声誉，我相信，远非是白璧无瑕的。他像是一个经历过——呃——许多奇遇的人，而且身世不明。据说杜普雷兹探险队本着慈善之心，在南美洲热带某个地方收留了他，当时他就像是一个野人，简直没个人样。至于他是怎么沦落到了那种地步，我相信他从没作过圆满的解释。说到亚平宁山区的起义，参与那次不幸失败的起义什么人都有，我想这一点也不是什么秘密。我们知道在波洛尼亚被处死的人是地道的罪犯。那些逃脱的人当中，大多数人的品格根本就不值得一提。毫无疑问，参加起义的人当中有些是具备高尚品格的人——”</p> 
<p>“他们当中有些人还是在座几位的好友呢！”里卡尔多打断了他的话，声音里带着怒意。“置身事外，横挑鼻子竖挑眼倒是挺好的，格拉西尼。但是这些‘地道的罪犯’是为了他们的信仰而死的，他们所做的事情比你我所做的事情要多。”</p> 
<p>“下一次要是有人给你讲起巴黎这种平庸的风言风语，”加利补充说道，“你可以告诉他们，就我所知，他们有关杜普雷兹探险队的说法全是错的。我认识杜普雷兹的助手马尔泰尔本人，我从他那里听到了事情的经过。他们的确发现里瓦雷兹流落到了那里。他在争取阿根廷共和国独立的战斗中被俘，并且逃了出去。他扮作各种各样的人，在那个国家四处流浪，试图回到布宜诺斯艾利斯。但是说什么本着慈善之心收留了他，这种道听途说纯粹是杜撰。他们的翻译生了病，只得被送了回去。那些法国人全都不会说当地的语言，所以请他担任翻译。他和他们一起待了三年，考查了亚马逊河的支流。马尔泰尔告诉我，他相信他们如果没有里瓦雷兹，他们就不可能完成那次探险。”</p> 
<p>“不管他是什么人，”法布里齐说道，“他一定具有过人的本领，否则他就不会受到像马尔泰尔和杜普雷兹这两位老练的探险家瞩目，而且看来他确实受到了他们的瞩目。夫人，你有什么看法？”</p> 
<p>“我对这件事一无所知。他们经过托斯卡纳逃走时，我还在英国。但是我倒认为，如果跟他在蛮荒的国度探险三年的同伴和跟他一道起义的同志对他评价很高，这就算是一价很有分量的推荐书，足以抵消许多街上的那种流言蜚语。”</p> 
<p>“至于他的同志对他的看法，那是没有什么好说的。”里卡尔多说道，“从穆拉托里和赞贝卡里到最粗鲁的山民，他们无不对他以诚相见。此外，他和奥尔西尼私交很深。另一方面，有关他在巴黎的情况，确实不断传出不是太好的无稽之谈。但是一个人要是不想树敌太多，那么他就不该成为一个政治讽刺家。”</p> 
<p>“我记得不是很清楚，”莱嘉插嘴说道，“但是那些人经过这里逃走时，我好像记得见过他一次。他是不是驼背，或者腰部弯曲什么的？”</p> 
<p>教授已经拉开了写字台的抽屉，正在翻着一堆材料。“我看我这里放着警察通缉他的告示，”他说。“你们肯定记得在他们逃到山里藏了起来以后，到处都张贴着他们的画像，而且那个红衣主教——那个混蛋叫什么名字来着？——斯宾诺拉，他还悬赏他们的脑袋呢。</p> 
<p>“顺便说一下，关于里瓦雷兹和那张告示，这里还有一个神奇的故事。他穿上当兵的旧军装到处游荡，装扮成在执行任务时受伤的骑兵，试图寻找他的同伴。他竟让斯宾诺拉的搜查队准许他搭乘便车，并在一辆马车上坐了一天。他对他们讲了许多惊心动魄的故事，说他怎么被叛乱分子俘虏，又是怎样被拖进了山中的匪巢，并说自己受尽了折磨。他们把通缉告示拿给他看，于是他就编了一通瞎话，大谈他们称作‘牛虻’的魔鬼。到了晚上，等到他们都睡着了以后，他往他们的火药上浇了一桶水，然后他就溜之大吉，口袋里装满了给养和弹药——”</p> 
<p>“噢，就是这个，”法布里齐插进话来，“‘费利斯·里瓦雷兹，又名牛虻。年龄：大约三十岁。籍贯和出身：不详，可能系南美人。职业：记者。身材矮小。黑发。黑色胡须。皮肤黝黑。眼睛：蓝色。前额：既阔又圆。鼻子，嘴巴，下巴——’对了，这儿：‘特征：右脚跛；左臂弯曲；左手少了两指；脸上有最近被马刀砍伤的疤痕；口吃。’下面还有一句附言：‘精于枪法，捕时要加以注意。’”</p> 
<p>“搜查队掌握这么详尽的特征，他竟然还能骗过他们，真是让人叹为观止。”</p> 
<p>“这当然是凭着一身无畏的勇气，他才化险为夷。如果他们对他产生一丝的怀疑，那他就没命了。但是每当他装出一副无话不说的天真模样时，什么难关他都能闯过。好了，先生们，你们认为这个提议怎么样？看来在座的几位都了解里瓦雷兹。我们是不是向他表示，我们很高兴请他到这里帮忙呢？”</p> 
<p>“在我看来，”法布里齐说道，“我们不妨跟他提提这件事情，看看他是否愿意考虑我们这个计划。”</p> 
<p>“噢，你尽管放心好了，只要是和耶稣会教士斗，他一定愿意参加。在我认识的人当中，他是最反对教士的。事实上他在这一点上态度非常坚决。”</p> 
<p>“里卡尔多，那么我们就写信吧？”</p> 
<p>“那是自然的了。让我想想，现在他在什么地方呢？我想是在瑞士吧。他是哪儿也待不住的人，总是东奔西跑。但是至少小册子的问题——”</p> 
<p>他们随即展开了一场长久而又热烈的讨论。等到与会的人最终散去的时候，马尔蒂尼走到那位沉默寡言的青年妇女跟前。</p> 
<p>“我送你回家吧，琼玛。”</p> 
<p>“谢谢，我想和你谈件事。”</p> 
<p>“地址弄错了吗？”他轻声地问道。</p> 
<p>“并不怎么严重，但是我认为应该作点更正。这个星期有两封信被扣在邮局。信都不怎么重要，也许是事出意外吧。但是我们可不能冒险。如果警察一旦开始怀疑我们任何一个地址，那么赶紧就得更换。”</p> 
<p>“这事我们明天再谈。今晚我不想和你谈正事，你看上去有点累。”</p> 
<p>“我不累的。”</p> 
<p>“那么你又心情不好了。”</p> 
<p>“噢，不是。没有什么特别的事儿。”</p>
