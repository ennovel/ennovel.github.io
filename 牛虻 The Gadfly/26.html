Montanelli stood before the high altar among his ministers and acolytes and read the Introit aloud in steady tones. All the Cathedral was a blaze of light and colour; from the holiday dresses of the congregation to the pillars with their flaming draperies and wreaths of flowers there was no dull spot in it. Over the open spaces of the doorway fell great scarlet curtains, through whose folds the hot June sunlight glowed, as through the petals of red poppies in a corn-field. The religious orders with their candles and torches, the companies of the parishes with their crosses and flags, lighted up the dim side-chapels; and in the aisles the silken folds of the processional banners drooped, their gilded staves and tassels glinting under the arches. The surplices of the choristers gleamed, rainbow-tinted, beneath the coloured windows; the sunlight lay on the chancel floor in chequered stains of orange and purple and green. Behind the altar hung a shimmering veil of silver tissue; and against the veil and the decorations and the altar-lights the Cardinal's figure stood out in its trailing white robes like a marble statue that had come to life.</p> 
<p>As was customary on processional days, he was only to preside at the Mass, not to celebrate, so at the end of the Indulgentiam he turned from the altar and walked slowly to the episcopal throne, celebrant and ministers bowing low as he passed.</p> 
<p>"I'm afraid His Eminence is not well," one of the canons whispered to his neighbour; "he seems so strange."</p> 
<p>Montanelli bent his head to receive the jewelled mitre. The priest who was acting as deacon of honour put it on, looked at him for an instant, then leaned forward and whispered softly:</p> 
<p>"Your Eminence, are you ill?"</p> 
<p>Montanelli turned slightly towards him. There was no recognition in his eyes.</p> 
<p>"Pardon, Your Eminence!" the priest whispered, as he made a genuflexion and went back to his place, reproaching himself for having interrupted the Cardinal's devotions.</p> 
<p>The familiar ceremony went on; and Montanelli sat erect and still, his glittering mitre and gold-brocaded vestments flashing back the sunlight, and the heavy folds of his white festival mantle sweeping down over the red carpet. The light of a hundred candles sparkled among the sapphires on his breast, and shone into the deep, still eyes that had no answering gleam; and when, at the words: "Benedicite, pater eminentissime," he stooped to bless the incense, and the sunbeams played among the diamonds, he might have recalled some splendid and fearful ice-spirit of the mountains, crowned with rainbows and robed in drifted snow, scattering, with extended hands, a shower of blessings or of curses.</p> 
<p>At the elevation of the Host he descended from his throne and knelt before the altar. There was a strange, still evenness about all his movements; and as he rose and went back to his place the major of dragoons, who was sitting in gala uniform behind the Governor, whispered to the wounded captain: "The old Cardinal's breaking, not a doubt of it. He goes through his work like a machine."</p> 
<p>"So much the better!" the captain whispered back. "He's been nothing but a mill-stone round all our necks ever since that confounded amnesty."</p> 
<p>"He did give in, though, about the court-martial."</p> 
<p>"Yes, at last; but he was a precious time making up his mind to. Heavens, how close it is! We shall all get sun-stroke in the procession. It's a pity we're not Cardinals, to have a canopy held over our heads all the way---- Sh-sh-sh! There's my uncle looking at us!"</p> 
<p>Colonel Ferrari had turned round to glance severely at the two younger officers. After the solemn event of yesterday morning he was in a devout and serious frame of mind, and inclined to reproach them with a want of proper feeling about what he regarded as "a painful necessity of state."</p> 
<p>The masters of the ceremonies began to assemble and place in order those who were to take part in the procession. Colonel Ferrari rose from his place and moved up to the chancel-rail, beckoning to the other officers to accompany him. When the Mass was finished, and the Host had been placed behind the crystal shield in the processional sun, the celebrant and his ministers retired to the sacristy to change their vestments, and a little buzz of whispered conversation broke out through the church. Montanelli remained seated on his throne, looking straight before him, immovably. All the sea of human life and motion seemed to surge around and below him, and to die away into stillness about his feet. A censer was brought to him; and he raised his hand with the action of an automaton, and put the incense into the vessel, looking neither to the right nor to the left.</p> 
<p>The clergy had come back from the sacristy, and were waiting in the chancel for him to descend; but he remained utterly motionless. The deacon of honour, bending forward to take off the mitre, whispered again, hesitatingly:</p> 
<p>"Your Eminence!"</p> 
<p>The Cardinal looked round.</p> 
<p>"What did you say?"</p> 
<p>"Are you quite sure the procession will not be too much for you? The sun is very hot."</p> 
<p>"What does the sun matter?"</p> 
<p>Montanelli spoke in a cold, measured voice, and the priest again fancied that he must have given offence.</p> 
<p>"Forgive me, Your Eminence. I thought you seemed unwell."</p> 
<p>Montanelli rose without answering. He paused a moment on the upper step of the throne, and asked in the same measured way:</p> 
<p>"What is that?"</p> 
<p>The long train of his mantle swept down over the steps and lay spread out on the chancel-floor, and he was pointing to a fiery stain on the white satin.</p> 
<p>"It's only the sunlight shining through a coloured window, Your Eminence."</p> 
<p>"The sunlight? Is it so red?"</p> 
<p>He descended the steps, and knelt before the altar, swinging the censer slowly to and fro. As he handed it back, the chequered sunlight fell on his bared head and wide, uplifted eyes, and cast a crimson glow across the white veil that his ministers were folding round him.</p> 
<p>He took from the deacon the sacred golden sun; and stood up, as choir and organ burst into a peal of triumphal melody.</p> 
<p>"Pange, lingua, g)oriosi</p> 
<p>Corporis mysterium,</p> 
<p>Sanguinisque pretiosi</p> 
<p>Quem in mundi pretium,</p> 
<p>Fructus ventris generosi</p> 
<p>Rex effudit gentium."</p> 
<p>The bearers came slowly forward, and raised the silken canopy over his head, while the deacons of honour stepped to their places at his right and left and drew back the long folds of the mantle. As the acolytes stooped to lift his robe from the chancel-floor, the lay fraternities heading the procession started to pace down the nave in stately double file, with lighted candles held to left and right.</p> 
<p>He stood above them, by the altar, motionless under the white canopy, holding the Eucharist aloft with steady hands, and watched them as they passed. Two by two, with candles and banners and torches, with crosses and images and flags, they swept slowly down the chancel steps, along the broad nave between the garlanded pillars, and out under the lifted scarlet curtains into the blazing sunlight of the street; and the sound of their chanting died into a rolling murmur, drowned in the pealing of new and newer voices, as the unending stream flowed on, and yet new footsteps echoed down the nave.</p> 
<p>The companies of the parishes passed, with their white shrouds and veiled faces; then the brothers of the Misericordia, black from head to foot, their eyes faintly gleaming through the holes in their masks. Next came the monks in solemn row: the mendicant friars, with their dusky cowls and bare, brown feet; the white-robed, grave Dominicans. Then followed the lay officials of the district; dragoons and carabineers and the local police-officials; the Governor in gala uniform, with his brother officers beside him. A deacon followed, holding up a great cross between two acolytes with gleaming candles; and as the curtains were lifted high to let them pass out at the doorway, Montanelli caught a momentary glimpse, from where he stood under the canopy, of the sunlit blaze of carpeted street and flag-hung walls and white-robed children scattering roses. Ah, the roses; how red they were!</p> 
<p>On and on the procession paced in order; form succeeding to form and colour to colour. Long white surplices, grave and seemly, gave place to gorgeous vestments and embroidered pluvials. Now passed a tall and slender golden cross, borne high above the lighted candles; now the cathedral canons, stately in their dead white mantles. A chaplain paced down the chancel, with the crozier between two flaring torches; then the acolytes moved forward in step, their censers swinging to the rhythm of the music; the bearers raised the canopy higher, counting their steps: "One, two; one, two!" and Montanelli started upon the Way of the Cross.</p> 
<p>Down the chancel steps and all along the nave he passed; under the gallery where the organ pealed and thundered; under the lifted curtains that were so red--so fearfully red; and out into the glaring street, where the blood-red roses lay and withered, crushed into the red carpet by the passing of many feet. A moment's pause at the door, while the lay officials came forward to replace the canopy-bearers; then the procession moved on again, and he with it, his hands clasping the Eucharistic sun, and the voices of the choristers swelling and dying around him, with the rhythmical swaying of censers and the rolling tramp of feet.</p> 
<p>"Verbum caro, panem verum,</p> 
<p>Verbo carnem efficit;</p> 
<p>Sitque sanguis Christi merum----"</p> 
<p>Always blood and always blood! The carpet stretched before him like a red river; the roses lay like blood splashed on the stones---- Oh, God! Is all Thine earth grown red, and all Thy heaven? Ah, what is it to Thee, Thou mighty God---- Thou, whose very lips are smeared with blood!</p> 
<p>"Tantum ergo Sacramentum,</p> 
<p>Veneremur cernui."</p> 
<p>He looked through the crystal shield at the Eucharist. What was that oozing from the wafer-- dripping down between the points of the golden sun--down on to his white robe? What had he seen dripping down--dripping from a lifted hand?</p> 
<p>The grass in the courtyard was trampled and red,--all red,--there was so much blood. It was trickling down the cheek, and dripping from the pierced right hand, and gushing in a hot red torrent from the wounded side. Even a lock of the hair was dabbled in it,--the hair that lay all wet and matted on the forehead--ah, that was the death-sweat; it came from the horrible pain.</p> 
<p>The voices of the choristers rose higher, triumphantly:</p> 
<p>"Genitori, genitoque,</p> 
<p>Laus et jubilatio,</p> 
<p>Salus, honor, virtus quoque,</p> 
<p>Sit et benedictio."</p> 
<p>Oh, that is more than any patience can endure! God, Who sittest on the brazen heavens enthroned, and smilest with bloody lips, looking down upon agony and death, is it not enough? Is it not enough, without this mockery of praise and blessing? Body of Christ, Thou that wast broken for the salvation of men; blood of Christ, Thou that wast shed for the remission of sins; is it not enough?</p> 
<p>"Ah, call Him louder; perchance He sleepeth!</p> 
<p>Dost Thou sleep indeed, dear love; and wilt Thou never wake again? Is the grave so jealous of its victory; and will the black pit under the tree not loose Thee even for a little, heart's delight?</p> 
<p>Then the Thing behind the crystal shield made answer, and the blood dripped down as It spoke:</p> 
<p>"Hast thou chosen, and wilt repent of thy choice? Is thy desire not fulfilled? Look upon these men that walk in the light and are clad in silk and in gold: for their sake was I laid in the black pit. Look upon the children scattering roses, and hearken to their singing if it be sweet: for their sake is my mouth filled with dust, and the roses are red from the well-springs of my heart. See where the people kneel to drink the blood that drips from thy garment-hem: for their sake was it shed, to quench their ravening thirst. For it is written: 'Greater love hath no man than this, if a man lay down his life for his friends.'"</p> 
<p>"Oh, Arthur, Arthur; there is greater love than this! If a man lay down the life of his best beloved, is not that greater?"</p> 
<p>And It answered again:</p> 
<p>"Who is thy best beloved? In sooth, not I."</p> 
<p>And when he would have spoken the words froze on his tongue, for the singing of the choristers passed over them, as the north wind over icy pools, and hushed them into silence:</p> 
<p>"Dedit fragilibus corporis ferculum,</p> 
<p>Dedit et tristibus sanguinis poculum,</p> 
<p>Dicens: Accipite, quod trado vasculum</p> 
<p>Omnes ex eo bibite."</p> 
<p>Drink of it, Christians; drink of it, all of you! Is it not yours? For you the red stream stains the grass; for you the living flesh is seared and torn. Eat of it, cannibals; eat of it, all of you! This is your feast and your orgy; this is the day of your joy! Haste you and come to the festival; join the procession and march with us; women and children, young men and old men--come to the sharing of flesh! Come to the pouring of blood-wine and drink of it while it is red; take and eat of the Body----</p> 
<p>Ah, God; the fortress! Sullen and brown, with crumbling battlements and towers dark among the barren hills, it scowled on the procession sweeping past in the dusty road below. The iron teeth of the portcullis were drawn down over the mouth of the gate; and as a beast crouched on the mountain-side, the fortress guarded its prey. Yet, be the teeth clenched never so fast, they shall be broken and riven asunder; and the grave in the courtyard within shall yield up her dead. For the Christian hosts are marching, marching in mighty procession to their sacramental feast of blood, as marches an army of famished rats to the gleaning; and their cry is: "Give! Give!" and they say not: "It is enough."</p> 
<p>"Wilt thou not be satisfied? For these men was I sacrificed; thou hast destroyed me that they might live; and behold, they march everyone on his ways, and they shall not break their ranks.</p> 
<p>"This is the army of Christians, the followers of thy God; a great people and a strong. A fire devoureth before them, and behind them a flame burneth; the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them."</p> 
<p>"Oh, yet come back, come back to me, beloved; for I repent me of my choice! Come back, and we will creep away together, to some dark and silent grave where the devouring army shall not find us; and we will lay us down there, locked in one another's arms, and sleep, and sleep, and sleep. And the hungry Christians shall pass by in the merciless daylight above our heads; and when they howl for blood to drink and for flesh to eat, their cry shall be faint in our ears; and they shall pass on their ways and leave us to our rest."</p> 
<p>And It answered yet again:</p> 
<p>"Where shall I hide me? Is it not written: 'They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall; they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief?' If I build me a tomb on the mountain-top, shall they not break it open? If I dig me a grave in the river-bed, shall they not tear it up? Verily, they are keen as blood-hounds to seek out their prey; and for them are my wounds red, that they may drink. Canst thou not hear them, what they sing?"</p> 
<p>And they sang, as they went in between the scarlet curtains of the Cathedral door; for the procession was over, and all the roses were strewn:</p> 
<p>"Ave, verum Corpus, natum</p> 
<p>De Maria Virgine:</p> 
<p>Vere passum, immolatum</p> 
<p>In cruce pro homine!</p> 
<p>Cujus latus perforatum</p> 
<p>Undam fluxit cum sanguinae;</p> 
<p>Esto nobis praegustatum</p> 
<p>Mortis in examinae."</p> 
<p>And when they had left off singing, he entered at the doorway, and passed between the silent rows of monks and priests, where they knelt, each man in his place, with the lighted candles uplifted. And he saw their hungry eyes fixed on the sacred Body that he bore; and he knew why they bowed their heads as he passed. For the dark stream ran down the folds of his white vestments; and on the stones of the Cathedral floor his footsteps left a deep, red stain.</p> 
<p>So he passed up the nave to the chancel rails; and there the bearers paused, and he went out from under the canopy and up to the altar steps. To left and right the white-robed acolytes knelt with their censers and the chaplains with their torches; and their eyes shone greedily in the flaring light as they watched the Body of the Victim.</p> 
<p>And as he stood before the altar, holding aloft with blood-stained hands the torn and mangled body of his murdered love, the voices of the guests bidden to the Eucharistic feast rang out in another peal of song:</p> 
<p>"Oh salutaris Hostia,</p> 
<p>Quae coeli pandis ostium;</p> 
<p>Bella praemunt hostilia,</p> 
<p>Da robur, fer, auxilium!"</p> 
<p>Ah, and now they come to take the Body---- Go then, dear heart, to thy bitter doom, and open the gates of heaven for these ravening wolves that will not be denied. The gates that are opened for me are the gates of the nethermost hell.</p> 
<p>And as the deacon of honour placed the sacred vessel on the altar, Montanelli sank down where he had stood, and knelt upon the step; and from the white altar above him the blood flowed down and dripped upon his head. And the voices of the singers rang on, pealing under the arches and echoing along the vaulted roof:</p> 
<p>"Uni trinoque Domino</p> 
<p>Sit sempiterna gloria:</p> 
<p>Qui vitam sine termino</p> 
<p>Nobis donet in patria."</p> 
<p>"Sine termino--sine termino!" Oh, happy Jesus, Who could sink beneath His cross! Oh, happy Jesus, Who could say: "It is finished!" This doom is never ended; it is eternal as the stars in their courses. This is the worm that dieth not and the fire that is not quenched. "Sine termino, sine termino!"</p> 
<p>Wearily, patiently, he went through his part in the remaining ceremonies, fulfilling mechanically, from old habit, the rites that had no longer any meaning for him. Then, after the benediction, he knelt down again before the altar and covered his face; and the voice of the priest reading aloud the list of indulgences swelled and sank like a far-off murmur from a world to which he belonged no more.</p> 
<p>The voice broke off, and he stood up and stretched out his hand for silence. Some of the congregation were moving towards the doors; and they turned back with a hurried rustle and murmur, as a whisper went through the Cathedral:</p> 
<p>"His Eminence is going to speak."</p> 
<p>His ministers, startled and wondering, drew closer to him and one of them whispered hastily: "Your Eminence, do you intend to speak to the people now?"</p> 
<p>Montanelli silently waved him aside. The priests drew back, whispering together; the thing was unusual, even irregular; but it was within the Cardinal's prerogative if he chose to do it. No doubt, he had some statement of exceptional importance to make; some new reform from Rome to announce or a special communication from the Holy Father.</p> 
<p>Montanelli looked down from the altar-steps upon the sea of upturned faces. Full of eager expectancy they looked up at him as he stood above them, spectral and still and white.</p> 
<p>"Sh-sh! Silence!" the leaders of the procession called softly; and the murmuring of the congregation died into stillness, as a gust of wind dies among whispering tree-tops. All the crowd gazed up, in breathless silence, at the white figure on the altar-steps. Slowly and steadily he began to speak:</p> 
<p>"It is written in the Gospel according to St. John: 'God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son that the world through Him might be saved.'</p> 
<p>"This is the festival of the Body and Blood of the Victim who was slain for your salvation; the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world; the Son of God, Who died for your transgressions. And you are assembled here in solemn festival array, to eat of the sacrifice that was given for you, and to render thanks for this great mercy. And I know that this morning, when you came to share in the banquet, to eat of the Body of the Victim, your hearts were filled with joy, as you remembered the Passion of God the Son, Who died, that you might be saved.</p> 
<p>"But tell me, which among you has thought of that other Passion--of the Passion of God the Father, Who gave His Son to be crucified? Which of you has remembered the agony of God the Father, when He bent from His throne in the heavens above, and looked down upon Calvary?</p> 
<p>"I have watched you to-day, my people, as you walked in your ranks in solemn procession; and I have seen that your hearts are glad within you for the remission of your sins, and that you rejoice in your salvation. Yet I pray you that you consider at what price that salvation was bought. Surely it is very precious, and the price of it is above rubies; it is the price of blood."</p> 
<p>A faint, long shudder passed through the listening crowd. In the chancel the priests bent forward and whispered to one another; but the preacher went on speaking, and they held their peace.</p> 
<p>"Therefore it is that I speak with you this day: I AM THAT I AM. For I looked upon your weakness and your sorrow, and upon the little children about your feet; and my heart was moved to compassion for their sake, that they must die. Then I looked into my dear son's eyes; and I knew that the Atonement of Blood was there. And I went my way, and left him to his doom.</p> 
<p>"This is the remission of sins. He died for you, and the darkness has swallowed him up; he is dead, and there is no resurrection; he is dead, and I have no son. Oh, my boy, my boy!"</p> 
<p>The Cardinal's voice broke in a long, wailing cry; and the voices of the terrified people answered it like an echo. All the clergy had risen from their places, and the deacons of honour started forward to lay their hands on the preacher's arm. But he wrenched it away, and faced them suddenly, with the eyes of an angry wild beast.</p> 
<p>"What is this? Is there not blood enough? Wait your turn, jackals; you shall all be fed!"</p> 
<p>They shrank away and huddled shivering together, their panting breath thick and loud, their faces white with the whiteness of chalk. Montanelli turned again to the people, and they swayed and shook before him, as a field of corn before a hurricane.</p> 
<p>"You have killed him! You have killed him! And I suffered it, because I would not let you die. And now, when you come about me with your lying praises and your unclean prayers, I repent me--I repent me that I have done this thing! It were better that you all should rot in your vices, in the bottomless filth of damnation, and that he should live. What is the worth of your plague-spotted souls, that such a price should be paid for them? But it is too late--too late! I cry aloud, but he does not hear me; I beat at the door of the grave, but he will not wake; I stand alone, in desert space, and look around me, from the blood-stained earth where the heart of my heart lies buried, to the void and awful heaven that is left unto me, desolate. I have given him up; oh, generation of vipers, I have given him up for you!</p> 
<p>"Take your salvation, since it is yours! I fling it to you as a bone is flung to a pack of snarling curs! The price of your banquet is paid for you; come, then, and gorge yourselves, cannibals, bloodsuckers--carrion beasts that feed on the dead! See where the blood streams down from the altar, foaming and hot from my darling's heart--the blood that was shed for you! Wallow and lap it and smear yourselves red with it! Snatch and fight for the flesh and devour it--and trouble me no more! This is the body that was given for you--look at it, torn and bleeding, throbbing still with the tortured life, quivering from the bitter death-agony; take it, Christians, and eat!"</p> 
<p>He had caught up the sun with the Host and lifted it above his head; and now flung it crashing down upon the floor. At the ring of the metal on stone the clergy rushed forward together, and twenty hands seized the madman.</p> 
<p>Then, and only then, the silence of the people broke in a wild, hysterical scream; and, overturning chairs and benches, beating at the doorways, trampling one upon another, tearing down curtains and garlands in their haste, the surging, sobbing human flood poured out upon the street.</p> 
<p>“IntroiboadaltareDei．”［拉丁语：让我伏在上帝的神座之前。］蒙泰尼里站在高大的祭坛上朗诵赞美诗，语调平稳。四周都是他手下的教士和侍祭。</p> 
<p>整个大教堂装饰得金碧辉煌。从汇聚一起的人们所穿的节日盛装，到悬挂火红的帷幕和花圈的柱子，没有一处黯然无光。</p> 
<p>敞开的入口挂上了鲜红的门帘，炎热的六月阳光通过门帘的褶皱发出耀眼的光芒，就像阳光映过麦田里的红色罂粟花瓣。</p> 
<p>各修道会的会友举着蜡烛和火炬，各教区的教友举着十字架和旗帜，照亮了两侧的小祭坛；游行旗帜的丝绸褶皱在过道里垂挂下来，镀金的旗杆和流苏在拱门之下闪闪发光。在彩色玻璃窗户下，唱诗班教士的白色法衣呈现出缤纷的色彩；阳光照到内殿的地板上，闪耀着橘红色、紫色和绿色的方形光斑。祭坛后面挂着一道闪亮的银色织锦；红衣主教穿着拖曳的白色长袍，他的身影衬着帷幕以及饰物和祭坛的灯光，站在那里就像一尊被赋予生命的大理石雕像。</p> 
<p>按照节日游行的惯例，他只负责主持弥撒，并不参加庆祝活动，所以恕罪祷告结束以后，他离开了祭坛，缓步走向主教的宝座。在他经过时，教士和教友向他深深鞠躬。</p> 
<p>“恐怕主教阁下不大舒服，”一位神父对身旁的同伴低声说道，“他的神情有些异样。”</p> 
<p>蒙泰尼里垂下脑袋，接受镶嵌宝石的主教冠。担任副主祭的教士给他戴上主教冠，看了他一会儿，然后凑身向前轻声耳语：“主教阁下，您病了吗？”</p> 
<p>蒙泰尼里略微转过身来。他的眼神没有作出反应。</p> 
<p>“请您原谅，主教阁下！”那位教士低声说道，并且行了一个屈膝礼，然后走回自己的位置。他责备自己扰乱了红衣主教的祈祷。</p> 
<p>熟悉的仪式继续进行，蒙泰尼里直挺挺地坐在那里，纹丝不动。闪亮的主教冠和金丝锦缎法衣反射出绚丽的阳光，白色节日长袍的沉重褶皱拖在红色的地毯上。百十支蜡烛的光亮照到他胸前的蓝宝石上，并且照到深邃而又平静的眼睛里，可是他的眼里却没有反光。听到“Benedicite，patereminentissime”［拉丁语：请赐福吧，主教阁下。］时，他才向香炉弯腰祝福。阳光辉映宝石，他也许想起山中壮丽而又可怕的冰雪精灵，头顶彩虹，身披飞雪，伸出双手播撒祝福或者诅咒。</p> 
<p>奉献圣饼时，他走下宝座，跪在了祭坛前。他的一举一动含有一种怪异而又平静的呆板。他随后起身回到了他的座位上。身穿节日制服的骑巡队少校坐在总督的后面，这时他低声对负伤的上尉说道：“老红衣主教无疑是心力交瘁。他的举动就像机器一样。”</p> 
<p>“活该！”上尉低声回答。“自从颁布了那道该死的大赦令，他就一直和我们过不去。”</p> 
<p>“可他还是作了让步，同意设立军事法庭。”</p> 
<p>“是，总算同意了。但是他磨了很长时间才作出了决定。</p> 
<p>天啊，天气真闷！游行时我们都会中暑的。可惜我们不是红衣主教，一路上有华盖罩在头上——嘘——嘘——嘘！我叔叔正看着我们呢！”</p> 
<p>费拉里上校转过身来狠狠地瞪着两位年轻的军官。经过昨天清晨那件庄重的事情，他处于一种虔诚、严肃的状态，想要斥责他们对他所谓的“国家之痛苦需要”缺乏正确的认识。</p> 
<p>司仪开始指挥将要参加游行的人们排成队伍。费拉里上校起身离开了自己的座位，然后走到内殿栏杆的前面，并且招呼其他的军官跟随在他的身后。弥撒结束以后，圣饼安放在圣体龛子的水晶罩子里面，主持仪式的那位教士和手下的教士退进法衣室里更衣。这时教堂里响起了一阵窃窃私语声。</p> 
<p>蒙泰尼里仍然坐在那里，直愣愣地看着前方，一动也不动。人世的喧嚣海洋仿佛在他的身下四周涌起，并在他的脚下渐渐平息下来。有人把一只香炉捧到他的面前，他机械地抬起了手，把香插进香炉里，眼睛没有旁视左右。</p> 
<p>教士们从法衣室里走了回来，站在内殿里等他下来。但是他仍旧一动也不动。副主祭上前弯腰为他取下主教冠，迟疑地低声对他说道：“主教阁下！”</p> 
<p>红衣主教转过头来。</p> 
<p>“你说什么？”</p> 
<p>“您真的认为游行不会累着您吗？外面可是骄阳似火！”</p> 
<p>“骄阳又有什么关系？”</p> 
<p>蒙泰尼里说道，声音冷漠而有分寸。教士再次以为冒犯了他。</p> 
<p>“请您原谅，主教阁下。我还以为您的身体好像不大舒服。”</p> 
<p>蒙泰尼里站了起来，没有答话。他在宝座的最高台阶停下了脚步，带着同样颇有分寸的声音问道：“那是什么？”</p> 
<p>他那法衣的裙裾拖下台阶，摊在内殿的地板上。他指着白色锦缎上一片火红的色斑。</p> 
<p>“只是透过彩色玻璃窗户映射的阳光，主教阁下。”</p> 
<p>“阳光？那么红吗？”</p> 
<p>他走下台阶，跪在祭坛前，慢慢地来回晃动香炉。当他把香炉递回去时，方格形状的阳光照到他的头顶和仰起的那双睁大的眼睛，并往白色的法衣上投下鲜红的光芒。手下的教士正在他的周围叠起那件法衣。</p> 
<p>他从副主祭手里接过镀金的圣体龛子，然后站了起来。这时唱诗班和风琴爆发出了得意洋洋的旋律。</p> 
<p>Pange，lingua，gloriosiCorporismysterium，Sanguinisquepretiosi Queminmundi-pretium，FructusventrisgenerosiRexeffuditgentium．［拉丁语：赞美光辉灿烂的圣体，基督的宝贵鲜血慷慨地洒向宝贵的世间，这是基督的恩典。］仪仗人员缓步走上前来，在他的头上举起了丝绸华盖。这时副主祭站在他的左右，把长袍往后拉直。当侍祭弯腰从内殿的地板上托起他的法衣时，站在游行队伍前面的世俗会友庄严地排成了两排，举起了点亮的蜡烛，从中殿两旁向前走去。</p> 
<p>他站在他们上方，靠近祭坛，在华盖下一动也不动。他稳稳地高举起圣体龛子，望着他们鱼贯走过。他们成双成对，举着十字架、神像和旗帜，走下内殿的台阶，沿着挂满花圈的宽阔中殿迈步走去，经过掀起的大红门帘，然后走进烈日之下的街道。他们的歌声逐渐消失，变成了嗡嗡的嘈杂声，并被随即而来的人声淹没。绵延不绝的人流向前涌过，脚步声在中殿里不断地响起。</p> 
<p>各个教区的教友身穿长袍、罩着面纱从此经过；随后是从头到脚一袭黑衣的悲信会教士，他们的眼睛透过面罩的小孔发出黯淡的光芒；接着前来的是庄严肃穆的修道士，既有身披暗黑色长袍、赤着褐色脚板的托钵修道士，也有身披白色长袍、神情庄重的多明我会修道士。后面跟着这个地区的世俗官员；然后是骑巡队、马枪队和当地的警官；然后是身穿礼服的总督，以及身旁的同僚。一位助祭跟在后面，他举着一根巨大的十字架，左右两名侍祭捧着闪闪发光的蜡烛。门帘揭得更高，便于他们走出门口。这时蒙泰尼里站在华盖下面，透过门帘瞥了一眼铺着地毯的街道和悬挂旗帜的墙壁。身穿白袍的孩子撒着玫瑰花。啊，玫瑰花儿。多红的玫瑰花啊！</p> 
<p>游行的队伍依次前进。一个方队接着一个方队，一种颜色接着一种颜色。忽而是宽大的白色法衣，庄重而又得体；忽而是华丽的祭服和绣花的长袍。现在经过一根高大而细长的镀金十字架，举在点燃的蜡烛之上；现在走过表情庄重的大教堂神父，全都穿着白色的长袍。一位牧师踱下内殿，在两把火炬之间擎着主教十字杖；侍祭随即迈步上前，手中的香炉随着乐曲的节奏而摇动；仪仗人员把华盖举得更高，并且数着他们的步子：“一，二；一，二！”蒙泰尼里踏上了十字架之路。</p> 
<p>他走下内殿台阶，经过了中殿，穿过了风琴雷动的游廊，穿过了掀起的红色门帘——红得怕人，然后走到了灼热的街道上。撒落在街上的鲜红色的玫瑰已经枯萎，并被众人踩进红色的地毯里。他在门口停顿了片刻，这时几位世俗的官员前来接替撑着华盖的仪仗人员。随后游行的队伍继续前进，他捧着圣体龛子走在队伍之中。周围的唱诗班歌声抑扬顿挫，香炉的摇动和橐橐的步伐合着节拍。</p> 
<p>Verbumcaro，panemverum，Verbocarnemefficit；Sitquesanguis，Christimerum——［拉丁语：主使基督的身体变成了饼，主使基督的鲜血变成了酒……］总是鲜血，总是鲜血！展现在面前的地毯就像一条红色的血河；玫瑰就像溅落在石头上的鲜血——噢，上帝！难道你的天地全都变红了吗？啊，这对你来说是什么，万能的上帝——你，你的嘴唇涂上了鲜血吗？</p> 
<p>TantumergoSacramentum，Veneremurcernui．［拉丁语：让我们深深鞠躬让我们膜拜伟大的圣餐。］他望着水晶罩子里的圣饼。圣饼渗出——并从镀金的圣体龛子四角滴下——滴到他的白色法衣上的是什么？他看到滴下——从他手中滴下的是什么？</p> 
<p>院子的茅草被人踩成了红色——全是红色——那么多的鲜血。从面颊流下，从钉穿的手上流下，从受伤的胁部涌出热血。甚至连一束头发也沾上了鲜血——湿漉漉的头发贴在前额——啊，这是死亡的汗水，它来自可怕的痛苦。</p> 
<p>唱诗班的歌声更加高亢，那么得意洋洋：Genitori，genitoque，Lausetjubilatio，Salus，honor，virtusquoque，Sitetbenedictio．［拉丁语：赞美圣父和圣子，赞美主拯救人类，赞美主的光荣与权威，赞美主的恩惠。］噢，再也无法忍受了！上帝坐在天堂的黄铜宝座上，鲜红的嘴唇露出微笑。他在俯看痛苦和死亡。这还不够吗？没有拙劣的赞美和祝福，难道就不够吗？基督的肉体，你为了拯救人类粉身碎骨；基督的鲜血，你为了替人类赎罪而流尽。</p> 
<p>这还不够吗？</p> 
<p>啊，对他喊得响点，也许他睡熟了！</p> 
<p>亲爱的儿子，难道你真睡熟了？难道你再也不会醒来？坟墓如此妒忌它的胜利吗？心爱的儿子，那个黑色的水坑连一会儿都不放过你吗？</p> 
<p>水晶罩子里面的那个东西作了回答，滴下的鲜血说道：</p> 
<p>“你不是作出了选择，并将忏悔你的选择吗？你的心愿不是得到满足了吗？看看那些裹着丝绸、穿金戴银的人们，他们走在光明之中；为了他们，我被抛进那个黑色的土坑。看看撒落玫瑰的孩子，听听他们的歌声是否甜蜜；为了他们，我的嘴巴塞满了尘土，那些玫瑰是被我心中流出的鲜血染红。看看人们在怎么跪下身来，他们要去喝从衣角滴下的鲜血；为了他们，我才会流血，以便遏制他们贪得无厌的饥渴。因为《圣经》上写道：‘倘使有人为了朋友而献身，这种爱是最伟大的。’”</p> 
<p>“噢，亚瑟，亚瑟。没有比这更伟大的爱了！倘使有人牺牲了他最亲爱的人，这还不伟大吗？”</p> 
<p>它又答道：“谁是你最亲爱的人？其实不是我。”</p> 
<p>当他准备说话时，那些话冻结在他的舌头上。因为唱诗班的歌声已经绕过了他们，就像北风吹过结冰的池塘，并使他们缄默不语。</p> 
<p>Deditfragilibuscorporisferculum，Deditettristibussanguinispoculum，DicensAccipete，quodtradovasculumOmenesexeobibite．［拉丁语：我们向伟大的躯体顶礼，我们向光荣的鲜血奉祭，把它们吃下去，喝下去，我们幸福无比。］喝下它，基督徒们；喝下它，你们全都喝下！这不是你们的吗？因为你们，鲜血染红了茅草；因为你们，活人的肉体枯朽，并被撕碎。吃下它吧，食肉的野人；吃下它，你们全都吃下！这是你们的盛宴，你们的狂欢；这是你们喜庆的日子！快点过来参加节日；加入游行的队伍，和我们一起前进；女人和孩子，青年和老人——过来分享一份肉吧！</p> 
<p>它又答道：“我把我藏在什么地方？《圣经》上不是写着：‘他们将会在城里来回跑；他们将会撞到墙上；他们将会爬上房屋；他们将会像小偷一样从窗户进去？’如果我在山顶为我修建一个坟墓，他们不会把它打开吗？如果我在河床挖掘一个坟墓，他们不会捣毁吗？核实一下，他们就像猎狗一样精于追寻他们的猎物。因为他们，我的伤口流血，这样他们才可以喝血。你听不出他们唱些什么吗？”</p> 
<p>Ave，verumCorpus，natum，DeMariaVirgine：Verepassum，immolatumIncruceprohomine！</p> 
<p>CujuslatusperforatumUndamfluxitcumsanguine；EstonobisproegustatumMortisinexamine．［拉丁语：膜拜圣体吧，那是圣母玛利亚之子，为了拯救人类，他被钉在十字架上，钉子刺穿了他的躯体，任凭鲜血流淌。］当他们停止了歌唱时，他走到了门口，经过成排的沉默的修道士和教士。他们跪在各自的位置上，举着点燃的蜡烛。</p> 
<p>他看见他们饥饿的眼睛盯着自己所捧的圣体，他们知道他们为什么在他经过时低下脑袋。因为暗黑的血从他的白袍褶皱流了下来，他的脚步在大教堂的地板上留下了一块深深的红色血迹。</p> 
<p>他经过中殿走到内殿栏杆前。仪仗人员在那里停下脚步，他从华盖下走了出来，登上了祭坛台阶。左右的侍祭捧着香炉跪了下来，教士举着火炬跪了下来。当他们望着圣体，他们的眼睛在炽亮的火光中发出贪婪的目光。</p> 
<p>他那沾满鲜血的双手高举已被谋杀的爱子残缺的身体，走到了祭坛前面。这时预备分享圣体的人们又唱起了歌声：OhsalutarisHostia，Quoecoelipandisostium；Bellapremunthostillia，Darobur，fer，auxilium！［拉丁语：啊，神圣的主！崇高的牺牲者，我们心之慰抚，我们永世的安乐。］啊，现在他们就要过来领取圣体——去吧，心爱的儿子，走向痛苦的末日，打开天堂的大门，放进那些无法赶走的俄狼。地狱底层的大门已经为我敞开。</p> 
<p>副主祭把装有圣体的器皿放在祭坛上，这时蒙泰尼里伏下身体，跪在祭坛的台阶上。鲜血从上方的白色祭坛流了下来，滴在他的头上。唱诗班的歌声响了起来，回荡在拱门和穹顶之间：UnitrinoquedominoSitsempiternagloria：QuivitamsineterminoNobisdonetinpatria．［拉丁语：三位一体的圣灵，他使我们世代相传，他的光荣永世长存，永无终止。］“Sinetermino，sinetermino！”［拉丁语：永无终止。］噢，幸福的耶稣，他可以倒在他的十字架下！噢，幸福的耶稣，他可以说：“一切都结束了！”末日审判从来没有结束；它就像运行于宇宙的星星一样永恒。它是不会死去的蚯蚓，它是无法扑灭的火焰。</p> 
<p>“Sinetermino，sinetermino！”</p> 
<p>虽然疲倦，但在仪式的剩余时间里，他却耐心地行使他的职责，在旧的习惯支配下完成那些对他来说早已没有意义的礼节。随后，在祝福完了以后，他在祭坛前跪了下来，捂住了他的脸。一位教士正在宣读免罪表，他的声音抑扬顿挫，最后变成了喃喃的低语，像是来自他已不再属于的那个世界。</p> 
<p>那个声音停止了，他站了起来，伸出手示意肃静。有些人正在走向出口，见此随即转身回来。这时大教堂里响起了一片窃窃私语声：“主教阁下有话要讲。”</p> 
<p>手下的教士颇觉意外，他们凑到他的跟前，其中一人急忙小声问道：“主教阁下，您现在想跟大家讲话吗？”</p> 
<p>蒙泰尼里没有做声，挥手把他们打发到了一边。教士退了下去，交头接耳地议论起来。这事异乎寻常，甚至不合规则，但是红衣主教有权这样做。无疑他要发表意义特别重大的声明，宣布罗马颁发新的改革法令，或者宣读圣父的特别圣谕。</p> 
<p>蒙泰尼里从祭坛的台阶上俯看抬头仰望的众人。他们望着他，充满了急切的期望。他站在他们的上方，幽灵一般，平静而又苍白。</p> 
<p>“嘘——嘘！肃静！”游行队伍的领队轻声叫道，众人的窃窃低语声平息下来，就像一阵狂风消失在哗哗作响的树梢。</p> 
<p>他一字一顿，开口说道：“《约翰福音》写道：‘神爱世人，甚至将他的独生子赐给他们，叫一切信他的，不致灭亡，反得永生。’“这是圣体和圣血的节日，受难者为了拯救你们而被杀戮。上帝的羔羊涤除了世间的罪恶，圣子为了你们的罪孽而死。你们聚集在这里，参加这个庄严的节日，吃下分给你们的牺牲，并且感激这样伟大的恩惠。我知道今天早晨，当你们前来参加这次盛宴，准备吃下受难者的圣体时，你们的内心充满了喜悦，因为你们想起了圣子受难，圣子为了拯救你们而死。</p> 
<p>“但是告诉我，你们当中有谁想过他人的受难——圣父的受难？他献出了他的儿子，使他钉死在十字架上。你们当中有谁想起过在他走下神座，俯看加尔佛莱的时候，圣父的痛苦呢？</p> 
<p>“今天，在你们排着庄严的队伍经过时，我观察过你们。我看见过你们的内心充满了喜悦，因为你们的罪孽已经赦免，你们庆贺自己得到了拯救。可是我请求你们考虑一下拯救的代价。代价当然很大，代价比红宝石还高。这是血的代价。”</p> 
<p>聆听讲话的人群引发了一阵轻微而又持久的颤动。内殿里的教士躬身向前，交头接耳。但是红衣主教继续往下说，他们遂又安静下来。</p> 
<p>“因此今天是我在跟你们讲话：我就是我。因为我照顾你们的懦弱和凄苦，照顾你们膝下的孩子。眼看他们必须死去，我的心不禁怜悯他们。随后我又望着我那亲爱的儿子的眼睛，我知道赎罪的血就在那里。我竟自走去，留下他惨遭灭顶之灾。</p> 
<p>“这就是赎罪，他为你们而死，黑暗已经吞噬了他。他死了，我没有儿子了。噢，我的孩子，我的孩子！”</p> 
<p>红衣主教的声音变成了嚎啕大哭，惊愕的人们纷纷议论开来。所有的教士都从他们所在的地方站了起来，副主祭上前把他的双手放到红衣主教的肩上。但是他挣脱开来，突然面对他们，双眼冒火，就像一只发怒的野兽。</p> 
<p>“干什么？血还不够吗？等着吧，还没轮到你们，你们这些豺狼。你们全都会被喂饱的！”</p> 
<p>他们退了下去，缩在一起发抖。他们喘着粗气，脸色就像粉笔一样白。蒙泰尼里又转过身去。他们在他的前面摇晃颤抖，就像遭到飓风袭击的麦田。</p> 
<p>“你们已经杀死了他！你们已经杀死了他！我却受着煎熬，因为我不愿让你们死去。现在，当你们来到我的面前，带着虚假的赞美和不洁的祈祷，我后悔不已——我后悔我竟做下了这样的事情！你们全都应该在你们的罪恶之中腐烂，在地狱无底的垃圾之中腐烂，而他应该活下来。你们的龋龊心灵又有什么价值，竟然应当付出这样的代价？但是太晚了——太晚了！我大声疾呼，但是他听不到我的声音；我敲打坟墓的门，但是他不会醒来了；我独自站在空旷的沙漠里，环视我的周围。我那亲亲宝贝埋在那片血迹斑斑的土地，而我孑然一身，置于空虚可怖的天空。我放弃了他。你们这些毒蛇的子孙，我为了你们放弃了他！</p> 
<p>“拿走圣体吧，因为这是你们的！我把它扔给你们，就像把一根骨头扔给一群狂吠的恶狗！你们这次宴会的代价已经付给了你们。那么就来吧，狼吞虎咽般开怀大吃，你们这些食人的野人和吸血鬼——专吃腐肉的野兽！看看从我的宝贝心中淌出的热血流下了祭坛——这是为了你们而流的血啊！喝下它，把你们的嘴抹得通红！争抢圣体，大口吃吧——不要再麻烦我了！这是奉献给你们的遗体——看看它吧，它已被撕得七零八碎，鲜血淋漓，仍然带着受过酷刑的生命在跳动，并且由于濒死的剧痛而颤抖不已。把它拿过去，基督徒们，吃吧！”</p> 
<p>他抓起装有圣体的龛子，把它举过他的头顶，然后把它摔到地上。就在金属镶边碰到石头上时，教士们冲上前去，二十只手缚住了这个疯子。</p> 
<p>就在这个时候，人们打破了沉寂，发出疯狂的歇斯底里的叫喊。他们推翻了椅子和长凳，冲向门口，相互践踏，忙乱之中撕下了门帘和花圈。骚动的人流涌出了街道。</p>
