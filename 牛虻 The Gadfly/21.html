<p>The Governor tried to preserve the respectful tone due to a high dignitary of the Church; but there was audible irritation in his voice. His liver was out of order, his wife was running up heavy bills, and his temper had been sorely tried during the last three weeks. A sullen, disaffected populace, whose dangerous mood grew daily more apparent; a district honeycombed with plots and bristling with hidden weapons; an inefficient garrison, of whose loyalty he was more than doubtful, and a Cardinal whom he had pathetically described to his adjutant as the "incarnation of immaculate pig-headedness," had already reduced him to the verge of desperation. Now he was saddled with the Gadfly, an animated quintessence of the spirit of mischief.</p> 
<p>Having begun by disabling both the Governor's favourite nephew and his most valuable spy, the "crooked Spanish devil" had followed up his exploits in the market-place by suborning the guards, browbeating the interrogating officers, and "turning the prison into a bear-garden." He had now been three weeks in the fortress, and the authorities of Brisighella were heartily sick of their bargain. They had subjected him to interrogation upon interrogation; and after employing, to obtain admissions from him, every device of threat, persuasion, and stratagem which their ingenuity could suggest, remained just as wise as on the day of his capture. They had begun to realize that it would perhaps have been better to send him into Ravenna at once. It was, however, too late to rectify the mistake. The Governor, when sending in to the Legate his report of the arrest, had begged, as a special favour, permission to superintend personally the investigation of this case; and, his request having been graciously acceded to, he could not now withdraw without a humiliating confession that he was overmatched.</p> 
<p>The idea of settling the difficulty by a courtmartial had, as Gemma and Michele had foreseen, presented itself to him as the only satisfactory solution; and Cardinal Montanelli's stubborn refusal to countenance this was the last drop which made the cup of his vexations overflow.</p> 
<p>"I think," he said, "that if Your Eminence knew what I and my assistants have put up with from this man you would feel differently about the matter. I fully understand and respect the conscientious objection to irregularities in judicial proceedings; but this is an exceptional case and calls for exceptional measures."</p> 
<p>"There is no case," Montanelli answered, "which calls for injustice; and to condemn a civilian by the judgment of a secret military tribunal is both unjust and illegal."</p> 
<p>"The case amounts to this, Your Eminence: The prisoner is manifestly guilty of several capital crimes. He joined the infamous attempt of Savigno, and the military commission nominated by Monsignor Spinola would certainly have had him shot or sent to the galleys then, had he not succeeded in escaping to Tuscany. Since that time he has never ceased plotting. He is known to be an influential member of one of the most pestilent secret societies in the country. He is gravely suspected of having consented to, if not inspired, the assassination of no less than three confidential police agents. He has been caught-- one might almost say--in the act of smuggling firearms into the Legation. He has offered armed resistance to authority and seriously wounded two officials in the discharge of their duty, and he is now a standing menace to the peace and order of the town. Surely, in such a case, a court-martial is justifiable."</p> 
<p>"Whatever the man has done," Montanelli replied, "he has the right to be judged according to law."</p> 
<p>"The ordinary course of law involves delay, Your Eminence, and in this case every moment is precious. Besides everything else, I am in constant terror of his escaping."</p> 
<p>"If there is any danger of that, it rests with you to guard him more closely."</p> 
<p>"I do my best, Your Eminence, but I am dependent upon the prison staff, and the man seems to have bewitched them all. I have changed the guard four times within three weeks; I have punished the soldiers till I am tired of it, and nothing is of any use. I can't prevent their carrying letters backwards and forwards. The fools are in love with him as if he were a woman."</p> 
<p>"That is very curious. There must be something remarkable about him."</p> 
<p>"There's a remarkable amount of devilry--I beg pardon, Your Eminence, but really this man is enough to try the patience of a saint. It's hardly credible, but I have to conduct all the interrogations myself, for the regular officer cannot stand it any longer."</p> 
<p>"How is that?"</p> 
<p>"It's difficult to explain. Your Eminence, but you would understand if you had once heard the way he goes on. One might think the interrogating officer were the criminal and he the judge."</p> 
<p>"But what is there so terrible that he can do? He can refuse to answer your questions, of course; but he has no weapon except silence."</p> 
<p>"And a tongue like a razor. We are all mortal, Your Eminence, and most of us have made mistakes in our time that we don't want published on the house-tops. That's only human nature, and it's hard on a man to have his little slips of twenty years ago raked up and thrown in his teeth----"</p> 
<p>"Has Rivarez brought up some personal secret of the interrogating officer?"</p> 
<p>"Well, really--the poor fellow got into debt when he was a cavalry officer, and borrowed a little sum from the regimental funds----"</p> 
<p>"Stole public money that had been intrusted to him, in fact?"</p> 
<p>"Of course it was very wrong, Your Eminence; but his friends paid it back at once, and the affair was hushed up,--he comes of a good family,--and ever since then he has been irreproachable. How Rivarez found out about it I can't conceive; but the first thing he did at interrogation was to bring up this old scandal--before the subaltern, too! And with as innocent a face as if he were saying his prayers! Of course the story's all over the Legation by now. If Your Eminence would only be present at one of the interrogations, I am sure you would realize---- He needn't know anything about it. You might overhear him from------"</p> 
<p>Montanelli turned round and looked at the Governor with an expression which his face did not often wear.</p> 
<p>"I am a minister of religion," he said; "not a police-spy; and eavesdropping forms no part of my professional duties."</p> 
<p>"I--I didn't mean to give offence------"</p> 
<p>"I think we shall not get any good out of discussing this question further. If you will send the prisoner here, I will have a talk with him."</p> 
<p>"I venture very respectfully to advise Your Eminence not to attempt it. The man is perfectly incorrigible. It would be both safer and wiser to overstep the letter of the law for this once, and get rid of him before he does any more mischief. It is with great diffidence that I venture to press the point after what Your Eminence has said; but after all I am responsible to Monsignor the Legate for the order of the town------"</p> 
<p>"And I," Montanelli interrupted, "am responsible to God and His Holiness that there shall be no underhand dealing in my diocese. Since you press me in the matter, colonel, I take my stand upon my privilege as Cardinal. I will not allow a secret court-martial in this town in peace-time. I will receive the prisoner here, and alone, at ten to-morrow morning."</p> 
<p>"As Your Eminence pleases," the Governor replied with sulky respectfulness; and went away, grumbling to himself: "They're about a pair, as far as obstinacy goes."</p> 
<p>He told no one of the approaching interview till it was actually time to knock off the prisoner's chains and start for the palace. It was quite enough, as he remarked to his wounded nephew, to have this Most Eminent son of Balaam's ass laying down the law, without running any risk of the soldiers plotting with Rivarez and his friends to effect an escape on the way.</p> 
<p>When the Gadfly, strongly guarded, entered the room where Montanelli was writing at a table covered with papers, a sudden recollection came over him, of a hot midsummer afternoon when he had sat turning over manuscript sermons in a study much like this. The shutters had been closed, as they were here, to keep out the heat, and a fruitseller's voice outside had called: "Fragola! Fragola!"</p> 
<p>He shook the hair angrily back from his eyes and set his mouth in a smile.</p> 
<p>Montanelli looked up from his papers.</p> 
<p>"You can wait in the hall," he said to the guards.</p> 
<p>"May it please Your Eminence," began the sergeant, in a lowered voice and with evident nervousness, "the colonel thinks that this prisoner is dangerous and that it would be better------"</p> 
<p>A sudden flash came into Montanelli's eyes.</p> 
<p>"You can wait in the hall," he repeated quietly; and the sergeant, saluting and stammering excuses with a frightened face, left the room with his men.</p> 
<p>"Sit down, please," said the Cardinal, when the door was shut. The Gadfly obeyed in silence.</p> 
<p>"Signor Rivarez," Montanelli began after a pause, "I wish to ask you a few questions, and shall be very much obliged to you if you will answer them."</p> 
<p>The Gadfly smiled. "My ch-ch-chief occupation at p-p-present is to be asked questions."</p> 
<p>"And--not to answer them? So I have heard; but these questions are put by officials who are investigating your case and whose duty is to use your answers as evidence."</p> 
<p>"And th-those of Your Eminence?" There was a covert insult in the tone more than in the words, and the Cardinal understood it at once; but his face did not lose its grave sweetness of expression.</p> 
<p>"Mine," he said, "whether you answer them or not, will remain between you and me. If they should trench upon your political secrets, of course you will not answer. Otherwise, though we are complete strangers to each other, I hope that you will do so, as a personal favour to me."</p> 
<p>"I am ent-t-tirely at the service of Your Eminence." He said it with a little bow, and a face that would have taken the heart to ask favours out of the daughters of the horse-leech.</p> 
<p>"First, then, you are said to have been smuggling firearms into this district. What are they wanted for?"</p> 
<p>"T-t-to k-k-kill rats with."</p> 
<p>"That is a terrible answer. Are all your fellow-men rats in your eyes if they cannot think as you do?"</p> 
<p>"S-s-some of them."</p> 
<p>Montanelli leaned back in his chair and looked at him in silence for a little while.</p> 
<p>"What is that on your hand?" he asked suddenly.</p> 
<p>The Gadfly glanced at his left hand. "Old m-m-marks from the teeth of some of the rats."</p> 
<p>"Excuse me; I was speaking of the other hand. That is a fresh hurt."</p> 
<p>The slender, flexible right hand was badly cut and grazed. The Gadfly held it up. The wrist was swollen, and across it ran a deep and long black bruise.</p> 
<p>"It is a m-m-mere trifle, as you see," he said. "When I was arrested the other day,--thanks to Your Eminence,"--he made another little bow,-- "one of the soldiers stamped on it."</p> 
<p>Montanelli took the wrist and examined it closely. "How does it come to be in such a state now, after three weeks?" he asked. "It is all inflamed."</p> 
<p>"Possibly the p-p-pressure of the iron has not done it much good."</p> 
<p>The Cardinal looked up with a frown.</p> 
<p>"Have they been putting irons on a fresh wound?"</p> 
<p>"N-n-naturally, Your Eminence; that is what fresh wounds are for. Old wounds are not much use. They will only ache; you c-c-can't make them burn properly."</p> 
<p>Montanelli looked at him again in the same close, scrutinizing way; then rose and opened a drawer full of surgical appliances.</p> 
<p>"Give me the hand," he said.</p> 
<p>The Gadfly, with a face as hard as beaten iron, held out the hand, and Montanelli, after bathing the injured place, gently bandaged it. Evidently he was accustomed to such work.</p> 
<p>"I will speak about the irons," he said. "And now I want to ask you another question: What do you propose to do?"</p> 
<p>"Th-th-that is very simply answered, Your Eminence. To escape if I can, and if I can't, to die."</p> 
<p>"Why 'to die'?"</p> 
<p>"Because if the Governor doesn't succeed in getting me shot, I shall be sent to the galleys, and for me that c-c-comes to the same thing. I have not got the health to live through it."</p> 
<p>Montanelli rested his arm on the table and pondered silently. The Gadfly did not disturb him. He was leaning back with half-shut eyes, lazily enjoying the delicious physical sensation of relief from the chains.</p> 
<p>"Supposing," Montanelli began again, "that you were to succeed in escaping; what should you do with your life?"</p> 
<p>"I have already told Your Eminence; I should k-k-kill rats."</p> 
<p>"You would kill rats. That is to say, that if I were to let you escape from here now,--supposing I had the power to do so,--you would use your freedom to foster violence and bloodshed instead of preventing them?"</p> 
<p>The Gadfly raised his eyes to the crucifix on the wall. "'Not peace, but a sword';--at l-least I should be in good company. For my own part, though, I prefer pistols."</p> 
<p>"Signor Rivarez," said the Cardinal with unruffled composure, "I have not insulted you as yet, or spoken slightingly of your beliefs or friends. May I not expect the same courtesy from you, or do you wish me to suppose that an atheist cannot be a gentleman?"</p> 
<p>"Ah, I q-quite forgot. Your Eminence places courtesy high among the Christian virtues. I remember your sermon in Florence, on the occasion of my c-controversy with your anonymous defender."</p> 
<p>"That is one of the subjects about which I wished to speak to you. Would you mind explaining to me the reason of the peculiar bitterness you seem to feel against me? If you have simply picked me out as a convenient target, that is another matter. Your methods of political controversy are your own affair, and we are not discussing politics now. But I fancied at the time that there was some personal animosity towards me; and if so, I should be glad to know whether I have ever done you wrong or in any way given you cause for such a feeling."</p> 
<p>Ever done him wrong! The Gadfly put up the bandaged hand to his throat. "I must refer Your Eminence to Shakspere," he said with a little laugh. "It's as with the man who can't endure a harmless, necessary cat. My antipathy is a priest. The sight of the cassock makes my t-t-teeth ache."</p> 
<p>"Oh, if it is only that----" Montanelli dismissed the subject with an indifferent gesture.</p> 
<p>"Still," he added, "abuse is one thing and perversion of fact is another. When you stated, in answer to my sermon, that I knew the identity of the anonymous writer, you made a mistake,--I do not accuse you of wilful falsehood,--and stated what was untrue. I am to this day quite ignorant of his name."</p> 
<p>The Gadfly put his head on one side, like an intelligent robin, looked at him for a moment gravely, then suddenly threw himself back and burst into a peal of laughter.</p> 
<p>"S-s-sancta simplicitas! Oh, you, sweet, innocent, Arcadian people--and you never guessed! You n-never saw the cloven hoof?"</p> 
<p>Montanelli stood up. "Am I to understand, Signor Rivarez, that you wrote both sides of the controversy yourself?"</p> 
<p>"It was a shame, I know," the Gadfly answered, looking up with wide, innocent blue eyes. "And you s-s-swallowed everything whole; just as if it had been an oyster. It was very wrong; but oh, it w-w-was so funny!"</p> 
<p>Montanelli bit his lip and sat down again. He had realized from the first that the Gadfly was trying to make him lose his temper, and had resolved to keep it whatever happened; but he was beginning to find excuses for the Governor's exasperation. A man who had been spending two hours a day for the last three weeks in interrogating the Gadfly might be pardoned an occasional swear-word.</p> 
<p>"We will drop that subject," he said quietly. "What I wanted to see you for particularly is this: My position here as Cardinal gives me some voice, if I choose to claim my privilege, in the question of what is to be done with you. The only use to which I should ever put such a privilege would be to interfere in case of any violence to you which was not necessary to prevent you from doing violence to others. I sent for you, therefore, partly in order to ask whether you have anything to complain of,--I will see about the irons; but perhaps there is something else,--and partly because I felt it right, before giving my opinion, to see for myself what sort of man you are."</p> 
<p>"I have nothing to complain of, Your Eminence. 'A la guerre comme a la guerre.' I am not a schoolboy, to expect any government to pat me on the head for s-s-smuggling firearms onto its territory. It's only natural that they should hit as hard as they can. As for what sort of man I am, you have had a romantic confession of my sins once. Is not that enough; or w-w-would you like me to begin again?"</p> 
<p>"I don't understand you," Montanelli said coldly, taking up a pencil and twisting it between his fingers.</p> 
<p>"Surely Your Eminence has not forgotten old Diego, the pilgrim?" He suddenly changed his voice and began to speak as Diego: "I am a miserable sinner------"</p> 
<p>The pencil snapped in Montanelli's hand. "That is too much!" he said.</p> 
<p>The Gadfly leaned his head back with a soft little laugh, and sat watching while the Cardinal paced silently up and down the room.</p> 
<p>"Signor Rivarez," said Montanelli, stopping at last in front of him, "you have done a thing to me that a man who was born of a woman should hesitate to do to his worst enemy. You have stolen in upon my private grief and have made for yourself a mock and a jest out of the sorrow of a fellow-man. I once more beg you to tell me: Have I ever done you wrong? And if not, why have you played this heartless trick on me?"</p> 
<p>The Gadfly, leaning back against the chair-cushions, looked up with his subtle, chilling, inscrutable smile</p> 
<p>"It am-m-mused me, Your Eminence; you took it all so much to heart, and it rem-m-minded me-- a little bit--of a variety show----"</p> 
<p>Montanelli, white to the very lips, turned away and rang the bell.</p> 
<p>"You can take back the prisoner," he said when the guards came in.</p> 
<p>After they had gone he sat down at the table, still trembling with unaccustomed indignation, and took up a pile of reports which had been sent in to him by the parish priests of his diocese.</p> 
<p>Presently he pushed them away, and, leaning on the table, hid his face in both hands. The Gadfly seemed to have left some terrible shadow of himself, some ghostly trail of his personality, to haunt the room; and Montanelli sat trembling and cowering, not daring to look up lest he should see the phantom presence that he knew was not there. The spectre hardly amounted to a hallucination. It was a mere fancy of overwrought nerves; but he was seized with an unutterable dread of its shadowy presence--of the wounded hand, the smiling, cruel mouth, the mysterious eyes, like deep sea water----</p> 
<p>He shook off the fancy and settled to his work. All day long he had scarcely a free moment, and the thing did not trouble him; but going into his bedroom late at night, he stopped on the threshold with a sudden shock of fear. What if he should see it in a dream? He recovered himself immediately and knelt down before the crucifix to pray.</p> 
<p>But he lay awake the whole night through.</p> 
<p>“我再次诚恳地向您保证，主教阁下，您的拒绝危及了本城的治安。”</p> 
<p>统领试图保持对教会一位高层人士应有的尊敬语气，但是从他的声音里可以听出他的恼怒。他的肝脏出了毛病，他的妻子欠帐太多，他的脾气在过去三个星期里经受了严重的考验。公众愤怒而又不满，他们的危险情绪显然与日俱增；教区充满了阴谋，武器泛滥成灾；警备部队碌碌无能，他非常怀疑这支部队的忠诚；还有这位红衣主教，他已使他几乎陷入绝望。在对他的副官谈话时，他不无悲哀地把红衣主教描绘成“不折不扣的顽固化身”。现在他摊上了牛虻这个负担，牛虻活活就是一个恶魔的化身。</p> 
<p>那个“跛脚的西班牙恶魔”打伤了他心爱的侄儿和最有价值的暗探，现在又扩大了他在集市取得的战果，煽动那些看守，吓唬审问官，并把“监狱变成了要熊的场所”。他在城堡里已有三个星期，布里西盖拉当局对于这宗买卖深恶痛绝。</p> 
<p>他们一次又一次地审问他。为了让他招供，他们动用了所能想出的各种手段，威胁、劝诱和计谋一齐而上。可是他仍旧像在被捕那天一样诡诈。他们已经意识到也许最好还是立即把他押往拉文纳，可是已经无法及时纠正这个错误了。统领在把捕获的报告呈交教皇特使时，曾经特意要求亲自监督这个案件的审理。这个要求已经承蒙批准，他现在撤回这个要求，就会丢尽脸面，承认他不是对手。</p> 
<p>正如琼玛和米歇尔所预见的那样，设立军事法庭来解决这个问题，对他来说是唯一令他满意的途径。红衣主教蒙泰尼里非常固执，拒绝支持这个设想，这使他忍无可忍。</p> 
<p>“我认为，”他说，“如果主教阁下知道我和我的助手所忍受的一切，您对这件事就会有不同的看法。您凭着良心反对司法程序的不当之处，对此我完全理解并且表示尊重。但是这是一个特别的案子，特别的案子要求采取特别的措施。”</p> 
<p>“没有一个案子不要求公正，”蒙泰尼里回答，“如果根据一个秘密军事法庭的裁决来给一个平民定罪，那么这不仅是不公正的，而且也是非法的。”</p> 
<p>“这个案子非常严重，主教阁下，这个犯人公然犯下了数项死罪。他参加了臭名昭著的萨维尼奥暴动，如果他不是逃到了托斯卡纳，斯宾诺拉大人任命的军事委员会那时肯定就会把他枪毙，或者把他送去服划船的苦役。从那以后，他就一直没有停止密谋策划。据悉他参加了国内一个怙恶不悛的秘密团体，并是这个团体中的一位重要成员。我们确实怀疑他即使没有唆使，那么他也是同意暗杀了不少于三名警察秘密特工。可以说他是在把武器私自运进教省时被当场抓获的。他竟然抗命持枪拒捕，并且重伤了两名执行任务的警官。现在他对本城的治安已经构成了永久的威胁。在这样一个案子中，设立军事法庭当然是正当的。”</p> 
<p>“不管这人做了什么，”蒙泰尼里回答，“他都有权依照法律来审判他。”</p> 
<p>“依照法律的正常程序就得耽搁时间，主教阁下，在这个案子中，片刻的时间都耽搁不得。此外，我还担心他会越狱。”</p> 
<p>“如果有这个危险，你就应该严加看管他。”</p> 
<p>“我会尽力而为，主教阁下，但是我得依靠监狱的看守，他们好像全被那个家伙给迷惑了。我在三个星期内四次更换了看守。我已不厌其烦地处罚了那些士兵，可是这一切全都没用。我不能阻止他们来回传递信件。那些傻瓜爱上了他，好像他是个女人。”</p> 
<p>“这倒非常奇怪。他肯定是有什么过人之处。”</p> 
<p>“过人的邪恶之处——请您原谅，主教阁下，但是这个家伙确实足以让圣人也失去耐心。真是难以置信，但是我还得亲自主持审问，因为一般的军官再也忍受不了。”</p> 
<p>“怎么会这样呢？”</p> 
<p>“很难解释清楚，主教阁下，他信口雌黄，你一旦听过就明白了。别人还以为审讯官是犯人，而他却是法官。”</p> 
<p>“但是他有什么厉害之处呢？他当然可以拒绝回答问题，可是他除了沉默没有别的武器。”</p> 
<p>“刺刀一样的舌头。我们全是凡人，主教阁下，我们大多数人都曾犯过我们不愿公之于众的错误。这是人性使然，让他唠叨出二十年前犯下的小小过失，谁也受不了——”</p> 
<p>“里瓦雷兹兜出了审讯官的一些私人秘密吗？”</p> 
<p>“我们——真的——那个可怜的家伙还是一名骑兵军官时欠了债，于是就从团里的资金借了一笔钱——”</p> 
<p>“事实上是偷窃了交他保管的公款？”</p> 
<p>“这当然是错误的，主教阁下，但是他的朋友随后就把钱还了，这事就遮盖了下来——他出身很好——从那以后他是一身清白。至于里瓦雷兹是怎么获悉了这个事情，我就想象不出了。但是他在审讯时所做的第一件事情就是兜出这起丑闻——竟然当着下属的面！而且还摆出一副天真的表情，就像是在祈祷一样！这个事情现在已经传遍了教省。如果主教阁下能够出席一次审讯，我相信您就会认识到——这事不必让他知道。您可以在一旁偷听——”</p> 
<p>蒙泰尼里转过身来看着统领，脸上露出了不同寻常的表情。</p> 
<p>“我是宗教使者，”他说，“不是警察的暗探，偷听不是我的职责。”</p> 
<p>“——我并不是想惹您生气——”</p> 
<p>“我认为这个问题再讨论下去没有什么好处。如果你把犯人送到这儿，我会和他谈谈。”</p> 
<p>“我斗胆劝告主教阁下不要这样做。这个家伙完全是死不改悔。应该不要拘泥于法律的规定，立即把他干掉，免得再让他去犯罪。这样不仅更加安全，而且更加明智。在您表达了意见以后，我还得斗胆恳请您接受我的观点。但是不管怎样，我要对特使大人负责，维护本城的治安——”</p> 
<p>“我呢，”蒙泰尼里打断了他的话，“要对上帝和圣父负责，确保在我的教区内没有见不得人的行径。既然你在这个问题上逼我就范，上校，那么我就行使红衣主教的特权。我不许和平时期在本城设立一个秘密军事法庭。我要在这里单独接见犯人，明天上午十点。”</p> 
<p>“听凭主教阁下的吩咐。”统领带着愠怒的敬意回答，随后走开。一路上，他暗自嘟哝：“他们倒是一对，一样固执。”</p> 
<p>他没对任何人提及红衣主教将要接见犯人，到了时间才让人打开犯人的镣铐，然后把他押往宫里。他对受伤的侄子说，贝拉姆那头驴子的杰出子孙发号施令［出自《圣经》故事，贝拉姆是一位先知，他因诅咒以色列人，被他所骑的驴子用人语叱骂。这里上校是借此辱骂蒙泰尼里是一个固执的人。］，就已够让人受不了，可是还要担当风险，防止那些士兵和里瓦雷兹及其死党串通一气，计划在途中把他劫走。</p> 
<p>当牛虻在严加看守下走进屋子时，蒙泰尼里正伏在一张堆满公文的桌子上写着东西。他突然想起一个炎热的仲夏下午，当时他坐在就像这间屋子的书房里翻着布道手稿。百叶窗关着，就像这里一样，不让热气进来。一个水果贩子在外面叫道：“草莓！草莓！”</p> 
<p>他愤怒地甩开眼前的头发，嘴上露出了笑容。</p> 
<p>蒙泰尼里从公文堆里抬起头来。</p> 
<p>“你们可以在门厅里等候。”他对卫兵们说。</p> 
<p>“主教大人，请您原谅。”军曹小声说道，显然慌了神。</p> 
<p>“上校认为这个犯人很危险，最好——”</p> 
<p>蒙泰尼里的眼里突然露出了一道闪光。</p> 
<p>“你们可以在门厅里等候。”他又重复了一遍，声音平静。</p> 
<p>军曹大惊失色，敬了一礼，结结巴巴地告辞，然后带着手下的士兵离开了房间。</p> 
<p>“请坐。”门关上以后，红衣主教说道。牛虻一声不吭地坐了下来。</p> 
<p>“里瓦雷兹先生，”停顿片刻以后，蒙泰尼里开口说道，“我希望问你几个问题，如果你回答，我将不胜感激。”</p> 
<p>牛虻微微一笑。“目、目、目前我的主、主、主要职业就是被人提问。”</p> 
<p>“那么——不作回答吗？这我已经听说了，但是那些问题是调查你的案子的官员提出来的，他们的职责是利用你的回答作为证据。”</p> 
<p>“那么主教阁下的问题呢？”语调隐含的侮辱甚于言辞的侮辱，红衣主教立即就听出来了，但是他的面庞并没失去庄严而又和蔼的表情。</p> 
<p>“我的问题，”他说，“不管你回答与否，始终只有咱俩知道。如果问题涉及你的政治秘密，你当然不作回答。如若不然，尽管我们都是素昧平生，我希望你能回答我的问题，就算帮我个人一个忙吧。”</p> 
<p>“我完、完、完全听凭主教阁下的吩咐。”他说罢微微鞠了一躬，脸上的表情就连贪得无厌的人们都不敢鼓起勇气求他帮忙。</p> 
<p>“那么，首先，据说你一直在把武器私自运进这一地区。它们是拿来做什么用的？”</p> 
<p>“是、是、是杀、杀、杀老鼠。”</p> 
<p>“这个回答可真吓人。如果你的同胞和你的想法不同，在你的眼里他们就是老鼠吗？”</p> 
<p>“有、有、有些人是。”</p> 
<p>蒙泰尼里靠在椅背上，默默地看了他有一小会儿。</p> 
<p>“你的手上是什么？”他突然问道。</p> 
<p>牛虻瞥了一眼他的左手。“一些老鼠牙咬的旧疤、疤、疤痕。”</p> 
<p>“对不起，我说的是另一只手。那是新伤。”</p> 
<p>瘦弱而又灵巧的右手布满了割伤和擦伤。牛虻把它举了起来。手腕已经肿了，上面有一道又深又长的黑色伤口。</p> 
<p>“小、小、小事一桩，这您也能看得出来。”他说，“那天我被捕时——多亏了主教阁下。”——他又微微鞠了一躬——“一个当兵的给踩的。”</p> 
<p>蒙泰尼里拿起手腕仔细端详。“过了三个星期，现在怎么还是这样？”他问。“全都发了炎。”</p> 
<p>“可能是镣铐的压、压、压力对它没有什么好处。”</p> 
<p>红衣主教抬起了头，眉头紧锁。</p> 
<p>“他们一直都把镣铐扣在新伤上吗？”</p> 
<p>“那是自、自、自然了，主教阁下。这就是新伤的用途，旧伤可没有用。旧伤只会作痛，你不能让它们产生正常的灼痛。”</p> 
<p>蒙泰尼里又凑近仔细端详了一番，然后起身打开装满外科器械的抽屉。</p> 
<p>“把手给我。”他说。</p> 
<p>牛虻伸出手去，脸上绷得就像敲扁的铁块。蒙泰尼里清洗了受伤的地方以后，轻轻地把它缠上了绷带。他显然习惯于做这样的工作。</p> 
<p>“镣铐的事儿我会跟他们谈谈，”他说，“现在我想问你另外一个问题：你打算怎么办？”</p> 
<p>“这、这、这很容易回答，主教阁下。能逃就逃，逃不了就死。”</p> 
<p>“为什么要‘死’呢？”</p> 
<p>“因为如果统领无法枪毙我，我就会被送去服划船的苦役。对我来说，结、结、结果是一样的。我的身体受不了。”</p> 
<p>蒙泰尼里把胳膊支在桌子上，陷入了沉思。牛虻没去打扰他。他眯起眼睛靠在椅背上，懒散地享受着解除镣铐以后的轻松感觉。</p> 
<p>“假设，”蒙泰尼里再次开口说道，“你逃了出去，以后你怎么办呢？”</p> 
<p>“我已经告诉过您，主教阁下。我会杀老鼠。”</p> 
<p>“你会杀老鼠。这就是说，如果我现在让你从这儿逃走——假设我有权这样做——你会利用你的自由鼓动暴力和流血，而不是阻止暴力和流血吗？”</p> 
<p>牛虻抬起眼睛望着墙上的十字架。</p> 
<p>“不是和平，而是宝剑［此语引自《圣经》。耶稣有一次曾对他的信徒说：“你们不要以为我带着和平来到世上；我带来的不是和平，而是剑。”］——至、至少我应该和善良的人们待在一起。就我本身来说，我更喜欢手枪。”</p> 
<p>“里瓦雷兹先生，”红衣主教不失镇静地说道，“我还没有侮辱过你，也没有蔑视你的信仰和朋友。我就不能指望从你那里得到同样的礼遇吗？抑或你还是希望我假定无神论者不能成为谦谦君子吗？”</p> 
<p>“噢，我给忘、忘得一干二净。在基督教的道德中，主教阁下看重的是礼节。我想起了您在佛罗伦萨的布道，当时我和您的匿名辩护者展开了一场论、论战。”</p> 
<p>“这正是我想和你谈的话题之一。你能向我解释一下原因吗？你好像对我怀有一种特别的怨恨。如果你只是把我当成一个便利的靶子，那就是另外一回事。你那一套政治论战的方法是你自己的事情，我们现在不谈政治。但是我当时相信你对我怀有一些个人的仇恨。如果是这样，我乐于知道我是否让你受过委屈，或者在什么方面致使你引发了这样的情感。”</p> 
<p>让他受过委屈！牛虻抬起缠了绷带的那只手放在喉咙上。</p> 
<p>“我必须向主教阁下引述莎士比亚的话。”他说，并且轻声笑了一下。“‘就像那人一样，无法忍受一只无害且必需的小猫［典出莎士比亚的喜剧《威尼斯商人》，意为各人的好恶不同，有些事情是没有什么理由的。’］。我讨厌的就是教士。见到法衣我的牙、牙、牙齿就疼。”</p> 
<p>“噢，如果只是——”蒙泰尼里作了一个满不在乎的手势，随即丢开了这个话题。“可是，”他补充说道，“辱骂是一回事，歪曲事实则是另外一回事。在答复我的布道时，你曾经说过我知道那位匿名作者的身份，这你就错了——我并不是指责你故意撒谎——你说的不是事实。直到今日，我对他的名字毫不知晓。”</p> 
<p>牛虻把头歪到一边，就像一只聪明的知更鸟，严肃地望了他一会儿，然后突然仰面放声大笑。</p> 
<p>“S—S—Sanctasimplicitas！［拉丁语：多么圣洁啊！］噢，你们这些可爱而又天真的阿卡迪亚人——你猜不到的！你没、没有看出恶魔的象征吧？”</p> 
<p>蒙泰尼里站了起来。“我得明白，里瓦雷兹先生，论战双方的文章都是你一人写的吗？”</p> 
<p>“这是一件丑事，我知道。”牛虻抬起那双纯真的蓝色大眼睛回答。“而你竟然吞、吞、吞下了这一切，就像吞下了一只牡蛎。这样做很不应该，但是，噢，太、太、太有趣了。”</p> 
<p>蒙泰尼里咬着嘴唇，重又坐了下来。从一开始他就意识到牛虻想让他发脾气，他已经决定不管发生什么都要克制自己。但是他开始为统领的恼怒寻找借口。一个人在过去三个星期里，每天都要花上两个小时审讯牛虻，偶尔骂上一句，确实可以原谅。</p> 
<p>“我们还是丢开这个话题，”他平静地说，“我想见你的具体原因是：我在这里担任红衣主教，在怎么处置你的问题上，如果我选择行使我的特权，我的话还是有些分量的。我要行使特权的唯一用途是干涉对你动用暴力。为了阻止你对别人动用暴力，对你动用暴力不不必要的。因此，我派人把你带到这里来，部分原因是问你有什么抱怨的——我会处理镣铐一事，但是也许还有别的事情——部分原因是在我发表意见之前，我觉得应该亲眼看看你是什么样的人。”</p> 
<p>“我没有什么抱怨的，主教阁下。alaguerrecommeàguerre．［法语：在战争中，我们必须遵循战争的惯例。］我不是一个学童，把武器私自运进境内，竟还指望政府拍拍我的脑袋。他们使劲揍我，这是自然的。至于我是什么样的人，您曾听过我作的一次浪漫的忏悔。那还不够吗？抑或你愿—愿—愿意我再来一次吗？”</p> 
<p>“我听不懂你在说些什么。”蒙泰尼里冷冷地说道，随即拿起一支铅笔在手中玩弄。</p> 
<p>“主教阁下当然没有忘记老迭亚戈吧？”他突然改变了他的声音，开始像迭亚戈一样开口说道，“我是一个苦命的罪人——”</p> 
<p>铅笔啪的一声在蒙泰尼里手中折断了。“这太过分了！”</p> 
<p>牛虻仰面靠在椅背上，轻声地笑了一下。他坐在那里，望着红衣主教一声不吭地在屋里踱来踱去。</p> 
<p>“里瓦雷兹先生，”蒙泰尼里说道，最终停下了脚步，“你对我做了一件任何一个出自娘胎的人对其不共戴天之敌都不肯做的事情。你窥探了我个人的悲伤，并且挖苦和嘲弄另一个人的痛苦。我再次恳请你告诉我：我让你受过委屈吗？如果没有，你为什么对我耍弄这样丧尽天良的玩笑呢？”</p> 
<p>牛虻靠在椅垫上，带着神秘、冷酷和费解的微笑望着他。</p> 
<p>“我觉得好、好、好玩，主教阁下。你对这一切那么在乎，这使、使、使我——有点——想起了杂耍表演——”</p> 
<p>蒙泰尼里连嘴唇都气得发白。他转身摇响了铃。</p> 
<p>“你们可以把犯人带回去了。”他在看守进来时说道。</p> 
<p>他们走了以后，他坐在桌边，仍然气得浑身发抖。他从来没有气成这样。他拿起了他这个教区里的教士呈交的报告。</p> 
<p>他很快就把它们推到一边。他靠在桌上，双手捂住了他的脸。牛虻好像已经留下了他那可怕的阴影，他那幽灵般的痕迹就在这间屋子里游荡。蒙泰尼里坐在那里，浑身发抖，直打哆嗦。他不敢抬起头来，以免看见他知道这里并不存在的幻影。那个幽灵连幻觉都算不上。只是过度疲劳的神经所产生的一个幻想。但是他却感到它的阴影有着一种难以言喻的恐怖——那只受伤的手，那种微笑，那张冷酷的嘴巴，那双神秘的眼睛，就像深深的海水——</p> 
<p>他摆脱掉那个幻想，重又处理他的工作。他一整天都没有闲暇的时间，可这并没有使他感到烦恼。但是深夜回到卧室时，他在门槛前停下了脚步，突然感到一阵害怕。如果他在梦中看见它怎么办？他立即恢复了自制，跪倒在十字架前祈祷。</p> 
<p>但是他彻夜都没有入眠。</p>
