<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; How hath the LORD covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger! 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; How has the daughter of Zion been covered with a cloud by the Lord in his wrath! he has sent down from heaven to earth the glory of Israel, and has not kept in memory the resting-place of his feet in the day of his wrath. 
<br>2:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 主 吞 灭 雅 各 一 切 的 住 处 ， 并 不 顾 惜 。 他 发 怒 倾 覆 犹 大 民 的 保 障 ， 使 这 保 障 坍 倒 在 地 。 他 辱 没 这 国 和 其 中 的 首 领 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; The LORD hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought them down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The Lord has given up to destruction all the living-places of Jacob without pity; pulling down in his wrath the strong places of the daughter of Judah, stretching out on the earth the wounded, even her king and her rulers. 
<br>2:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 发 烈 怒 ， 把 以 色 列 的 角 全 然 砍 断 ， 在 仇 敌 面 前 收 回 右 手 。 他 像 火 焰 四 围 吞 灭 ， 将 雅 各 烧 毁 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; In his burning wrath every horn of Israel has been cut off; his right hand has been turned back before the attacker: he has put a fire in Jacob, causing destruction round about. 
<br>2:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 张 弓 好 像 仇 敌 。 他 站 着 举 起 右 手 ， 如 同 敌 人 将 悦 人 眼 目 的 ， 尽 行 杀 戮 。 在 锡 安 百 姓 的 帐 棚 上 倒 出 他 的 忿 怒 ， 像 火 一 样 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; His bow has been bent for the attack, he has taken his place with his hand ready, in his hate he has put to death all who were pleasing to the eye: on the tent of the daughter of Zion he has let loose his passion like fire. 
<br>2:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 主 如 仇 敌 吞 灭 以 色 列 和 锡 安 的 一 切 宫 殿 ， 拆 毁 百 姓 的 保 障 。 在 犹 大 民 中 加 增 悲 伤 哭 号 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; The LORD was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The Lord has become like one fighting against her, sending destruction on Israel; he has sent destruction on all her great houses, making waste his strong places: increasing the grief and the sorrow of the daughter of Judah. 
<br>2:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 强 取 自 己 的 帐 幕 ， 好 像 是 园 中 的 窝 棚 ， 毁 坏 他 的 聚 会 之 处 。 耶 和 华 使 圣 节 和 安 息 日 在 锡 安 都 被 忘 记 ， 又 在 怒 气 的 愤 恨 中 藐 视 君 王 和 祭 司 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he has violently taken away his tent, as from a garden; he has made waste his meeting-place: the Lord has taken away the memory of feast and Sabbath in Zion, and in the passion of his wrath he is against king and priest. 
<br>2:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 和 华 丢 弃 自 己 的 祭 坛 ， 憎 恶 自 己 的 圣 所 ， 将 宫 殿 的 墙 垣 交 付 仇 敌 。 他 们 在 耶 和 华 的 殿 中 喧 嚷 ， 像 在 圣 会 之 日 一 样 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; The LORD hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The Lord has given up his altar and has been turned in hate from his holy place; he has given up into the hands of the attacker the walls of her great houses: their voices have been loud in the house of the Lord as in the day of a holy meeting. 
<br>2:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 和 华 定 意 拆 毁 锡 安 的 城 墙 。 他 拉 了 准 绳 ， 不 将 手 收 回 ， 定 要 毁 灭 。 他 使 外 郭 和 城 墙 都 悲 哀 ， 一 同 衰 败 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; It is the Lord's purpose to make waste the wall of the daughter of Zion; his line has been stretched out, he has not kept back his hand from destruction: he has sent sorrow on tower and wall, they have become feeble together. 
<br>2:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 锡 安 的 门 都 陷 入 地 内 。 主 将 她 的 门 闩 毁 坏 ， 折 断 。 她 的 君 王 和 首 领 落 在 没 有 律 法 的 列 国 中 。 她 的 先 知 不 得 见 耶 和 华 的 异 象 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Her doors have gone down into the earth; he has sent destruction on her locks: her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not; even her prophets have had no vision from the Lord. 
<br>2:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 锡 安 城 的 长 老 坐 在 地 上 默 默 无 声 。 他 们 扬 起 尘 土 落 在 头 上 ， 腰 束 麻 布 。 耶 路 撒 冷 的 处 女 垂 头 至 地 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The responsible men of the daughter of Zion are seated on the earth without a word; they have put dust on their heads, they are clothed in haircloth: the heads of the virgins of Jerusalem are bent down to the earth. 
<br>2:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 眼 中 流 泪 ， 以 致 失 明 ， 我 的 心 肠 扰 乱 ， 肝 胆 涂 地 ， 都 因 我 众 民 遭 毁 灭 ， 又 因 孩 童 和 吃 奶 的 在 城 内 街 上 发 昏 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Mine eyes do fail with tears, my bowels are troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; My eyes are wasted with weeping, the inmost parts of my body are deeply moved, my inner parts are drained out on the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because of the young children and babies at the breast who are falling without strength in the open squares of the town. 
<br>2:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 时 ， 他 们 在 城 内 街 上 发 昏 ， 好 像 受 伤 的 ， 在 母 亲 的 怀 里 ， 将 要 丧 命 。 对 母 亲 说 ， 谷 酒 在 哪 里 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; They say to their mothers, Where is corn and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers' bosom. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; They say to their mothers, Where is grain and wine? when they are falling like the wounded in the open squares of the town, when their life is drained out on their mother's breast. 
<br>2:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 路 撒 冷 的 民 哪 ， 我 可 用 什 么 向 你 证 明 呢 ？ 我 可 用 什 么 与 你 相 比 呢 ？ 锡 安 的 民 哪 ， 我 可 拿 什 么 和 你 比 较 ， 好 安 慰 你 呢 ？ 因 为 你 的 裂 口 大 如 海 ， 谁 能 医 治 你 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; What example am I to give you? what comparison am I to make for you, O daughter of Jerusalem? what am I to make equal to you, so that I may give you comfort, O virgin daughter of Zion? for your destruction is great like the sea: who is able to make you well? 
<br>2:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 的 先 知 为 你 见 虚 假 和 愚 昧 的 异 象 ， 并 没 有 显 露 你 的 罪 孽 ， 使 你 被 掳 的 归 回 。 却 为 你 见 虚 假 的 默 示 和 使 你 被 赶 出 本 境 的 缘 故 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not discovered thine iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The visions which your prophets have seen for you are false and foolish; they have not made clear to you your sin so that your fate might be changed: but they have seen for you false words, driving you away. 
<br>2:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 凡 过 路 的 都 向 你 拍 掌 。 他 们 向 耶 路 撒 冷 城 嗤 笑 ， 摇 头 ， 说 ， 难 道 人 所 称 为 全 美 的 ， 称 为 全 地 所 喜 悦 的 ， 就 是 这 城 吗 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; All who go by make a noise with their hands at you; they make hisses, shaking their heads at the daughter of Jerusalem, and saying, Is this the town which was the crown of everything beautiful, the joy of all the earth? 
<br>2:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 的 仇 敌 都 向 你 大 大 张 口 。 他 们 嗤 笑 ， 又 切 齿 说 ， 我 们 吞 灭 她 。 这 真 是 我 们 所 盼 望 的 日 子 临 到 了 。 我 们 亲 眼 看 见 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; All thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up: certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; All your haters are opening their mouths wide against you; making hisses and whistling through their teeth, they say, We have made a meal of her: certainly this is the day we have been looking for; it has come, we have seen it. 
<br>2:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 和 华 成 就 了 他 所 定 的 ， 应 验 了 他 古 时 所 命 定 的 。 他 倾 覆 了 ， 并 不 顾 惜 ， 使 你 的 仇 敌 向 你 夸 耀 。 使 你 敌 人 的 角 也 被 高 举 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; The LORD hath done that which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The Lord has done that which was his purpose; he has put into force the orders which he gave in the days which are past; pulling down without pity, he has made your hater glad over you, lifting up the horn of those who were against you. 
<br>2:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 锡 安 民 的 心 哀 求 主 。 锡 安 的 城 墙 阿 ， 愿 你 流 泪 如 河 ， 昼 夜 不 息 。 愿 你 眼 中 的 瞳 人 泪 流 不 止 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Their heart cried unto the LORD, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Let your cry go up to the Lord: O wall of the daughter of Zion, let your weeping be flowing down like a stream day and night; give yourself no rest, let not your eyes keep back the drops of sorrow. 
<br>2:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 夜 间 ， 每 逢 交 更 的 时 候 要 起 来 呼 喊 ， 在 主 面 前 倾 心 如 水 。 你 的 孩 童 在 各 市 口 上 受 饿 发 昏 。 你 要 为 他 们 的 性 命 向 主 举 手 祷 告 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the LORD: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger in the top of every street. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Up! give cries in the night, at the starting of the night-watches; let your heart be flowing out like water before the face of the Lord, lifting up your hands to him for the life of your young children who are falling down, feeble for need of food, at the top of every street. 
<br>2:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 观 看 。 见 你 向 谁 这 样 行 。 妇 人 岂 可 吃 自 己 所 生 育 手 里 所 摇 弄 的 婴 孩 吗 ？ 祭 司 和 先 知 岂 可 在 主 的 圣 所 中 被 杀 戮 吗 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Look! O Lord, see to whom you have done this! Are the women to take as their food the fruit of their bodies, the children who are folded in their arms? are the priest and the prophet to be put to death in the holy place of the Lord? 
<br>2:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 少 年 人 和 老 年 人 都 在 街 上 躺 卧 。 我 的 处 女 和 壮 丁 都 倒 在 刀 下 。 你 发 怒 的 日 子 杀 死 他 们 。 你 杀 了 ， 并 不 顾 惜 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, and not pitied. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The young men and the old are stretched on the earth in the streets; my virgins and my young men have been put to the sword: you have sent death on them in the day of your wrath, causing death without pity. 
<br>2:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 招 聚 四 围 惊 吓 我 的 ， 像 在 大 会 的 日 子 招 聚 人 一 样 。 耶 和 华 发 怒 的 日 子 ， 无 人 逃 脱 ， 无 人 存 留 。 我 所 摇 弄 所 养 育 的 婴 孩 ， 仇 敌 都 杀 净 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD's anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; As in the day of a holy meeting you have made fears come round me on every side, and no one got away or was kept safe in the day of the Lord's wrath: those who were folded in my arms, whom I took care of, have been sent to their destruction by my hater.
