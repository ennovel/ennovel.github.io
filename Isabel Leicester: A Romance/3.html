With Amy, however it was quite different, she seemed never so happy as when with Isabel.</p>

</div> 
<div>
 It was Sunday afternoon, the children did not seem to know how to employ themselves, but sat sullenly each with a book, tho' it was very evident that they were not reading. Indeed, Isabel had seen by their manners all day, that they had not been accustomed to have Sunday made pleasant.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Come here Amy dear," said Isabel, "would you like me to read to you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes please, for it makes my head ache to read all the afternoon."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 So Isabel read a portion of scripture and several nice little hymns. Very soon as she had expected, Alice and Rose, drew near. Then she read them part of the 'chief's daughter,' and after that she played several sacred pieces and sang a hymn to the tune tranquility. The children all gathered round her asking her to teach them to sing it. She promised to do so if they would learn the words, which they immediately commenced to do.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 After tea they had a most unexpected and very welcome visitor. "Oh! Everard, when did you come home," they all exclaimed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "While you were at church," he returned.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What a shame you didn't come to see us before," said Alice reproachfully.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "O then, I suppose it was you who shut the door when we were singing this afternoon," interposed Rose, "why didn't you come in."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I did not wish to disturb you" he answered, "but why don't some of you have the politeness to introduce me to your new governess."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Isabel colored deeply as he used the distasteful appellation, and bent lower over her book, and when Rose said, Mr. Everard Arlington, Miss Leicester," her bow was more haughty and dignified than she was aware of. He seated himself at the window with Amy on his knee, while the others stood one on either side. Isabel heard a great deal being said about Miss Leicester in an under tone, and was about to leave the room, when Everard interposed, saying "I shall go, unless you stay Miss Leicester, I'm not going to turn you out of the room."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Indeed I would rather go," said Isabel.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Indeed I would rather you stayed." returned Everard.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I do not wish to be any restraint on the children, it would be better for me to go."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well," said Everard putting his hand on the door, "I may as well have it out with you at once, as I did with Miss Manning, I am very fond of my little sisters, and often come to see them here."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have no objection, only let me go."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But that is just what I don't want you to do, and I always have my own way at Elm Grove. You must not run away whenever I come, or I shall think you consider me an intruder."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Never mind what I think," said Isabel looking up, about to insist upon going, for she was very indignant at his behaviour, but the face she beheld quite disarmed her wrath. Such a calm, kind, earnest expression in the mild blue eyes, such a winning smile played round the handsome mouth, a more prepossessing countenance Isabel had never seen, there was something about it irresistibly attractive. "What is it you wish me to do," she asked as her eyes met his.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Stay where you are, and do just the same as if I was not here he said, and not run off as if I was going to eat you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then don't talk about me," she returned stiffly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I'm sure. I never said a word about you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But the children did," she replied coloring deeply as she returned to her seat.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Please Everard wont you read to us?" asked Amy.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 When he had finished, Amy asked Isabel if she would play the hymn she promised.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Not to-night dear," replied Isabel.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh please, Miss Leicester," coaxed Rose.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "If I am the cause of their disappointment I will go, but indeed I should like to join," said Everard.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "As you please" said Isabel, ashamed of being so much out of temper.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You know you promised, Miss Leicester," interposed Alice, gravely.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "So I did, dear," returned Isabel, going to the piano: and she was quite repaid, as they all sang very sweetly, and quite correctly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Good night," said Everard, when the hymn was ended.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Forgive me, Miss Leicester if I seemed rude, I did not intend to be."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Isabel was distressed to find how much the children had been neglected; true they were tolerably proficient in their studies, but in all religious instruction they were miserably deficient.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Left entirely to the care of Miss Manning, who was a very frivolous, worldly minded woman, they were led, (tho' perhaps unintentionally) to regard all religious subjects as dry and tedious, and to be avoided as much as possible. Isabel determined to try and remedy this evil by the exercise of patient gentleness, and by striving to make religious instruction a pleasure and a privilege. No easy task did this appear considering the dispositions she had to deal with, nor was it without a struggle that she put aside her own wishes and devoted her Sunday afternoons to this purpose. She certainly did not meet with much encouragement at first; again and again did the question recur to her mind, what good am I doing, why should I deprive myself of so many pleasant hours for the benefit of these thankless children; but the selfish thought was conquered, and she persevered. On week days also, she had morning prayer and read a portion of scripture, then they sung a hymn, always taking for the week the one they learnt on the Sunday afternoon. Nor was her perseverance unavailing, for the children became interested, and requested her to have evening service as they termed it, which of course Isabel was only too glad to do. After a while their morning numbers were increased, as Emily and her papa joined them, and so on until at last without any special arrangement they all assembled in the school-room every morning as a matter of course.

 Isabel was very different from what Mrs. Arlington had expected, so refined in her manners and tastes, so totally unfitted to combat with all the mortifications of a governess's career. True, she had expected a rather superior person, when Mrs. Arnold wrote that Miss Leicester was the indulged daughter of a wealthy merchant, who on account of her father's losses and subsequent death, was forced to gain her living by teaching. Still, she was not prepared to find her new governess such a lovely and sweet tempered girl, and Isabel had not been long at Elm Grove, before Mrs. Arlington found that she was becoming quite attached to her. And as Mr. Arlington found that her father was the same Mr. Leicester from whom he had formerly experienced great kindness, they decided Isabel should teach the children, and receive her salary, but that in all other respects she should be as one of the family, and Isabel was very glad of the change.&nbsp;
