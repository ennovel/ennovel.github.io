This place was called the wrecker's reef, and was covered at high water, but when the tide was low, Isabel and the others often went there to get shells. They had to be careful to watch the rise of the tide, as, long before the rock was covered the retreat was cut off by the water surrounding the largest rock, like an island, this island gradually diminished, until, when the tide was in it was several feet under water, this part of the coast was very little frequented. One afternoon when they had been at D---- about three weeks or a month, having obtained the shells they wished for, they sat down on the rocks to rest, Isabel began relating a tale she had lately read, and they were all so much interested, that they had not observed that the tide was fast coming in, nor was it until the rock was quite surrounded that they did so. The terrified children clung around Isabel entreating her to save them, while Emily scarcely less alarmed, screamed aloud for help, but it was not very likely that her cries for assistance would be heard in that lonely place, and their danger became more imminent, as a stiff breeze had sprung up, and the surge round the reef was becoming very heavy, and even should they be observed, the passage from the beach to the reef was so dangerous, that only a skilful and experienced hand could possibly succeed in rescuing them from their perilous situation, so that although there was a small boat moored on the beach it did not afford them much consolation. They were constantly drenched with spray, and were quite aware that the reef would be covered with water ere long.</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh dearest Isabel, what shall we do," asked Emily, looking ghastly white, and shaking like an aspen.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The water will wash us all away, and then we shall all be drowned," cried little Amy.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "And we shall never see papa and mamma any more,' added Rose. Alice stood perfectly quiet, (after the first moment of their surprise when she had clung to Isabel with the rest) her large eyes fixed upon Isabel with an expression that spoke volumes.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I fear there is no escape," said Isabel, in as calm a tone as she could command, "we can only commend ourselves to the care of our heavenly Father, and patiently await his will. This they did, and then Isabel endeavored to calm litttle Amy, who was crying most piteously, but a shout of joy from Rose, drew her attention once more to the shore. "Here is Everard, oh here is Everard," cried Rose, clapping her hands and dancing with joy, and sure enough, there was Everard scrambling down the cliff. This was Saturday afternoon, and he had come to spend Sunday with them, but finding they were out he came in search of them, Norris, fortunately being able to tell him where they had gone.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 As the reef was such a short distance from land, and as a boat was moored on the beach, the children naturally concluded that they were now safe. It was not so however with Isabel, she knew the dangerous nature of this shallow water, with innumerable rocks only just beneath the surface, but still sufficiently covered to hide them from view, which made it very difficult to take a boat safely through them, even when the water was smooth, but how much more so, now that a rough swell was foaming over them. Indeed it was only by taking a zig-zag course, that any boat could be guided in safety through the labyrinth of rocks. As Everard was quite unacquainted with the perilous nature of the reef, it was well that Isabel had taken particular notice of the only passage and its curious windings, so that they were enabled to direct him how to steer, or the boat would assuredly have been knocked to pieces, and they all would inevitably have perished. But fortunately Everard was the crack oar of the college club, and the owner of the champion medal, and in spite of all difficulties managed to make his way to the reef.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Isabel had watched the progress of the boat with intense anxiety, her heart beat fast, for she expected every moment that it would come to grief, and she experienced an indescribable sensation of apprehension when it grated on the rock on which they stood.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, this boat won't hold us all," exclaimed Emily in dismay.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Don't leave me," entreated little Amy, "please don't."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No darling, you shall not be left," said Isabel kissing her and then lifting her into the boat. Quickly as this was done, Rose was already in; Isabel insisted upon both Emily and Alice going, though the boat was by this means very heavily laden--Alice would have remained with her, but Isabel would not allow it, as there was every prospect of the reef being entirely covered before the boat could possibly return.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But it seems so mean to leave you here alone." urged Alice.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It will not mend matters, if two are washed off instead of one," whispered Isabel, "go dear Alice while you can."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But it seems so mean," she repeated.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Come Alice," said Everard in a tone that settled the question at once, "every minute is of the greatest importance." It was agony to him to leave Isabel, but there was no help for it, the boat was now loaded down to the water's edge. He would gladly have let Alice remain, had there appeared any chance of returning in time, for he would have gained several minutes by so doing, for if the boat had been lighter he could have made better time. As it was he did not dare to risk it, for it seemed like dooming Alice to destruction needlessly. But oh, the horror of leaving Isabel when perhaps she would be washed away by the fast rising tide before he could return. This thought had also decided him to take Alice, for should Isabel be washed off he might be able to save her, but how could he hope to save two in such untoward circumstances.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Courage Miss Leicester," and the boat seemed to fly through the water with each vigorous stroke; his face wore an expression of intense anxiety as he bent to his oars. No words passed his firmly compressed lips after they left the reef, but his contracted brow and heavy breathing revealed how deeply he was suffering. In an incredibly short time they reached the beach, and Everard landed them in a very unceremonies manner, and then started once more for the rock. Notwithstanding all the exertion he had undergone, his face was as pale as death, and the cold damp stood upon his brow. There was an air of determination about him as he sprang back into the boat, that convinced Emily that he would save Isabel or perish in the attempt, and from that day she was master of his secret, but like a dear good sister as she was, she kept it in her kind little heart, though she sometimes built castles in the air.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Knowing now the proper course to take, Everard propelled the boat with marvellous rapidity, it skimmed over the water like an ocean bird, at least so Rose said; yet when he reached the reef, every part on which it was possible to stand was covered with water, and it was with the greatest difficulty that Isabel contrived to cling to a pointed piece of rock which still remained above water, nor could she have done so much longer, as her strength was fast failing. It seemed to Isabel wondrous strange, that she should feel so anxious to be rescued from her perilous situation, when not so long ago she had been so desirous of death, but so it was.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It was no easy matter to get the boat to this point, and had it required any more water to float it, it would have been impossible. As soon as Isabel was in the boat a joyful shout was raised by the party on shore. The return to land was slow, as the great exertion he had been forced to use was beginning to tell upon Everard. Of course Isabel was soaking wet, but fortunately a large plaid that Norris had made them take with them had been left on the beach; this they wrapt round her, and then went home as quickly as might be.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Mercy on us," exclaimed Norris, as they made their appearance, "what in the name of wonder have you been doing."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Why getting a soaking don't you see," returned Isabel, much amused at Norris's manner.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Then you will just get to bed right away Miss Leicester, for I would like to know how I am to answer to my Misses and Dr. Heathfield, if you get the consumption through your nonsense, dear me, and you were looking so well."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But Norris, if I change these wet things surely that will do."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You just get to bed, I say, for you are in my charge."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Everard laughed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Now Mr. Everard don't you be a interfering."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, certainly not."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Now come along at once Miss Leicester, and I will get you some hot gruel." Isabel did as she was bid, not wishing to vex Norris who had been very kind, but she protested against the gruel, but in vain, Norris made her swallow a large basin full, which to Isabel's intense disgust had a plentiful supply of brandy in it. After this Norris consented to hear the history of their adventures, which was told by the whole five at once.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "The air of D---- seems to have done wonders," said Everard when Isabel made her appearance at breakfast next morning looking quite her former self.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Yes indeed," returned Isabel with a pleasant smile, "how very stupid you must have thought us yesterday, I can't imagine how we could have been so foolish."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I suppose that you were not aware that the reef would be covered as the tide rose."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh yes, we knew quite well."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well then, you were all awfully stupid, if you will excuse my saying so," returned Everard, "I gave you credit Miss Leicester for more prudence."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You may well be surprised," Isabel answered coloring, "I am afraid when Mrs. Arlington hears of it she will be of Lady Ashton's opinion, that I am not fit to have charge of her daughters."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Emily laughed.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Did she say that," said Everard, "it was very impertinent of her."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "She thinks herself a privileged person, you would be astonished I can tell you if you heard all that she said."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Do be quiet Emily," interrupted Isabel.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 But Emily kept giving provoking little hints all breakfast time, and even as they walked to church she let out little bits, until Isabel grew almost angry. Everard admired the church exceedingly, "that is just such a church as I would like," he said as they went home.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh Everard," exclaimed Emily, "a little bit of a church like that."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is not so small," he returned.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh well, I thought you were more ambitious, if I were a clergyman I should wish to preach to a crowded assembly in a very large city church, and make a sensation."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Emily!"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh don't look so grave."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "A man that would care about making a sensation, would not be fit to be a clergyman."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh Everard, I am sure it is only good clergymen that do make a sensation."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What do you call making a sensation?" he inquired.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Why, to have every body saying what a splendid preacher, and praising you up to the skies."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Of course every clergyman should aim to be a good preacher, but his sermon should be composed with the object of doing as much good as possible, the idea of getting praise by it should never enter his head."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Of course I know I never should have done for a parson, if I had been a man I should have been a----."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Lawyer," the children all shouted in a breath.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Or a midshipman," said Emily.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I wonder what Miss Leicester would have been," observed Rose.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "A doctor," said Emily, "I know she would have been a doctor, wouldn't you Isabel."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Isabel became scarlet, this was only a random suggestion, but it seemed so like the answer the children had given Emily, that it made her color painfully.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh what is the use of talking such nonsense," she replied, but her vivid color had given Emily a new idea; Isabel she whispered "do those pet letters come from a doctor," a shade passed over Isabel's face like a cloud over the sun, as the thought occured that she should get no more pet letters, as Emily chose to call them, for though she had so firmly resolved not to allow her thoughts to dwell upon the past, there were still times when she was painfully reminded of the happy days that would never return, not that she grieved for the loss of Louis, as he now stood revealed in his true character. She knew that it had been her own ideal Louis that she had loved, she had clothed him with virtue that he did not possess, and ascribed to him a nobleness of nature to which he was a stranger, and her bitter sorrow was that he should have proved so different to what she had believed him. She had already begun to think that, as he was what he was, it was all for the best, and even now she felt more of contempt than love regarding him, though nothing short of the offensive and aggravated circumstances that had taken place, could have served to quench such love as her's.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Isabel avoided giving an answer to Emily's question, by drawing attention to a beautiful yacht that was now making the harbor, this did for the time, but Emily had made enough by her venture to plague Isabel sufficiently about the doctor, so much so, that Everard took occasion when they two were walking in the shrubbery to remonstrate with his sister, "Emily," he said, "can't you see that Miss Leicester is really annoyed at your nonsense, and I think that it amounts to rudeness in such a case."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh she don't care about it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You are mistaken Emily."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, but it is such fun, I do so like to make her color up, she looks so pretty."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But when you see that it really annoys----."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "When I get into the spirit of the thing, I can't stop." interrupted Emily.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I know it," replied Everard gently, "and that is the reason that I mention it, otherwise the matter is too trivial to comment upon."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The tears stood in Emily's eyes, "I did not mean any harm," she said softly, for Everard had great influence, and the secret of this influence which he had acquired over all the family was, that he was gentle yet very firm.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I did not say that there was any harm, only you should learn to stop when you see that it annoys, and surely you might abstain from such nonsense on a Sunday, it is setting the children a bad example to say the least of it."&nbsp;
