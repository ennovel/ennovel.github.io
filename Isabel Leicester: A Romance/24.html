"I only just heard you were back." After they had conversed awhile, Louis said, "Pretty girl that governess your sisters have at Elm Grove; aye, only she is such a confounded flirt."</p> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I esteem Miss Leicester very highly," returned Everard, coldly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Take care, old fellow, for she is, without exception, the greatest coquette I ever came across. She always had crowds of admirers, many of whom she contrived to draw on until they came to 'the point,' and then laughed at them. By Jove she will make a fool of you, Everard, if you don't mind."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I assure you, Louis, that you are quite mistaken. Miss Leicester is quite a different person to what you imagine."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Ha! ha! so you may think, but I knew her intimately, and I must say that I was surprised that your mother should trust her young daughters to her care."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Be quiet, Louis; I think her as near perfection as possible."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well, they say that love is blind--stone blind, in this case, I should say. She must have played her game well, to deceive you so thoroughly."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I am not deceived, neither has she played any game," returned Everard, with warmth. "She gives me no encouragement whatever--very far from it."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh, that is her new dodge, is it? Beware of her; she is a most accomplished actress."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You are mistaken," replied Everard, indignantly, "you know some one else of the same name."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Not a bit of it, my dear fellow; I saw the young minx at Elm Grove, and knew her directly. 'Beautiful, but dangerous.' I know her well."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Everard's cheek flushed with anger. "Louis," said he, "I will not hear any one speak disrespectfully of Miss Leicester. I consider any insult offered to her as a personal affront; therefore, if we are to remain friends, you must say no more on that subject now or at any other time."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Louis saw by Everard's countenance that he was in earnest, so answered, "as you will. I have satisfied my conscience by warning you; of course I can do no more. Won't you dine with us to-day?"
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "No, really, I cannot possibly; I have no time to go anywhere."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Take care you don't work too hard, and have to give up altogether. You look as if you were overdoing it. Too much of a good thing is good for nothing, you know. Come when you can--if not to-day, I shall be always glad to see you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What object can he have in speaking thus of Isabel?" Everard asked himself when Louis was gone--his beautiful and beloved Isabel, the charm of his existence, yet the torture of his life--(for was it not torture to be forever dwelling on her perfections, only to come back to the same undeniable fact that she had refused him--that she either could not, or would not, be his)--and now to hear her, the personification of his own ideal, spoken of as an accomplished actress and deceitful coquette, was almost more than he could endure. Then he asked himself what he had gained by his constant and excessive study: had it caused him to forget her? no, he could not forget she seemed ever with him in all her beauty, gentleness, and truth. He would win her yet, he told himself, and then owned he was a fool to indulge such thoughts, and determined to study harder still than ever, to prevent the possibility of his thoughts recurring so often to Isabel. Nevertheless, he would believe nothing against her--nothing.
