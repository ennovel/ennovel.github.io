<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Why not, I should like to know," interposed Louis, "it is a beautiful day and will do her good, I can't see how it is that you always set your face against her going out."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh but Louis, you know she has a bad cold."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Well it will do her cold good, I can't think where you got the idea, that going out is bad for a cold. Take her out Sarah."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "But Louis I'm afraid it will rain."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Rain, nonsense, what are you dreaming of this bright morning, take her out by all means Sarah, it will do her good."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Natalie gazed uneasily at the dark storm cloud in the horizon and was anything but satisfied.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Why Natie you look as sober as a judge" said Louis as he rose to go on his morning calls, "looking out for rain eh, don't be alarmed baby is not sugar nor salt."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 The careless gaiety of his tone jarred unpleasantly with her anxious fears for her darling, and she sighed as she looked pensively out upon the bright landscape, with another sigh she left the window and went about her various duties, about an hour after this, Natalie was startled by a vivid flash of lightning, and deafening peal of thunder; down came the rain in torrents, oh where is baby? how anxiously she watched, peering down the street from the front door, but no sign of Izzie, and how cold the air has turned. She orders a fire to be made in the nursery, and waits impatiently for baby's return. She comes at last, "oh my baby!" Natalie exclaims as she takes in her arms the dripping child, wet to the skin, and white as a sheet, every bit of clothing soaked, saturated. Natalie can not restrain her tears as she removes them, and warms the child before the bright fire, "oh my baby, my baby, my poor little Izzie," she murmured passionately, as she soothed and caressed her pet. Baby was happy now in her fresh clothes, and nestled cosily to her mother. After the thunder shower the weather cleared and all seemed bright and joyous without, but Natalie's heart was heavy, she was still very uneasy about the child, Louis was detained from home the entire day. At night baby became so oppressed in her breathing that Natalie was quite alarmed, oh how anxiously did she listen for Louis return, as she knelt by the child's cot in agony watching her intently.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh if he would but come, why, why, did he send her out. Oh the agony, waiting, watching, yes that is his step at last, she sends message after message, but he comes not, he will come when he has had his dinner she is told. It wrings her heart to leave her darling, even for a moment, but it must be done. Softly she glides to where he sits, and laying her trembling hand upon his arm, says in a husky voice "Louis come now, do not wait a moment longer--baby has the croup" in an instant he was at baby's side.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Natalie's ashy face and the word croup, acted like a talisman.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 It was croup, and a very bad attack too, he speedily did what was needful, but not without almost breaking his poor little wife's heart, by his cruel remarks, "you should be more careful of her," he said angrily "ten minutes more, and I could have done nothing for her."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh Louis," (he had been home now nearly a quarter of an hour.)
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "There must have been some gross mismanagement and fearful neglect, to bring on such an attack as this, to a child that has never been subject to croup, how she ever got into this state passes my understanding, you have been trying some of you foolish schemes I suppose."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh Louis, you know she was out in all that rain to-day" interposed Natalie meekly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "What was that for, I should like to know," he asked indignantly "are you tired of her already that you don't take better care of her than that?--Oh Natalie!" Natalie's pale cheek flushed at his injustice, but she made no answer, she only watched little Izzie in fear and trembling, and oh how glad and thankful she was when baby presently was sleeping quietly. But how often afterwards did she dwell upon these cruel words, and shed many bitter tears beside her sleeping darling's cot, oh baby, she would murmur, what more care could I take of you than I always do.
