Now the wished for moment has come, what a delightful stir and confusion it has occasioned. Rose is in ecstasy, and Amy wild with glee, even the quiet Alice seemed to have caught the infection. It was to be a regular old fashioned Xmas. Eve. All sorts of games and odd things, snap dragon, charades (for which Harry and Lucy were famous) magic music, dancing, and even blindmans buff was proposed but was over-ruled by the quieter members of the party. 'Santa Claus' sent a bountiful supply of presents down the chimney that night, which caused great merriment next day. For ladies got smoking caps, and cigar-cases; while gentlemen received workboxes, thimbles, and tatting-needles. Peter got a jester's cap and bells, which he vowed was a dunce's cap intended for Rose, to that young lady's great indignation. Tom had a primer, and a present for a good boy, and May received a plain gold ring at which they all laughed very much, to May's excessive annoyance. After breakfast they all went to church, and then all who chose went to see the school children, who were enjoying themselves immensely over their Xmas. fare. Then the sleighs were had out for a glorious drive over the frozen snow, but Isabel refused to join the party, preferring to stay quietly at home. To practise anthem's with Everard, Grace said. Isabel had no such idea, but for all that they did sing some anthems with the children, as Everard, who had taken a very active part in the arrangements for the Sunday School feast, was not of course one of the sleighing party, and returned some time before them. The children sang very nicely, doing great credit to Isabel's teaching, for which she was highly complimented by Everard.</p>

 "They ought to be much obliged to you, as they bid fair to surpass both Grace and Emily," he said.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Pray don't let Miss Arlington hear you say so, or she will never forgive me."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh never fear, she would not believe it, but I will be careful, as she is already dreadfully jealous of you."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Of me, how can she be, why should she."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "She has cause enough," he replied warmly, "but she should be more magnanimous."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't think it possible, I cannot imagine she could be so silly."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "It is plain enough to me, that she is."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I don't see it, I confess."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;

 "'Where ignorance is bliss,' he replied, with one of his usual penetrating glances. "Yours must be a very happily constituted mind to be so unconscious of all things disagreeable."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Not quite so unconscious as you imagine, but I advise you not to fish into troubled waters."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Still waters run deep, you mean," he replied.

 "Unfathomable," she said, and followed the children to the dining-room, for they had gone there to see if the decorations were completed. A right merry party sat down to dinner, sixty in number, all relations or old friends. Here is Tom's description of the wedding nest day, which he sent his friend:
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;DEAR DICK,--We are having jolly times here--rare fun on Christmas-eve, I assure you. But the best of all was my brother's wedding; eight bridesmaids, all as beautiful as sunshine. (I was a best-man, of course.) The bride looked magnificent--(between you and I, Dick, he has made a very good choice)--the rain and sunshine style. I can't say I understand that kind of thing, but on such occasions it tells immensely. (I admire one of the bridesmaids amazingly, but mum's the word, mind.) But to speak of the wedding. Governor Arlington is a liberal old fellow. Champagne like water, and everything to match.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Your's truly, T. M.&nbsp;
</div> 
<div>

 Elm Grove was scarcely the same place to Isabel when Emily was gone. She toiled on diligently with the children, but she found teaching anything but pleasant. Often after a tedious day, when tired and weary, she would gladly have laid down to rest her aching head and throbbing temples. Mrs. Arlington would request that she would join them in the drawing-room. Isabel did not consider herself at liberty to refuse, besides she did not wish to encounter Mrs. Arlington's frowns next day; and even when they were out, and she congratulated herself upon being left in peace, Mr. Arlington (who seldom accompanied hem) would ask her to sing some songs, or play a game of chess, and of course she had to comply. This kind of life was very irksome to Isabel--so different to what she had been accustomed to. She strove bravely with her fate, but in spite of all her endeavors she often cried herself to sleep she felt so desolate and alone. She had no home: there was no hearth where she was missed, or her coming anxiously looked for. Then she would grieve bitterly over the bright home she had lost, and the happy days gone, it seemed, for ever; and then in the morning be angry with herself for her ingratitude, remembering the blessings she still enjoyed, and how much worse off she might be, and strive to be contented. A fresh cause for disquietude arose, Grace evidently was jealous of her. Grace was handsome, but she was aware that Isabel was more attractive. Grace sang well, but she also knew that Isabel sang better, her voice was richer, fuller, more melodious. She said that Isabel always wanted to show off, and would look very incredulous and neutral when Isabel's performances were praised. One gentleman in particular was very enthusiastic in his praises. "But professional people are different you know," returned Grace.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh indeed, I was not aware that Miss Leicester was a professional singer," he replied.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Not a professional singer, she teaches singing," said Grace thinking she was going a little too far.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Indeed, where did you make her acquaintance, may I ask, you seldom hear such a splendid voice."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "Oh she is our governess," replied Grace.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 Turning to Isabel he said "you have a very fine voice Miss Leicester, if you were to make your debut at one of our best operas, you would make your fortune."
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I have no such idea," said Isabel, the indignant tears starting to her eyes, "that is the last thing I should thing of doing, she added with a reproachful look at Grace," but Grace seemed to be enjoying the whole thing amazingly.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "I do not suppose that you have thought of it or you certainly would not be a governess, with such a career open to you; with very little training you might command almost any salary." Isabel was excessively annoyed. "I assure you my dear young lady that it is worth your consideration he continued.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You mean well, no doubt, Mr. Bandolf, and I thank you for your kind intentions; but the matter requires no consideration, I could not entertain the idea for a moment" returned Isabel, and bowing coldly opened a book of prints.
</div> 
<div>
 &nbsp;
</div> 
<div>
 "You should not let pride prevent your worldly advancement," he added, which only made her more angry than ever. For all this I have to thank Miss Arlington she thought, and her feelings toward that young lady, at that moment, were not the most charitable.&nbsp;
