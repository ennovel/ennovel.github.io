It was much pleasanter to think of Henry Crawford than of their father; and to think of their father in England again within a certain period, which these letters obliged them to do, was a most unwelcome exercise.</p> 
<p>November was the black month fixed for his return. Sir Thomas wrote of it with as much decision as experience and anxiety could authorise. His business was so nearly concluded as to justify him in proposing to take his passage in the September packet, and he consequently looked forward with the hope of being with his beloved family again early in November.</p> 
<p>Maria was more to be pitied than Julia; for to her the father brought a husband, and the return of the friend most solicitous for her happiness would unite her to the lover, on whom she had chosen that happiness should depend. It was a gloomy prospect, and all she could do was to throw a mist over it, and hope when the mist cleared away she should see something else. It would hardly be _early_ in November, there were generally delays, a bad passage or _something_; that favouring _something_ which everybody who shuts their eyes while they look, or their understandings while they reason, feels the comfort of. It would probably be the middle of November at least; the middle of November was three months off. Three months comprised thirteen weeks. Much might happen in thirteen weeks.</p> 
<p>Sir Thomas would have been deeply mortified by a suspicion of half that his daughters felt on the subject of his return, and would hardly have found consolation in a knowledge of the interest it excited in the breast of another young lady. Miss Crawford, on walking up with her brother to spend the evening at Mansfield Park, heard the good news; and though seeming to have no concern in the affair beyond politeness, and to have vented all her feelings in a quiet congratulation, heard it with an attention not so easily satisfied. Mrs. Norris gave the particulars of the letters, and the subject was dropt; but after tea, as Miss Crawford was standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny looking out on a twilight scene, while the Miss Bertrams, Mr. Rushworth, and Henry Crawford were all busy with candles at the pianoforte, she suddenly revived it by turning round towards the group, and saying, "How happy Mr. Rushworth looks! He is thinking of November."</p> 
<p>Edmund looked round at Mr. Rushworth too, but had nothing to say.</p> 
<p>"Your father's return will be a very interesting event."</p> 
<p>"It will, indeed, after such an absence; an absence not only long, but including so many dangers."</p> 
<p>"It will be the forerunner also of other interesting events: your sister's marriage, and your taking orders."</p> 
<p>"Yes."</p> 
<p>"Don't be affronted," said she, laughing, "but it does put me in mind of some of the old heathen heroes, who, after performing great exploits in a foreign land, offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe return."</p> 
<p>"There is no sacrifice in the case," replied Edmund, with a serious smile, and glancing at the pianoforte again; "it is entirely her own doing."</p> 
<p>"Oh yes I know it is. I was merely joking. She has done no more than what every young woman would do; and I have no doubt of her being extremely happy. My other sacrifice, of course, you do not understand."</p> 
<p>"My taking orders, I assure you, is quite as voluntary as Maria's marrying."</p> 
<p>"It is fortunate that your inclination and your father's convenience should accord so well. There is a very good living kept for you, I understand, hereabouts."</p> 
<p>"Which you suppose has biassed me?"</p> 
<p>"But _that_ I am sure it has not," cried Fanny.</p> 
<p>"Thank you for your good word, Fanny, but it is more than I would affirm myself. On the contrary, the knowing that there was such a provision for me probably did bias me. Nor can I think it wrong that it should. There was no natural disinclination to be overcome, and I see no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he will have a competence early in life. I was in safe hands. I hope I should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way, and I am sure my father was too conscientious to have allowed it. I have no doubt that I was biased, but I think it was blamelessly."</p> 
<p>"It is the same sort of thing," said Fanny, after a short pause, "as for the son of an admiral to go into the navy, or the son of a general to be in the army, and nobody sees anything wrong in that. Nobody wonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve them best, or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they appear."</p> 
<p>"No, my dear Miss Price, and for reasons good. The profession, either navy or army, is its own justification. It has everything in its favour: heroism, danger, bustle, fashion. Soldiers and sailors are always acceptable in society. Nobody can wonder that men are soldiers and sailors."</p> 
<p>"But the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of preferment may be fairly suspected, you think?" said Edmund. "To be justified in your eyes, he must do it in the most complete uncertainty of any provision."</p> 
<p>"What! take orders without a living! No; that is madness indeed; absolute madness."</p> 
<p>"Shall I ask you how the church is to be filled, if a man is neither to take orders with a living nor without? No; for you certainly would not know what to say. But I must beg some advantage to the clergyman from your own argument. As he cannot be influenced by those feelings which you rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in their choice of a profession, as heroism, and noise, and fashion, are all against him, he ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting sincerity or good intentions in the choice of his."</p> 
<p>"Oh! no doubt he is very sincere in preferring an income ready made, to the trouble of working for one; and has the best intentions of doing nothing all the rest of his days but eat, drink, and grow fat. It is indolence, Mr. Bertram, indeed. Indolence and love of ease; a want of all laudable ambition, of taste for good company, or of inclination to take the trouble of being agreeable, which make men clergymen. A clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish--read the newspaper, watch the weather, and quarrel with his wife. His curate does all the work, and the business of his own life is to dine."</p> 
<p>"There are such clergymen, no doubt, but I think they are not so common as to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming it their general character. I suspect that in this comprehensive and (may I say) commonplace censure, you are not judging from yourself, but from prejudiced persons, whose opinions you have been in the habit of hearing. It is impossible that your own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy. You can have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of men you condemn so conclusively. You are speaking what you have been told at your uncle's table."</p> 
<p>"I speak what appears to me the general opinion; and where an opinion is general, it is usually correct. Though _I_ have not seen much of the domestic lives of clergymen, it is seen by too many to leave any deficiency of information."</p> 
<p>"Where any one body of educated men, of whatever denomination, are condemned indiscriminately, there must be a deficiency of information, or (smiling) of something else. Your uncle, and his brother admirals, perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom, good or bad, they were always wishing away."</p> 
<p>"Poor William! He has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the Antwerp," was a tender apostrophe of Fanny's, very much to the purpose of her own feelings if not of the conversation.</p> 
<p>"I have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle," said Miss Crawford, "that I can hardly suppose-- and since you push me so hard, I must observe, that I am not entirely without the means of seeing what clergymen are, being at this present time the guest of my own brother, Dr. Grant. And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging to me, and though he is really a gentleman, and, I dare say, a good scholar and clever, and often preaches good sermons, and is very respectable, _I_ see him to be an indolent, selfish _bon_ _vivant_, who must have his palate consulted in everything; who will not stir a finger for the convenience of any one; and who, moreover, if the cook makes a blunder, is out of humour with his excellent wife. To own the truth, Henry and I were partly driven out this very evening by a disappointment about a green goose, which he could not get the better of. My poor sister was forced to stay and bear it."</p> 
<p>"I do not wonder at your disapprobation, upon my word. It is a great defect of temper, made worse by a very faulty habit of self-indulgence; and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to such feelings as yours. Fanny, it goes against us. We cannot attempt to defend Dr. Grant."</p> 
<p>"No," replied Fanny, "but we need not give up his profession for all that; because, whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen, he would have taken a--not a good temper into it; and as he must, either in the navy or army, have had a great many more people under his command than he has now, I think more would have been made unhappy by him as a sailor or soldier than as a clergyman. Besides, I cannot but suppose that whatever there may be to wish otherwise in Dr. Grant would have been in a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly profession, where he would have had less time and obligation-- where he might have escaped that knowledge of himself, the _frequency_, at least, of that knowledge which it is impossible he should escape as he is now. A man-- a sensible man like Dr. Grant, cannot be in the habit of teaching others their duty every week, cannot go to church twice every Sunday, and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he does, without being the better for it himself. It must make him think; and I have no doubt that he oftener endeavours to restrain himself than he would if he had been anything but a clergyman."</p> 
<p>"We cannot prove to the contrary, to be sure; but I wish you a better fate, Miss Price, than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness depends upon his own sermons; for though he may preach himself into a good-humour every Sunday, it will be bad enough to have him quarrelling about green geese from Monday morning till Saturday night."</p> 
<p>"I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny," said Edmund affectionately, "must be beyond the reach of any sermons."</p> 
<p>Fanny turned farther into the window; and Miss Crawford had only time to say, in a pleasant manner, "I fancy Miss Price has been more used to deserve praise than to hear it"; when, being earnestly invited by the Miss Bertrams to join in a glee, she tripped off to the instrument, leaving Edmund looking after her in an ecstasy of admiration of all her many virtues, from her obliging manners down to her light and graceful tread.</p> 
<p>"There goes good-humour, I am sure," said he presently. "There goes a temper which would never give pain! How well she walks! and how readily she falls in with the inclination of others! joining them the moment she is asked. What a pity," he added, after an instant's reflection, "that she should have been in such hands!"</p> 
<p>Fanny agreed to it, and had the pleasure of seeing him continue at the window with her, in spite of the expected glee; and of having his eyes soon turned, like hers, towards the scene without, where all that was solemn, and soothing, and lovely, appeared in the brilliancy of an unclouded night, and the contrast of the deep shade of the woods. Fanny spoke her feelings. "Here's harmony!" said she; "here's repose! Here's what may leave all painting and all music behind, and what poetry only can attempt to describe! Here's what may tranquillise every care, and lift the heart to rapture! When I look out on such a night as this, I feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world; and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of Nature were more attended to, and people were carried more out of themselves by contemplating such a scene."</p> 
<p>"I like to hear your enthusiasm, Fanny. It is a lovely night, and they are much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel, in some degree, as you do; who have not, at least, been given a taste for Nature in early life. They lose a great deal."</p> 
<p>"_You_ taught me to think and feel on the subject, cousin."</p> 
<p>"I had a very apt scholar. There's Arcturus looking very bright."</p> 
<p>"Yes, and the Bear. I wish I could see Cassiopeia."</p> 
<p>"We must go out on the lawn for that. Should you be afraid?"</p> 
<p>"Not in the least. It is a great while since we have had any star-gazing."</p> 
<p>"Yes; I do not know how it has happened." The glee began. "We will stay till this is finished, Fanny," said he, turning his back on the window; and as it advanced, she had the mortification of seeing him advance too, moving forward by gentle degrees towards the instrument, and when it ceased, he was close by the singers, among the most urgent in requesting to hear the glee again.</p> 
<p>Fanny sighed alone at the window till scolded away by Mrs. Norris's threats of catching cold.</p> 
<p>在索瑟顿度过的这一天，尽管有这样那样的不能令人满意之处，但对两位伯特伦小姐来说，比起尔后不久从安提瓜寄回曼斯菲尔德的那些信件来，却使她们心里觉得愉快得多。想念亨利-克劳福德比想念她们的父亲有意思得多。信上告诉她们，她们的父亲过一阵就要回到英国，这是让她们想起来最头痛的一件事。</p> 
<p>11月是个令人沮丧的月份，做父亲的决定在这个月份到家。托马斯爵士对此写得毫不含糊，只有老练而又归心似箭的人才会有这样的写法。他的事情眼看就要办完了，提出乘坐9月份的邮船回国是有正当理由的。因此，他也就盼着11月初能和亲爱的妻子儿女重新团聚。</p> 
<p>玛丽亚比朱莉娅更为可怜，因为父亲一回来她就得嫁人。父亲最关心她的幸福，回来后就会要她嫁给她原来为了她的幸福而选定的意中人。前景是暗淡的，她只能给它蒙上一层迷雾，希望迷雾消散之后，能出现另一番景象。父亲不大会是11月初回来，凡事总会有个耽搁，比如航行不顺利或是出点什么事。凡是不敢正视现实、不敢接受现实的人，都会幻想出点什么事来寻求慰藉。可能至少要到11月中旬，离现在还有三个月。三个月就有十三个星期。十三个星期可能发生很多事情。</p> 
<p>托马斯爵士要是知道一点点他的两位女儿对他回家一事的想法，定会伤透了心。他要是知道他回来的事在另一位小姐心里引起的关注，也不会感到安慰。克劳福德小姐和她哥哥晚上到曼斯菲尔德庄园来玩，听到了这个好消息。她虽说出于礼貌地问了问，并不显得多么关心，只是心平气和地表示一番祝贺，但却聚精会神一字不漏地听别人讲这件事。诺里斯太太把信的内容详详细细地告诉了大家，然后便抛开了这个话题。但是喝过茶以后，当克劳福德小姐和埃德蒙、范妮一起站在敞开的窗口观看黄昏景色，而两位伯特伦小姐、拉什沃思先生和亨利·克劳福德在钢琴旁边忙着点蜡烛的时候，她突然朝他们转过身来，重新捡起了这个话题，说道：“拉什沃思先生看样子多高兴啊！他在想11月份呢。”</p> 
<p>埃德蒙也转过头来望着拉什沃思先生，不过没说什么。</p> 
<p>“你父亲回来可是件大喜事。”</p> 
<p>“还真是件大喜事呢，都离家这么久了。不仅时间久，而且还担了那么多风险。”</p> 
<p>“这件喜事还会引出别的喜事来：你妹妹出嫁，你接受圣职。”</p> 
<p>“是的。”</p> 
<p>“说出来你可不要生气，”克劳福德小姐笑着说，“这件事真让我想起了一些异教英雄，他们在国外立了大功，平安回来后就奉献点牺牲品来祭神。”</p> 
<p>“这件事上没有什么牺牲品可言，”埃德蒙虽然一本正经但仍然面带笑容地答道，一边又向钢琴那边瞥了一眼，“那完全是她自己愿意。”</p> 
<p>“噢！是的，我知道她自己愿意。我只不过是开个玩笑。她没有超出一般年轻女子做事的分寸。我毫不怀疑她极其乐意。我说的另一桩牺牲你当然不理解。”</p> 
<p>“我可以向你保证，我去当牧师和玛丽亚要结婚一样，完全是出于自愿。”</p> 
<p>“幸好你的意愿和你父亲的需要恰好一致。我听说，这附近给你保留了一个收入很高的牧师职位。”</p> 
<p>“你认为我是因此才愿意当牧师的。”</p> 
<p>“我知道他绝不是为了这个原因，”范妮嚷道。</p> 
<p>“谢谢你的美言，范妮，不过我自己可不敢这么说。恰好相反，很可能正是因为我知道我会有这样一份生活保障，我才愿意当牧师的。我觉得这也不算错。再说也不存在什么天生的抵触情绪。如果说一个人由于知道自己早年会有一份不错的收入，从而就做不成一个好牧师，我看这是没有什么根据的。我掌握在可靠的人的手中。我想我并没有受到不良的影响，我认为我父亲非常认真负责，也不会让我受到不良的影响。我毫不怀疑我在这件事上是有个人考虑的，可我认为这是无可指摘的。”</p> 
<p>“这就像是，”稍顿了一会后，范妮说道，“海军将领的儿子要参加海军，陆军将领的儿子要参加陆军，谁也不能说这种事情有什么错的。他们想要选择亲朋最能帮得上忙的那一行，谁也不会对此感到奇怪，也不会认为他们干上这一行之后，并不像表面上装得那么认真。”</p> 
<p>“是的，亲爱的普莱斯小姐，从道理上说的确如此。就职业本身而言，不论是海军还是陆军，这样做是有道理的。这样的职业，从各方面看都受人敬仰：它需要大无畏的精神，要冒送命的危险，充满惊天动地的场面，还有威武雄壮的打扮。陆军和海军总是受到上流社会的欢迎。男子汉参加陆军和海军，谁也不会感到奇怪。”</p> 
<p>“可是一个男子汉由于明知要得到一份俸禄而去当牧师，他的动机就要受到怀疑，你是这样想的吧？”埃德蒙说。“在你看来，他要证明自己动机纯正，就必须在事前丝毫不知道是否有俸禄的情况下去当牧师。”</p> 
<p>“什么！没有俸禄去当牧师！不，那真是发疯，不折不扣的发疯！”</p> 
<p>“我是否可以问你一句：如果有俸禄不去当牧师，没俸禄也不去当牧师，那教会的牧师从哪里来呢？我还是不问为好，因为你肯定无法回答。不过，我想从你的论点来为牧师们做点辩护。由于牧师不受你所欣赏的那些引诱人们去参加海军、陆军的种种思想的影响，由于大无畏精神、惊天动地、威武雄壮都与他们无缘，他们在选择自己的职业时，其真诚与好意更不应该受到怀疑。”</p> 
<p>“噢！他们的确很真诚，宁愿要一份现成的收入，而不肯靠干活去挣一份收入。他们的确也是一片好意，今后一生就能无所事事，只要吃吃喝喝，长得肥肥胖胖。这实在是懒惰呀，伯特伦先生。懒惰，贪图安逸——没有雄心壮志，不喜欢结交上等人，不愿意尽力讨人喜欢，正是这些毛病使一些人当上了牧师。牧师无事可做，只会邋里邋遢，自私自利——读读报，看看天气，和妻子拌嘴吵架。所有的事务都由助理牧师来做，他自己的日常事务就是应邀赴宴。”</p> 
<p>“这样的牧师肯定有，可我认为人数并没有那么多，克劳福德小姐把这种现象视为牧师的通病是不恰当的。你把牧师全都说得一无是处，你这种陈腐的指责——请允许我这样说，我想不是你自己的看法，而是和抱有偏见的人在一起，听惯了他们的意见。你凭着自己的观察，不可能对牧师有多少了解。你这么无情地指责的这类人中，你直接认识的没有几个。你讲的这些话是在你叔叔的饭桌上听来的。”</p> 
<p>“我所说的话，我认为是大家的普遍看法，而大家的普遍看法通常是正确的。虽然我没怎么亲眼见识过牧师们的家庭生活，但很多人都亲眼见识过了，因此那些话不会毫无根据。”</p> 
<p>“任何一个有文化的人组成的团体，不管它属于哪个派别，如果有人不分青红皂白地认为它的每个人都很糟，他的话肯定有不可靠的地方，或者（笑了笑）有什么别的成分。你叔叔和他的将军同事们除随军牧师外，对牧师们的情况并不了解，而对随军牧师，不论是好是坏，概不欢迎。”</p> 
<p>“可怜的威廉！他可受到安特卫普号上的随军牧师的多方关照，”范妮深情地说，虽然与所谈话题无关，却是她真情的流露。</p> 
<p>“我才不喜欢听信我叔叔的意见呢，”克劳福德小姐说，“这叫我难以想象。既然你逼人太甚，我不得不说，我并非丝毫没有办法了解牧师是什么样的人，我眼下就在我姐夫格兰特博士家做客。虽然格兰特博士待我非常好，对我关怀备至，虽然他是个真正有教养的人，而且我敢说还是个知识渊博的学者，是个聪明人，布道往往很受欢迎，为人也很体面，可在我看来，他就是个懒惰、自私、养尊处优的人，凡事以吃喝为重，不肯帮别人一点点忙，而且，要是厨子没把饭做好，他就冲他那好得不得了的妻子发脾气。对你们实说了吧，亨利和我今晚在一定意义上是被逼出来的，因为一只鹅做嫩了，不合他的意，他就气个没完。我那可怜的姐姐不得不待在家里受气。”</p> 
<p>“说实语，我对你的不满并不感到奇怪。他在性情上有很大的缺陷，而自我放纵的不良习惯又使他的性情变得更坏。像你这种心地的人，眼见着姐姐受这样的气，心里一定不是滋味。范妮，我们不赞成这种行为。我们可不能为格兰特博士辩护。”</p> 
<p>“是不能，”范妮答道，“不过，我们不能因此就否定他这行职业。格兰特博士不管干哪一行，都会把他的坏脾气带到那一行去。他要是参加海军或陆军的话，他手下指挥的人肯定比现在多得多。我想，他当海军军官或陆军军官，会比他当牧师给更多的人带来不幸。再说，我只觉得，不论我们希望格兰特博士干的是别的哪一行，他在那紧张的世俗的行业里很有可能比现在还糟糕，因为那样一来，他就没有那么多时间和义务来反省自己——他就会逃避自我反省，至少会减少自我反省的次数，而现在他却逃避不掉。一个人——一个像格兰特博士这样有头脑的人，每个星期都在教育别人怎样做人，每个星期天都要做两次礼拜，和颜悦色地讲道，而且讲得那么好，他本人岂能不因此变得好一些。这肯定会让他有所思考。我深信，他当牧师比干哪一行都能多做些自我约束。”</p> 
<p>“当然我们无法证明相反的情况——不过我祝愿你的命运好一些，普莱斯小姐，不要做一个靠讲道才能变得和蔼些的人的妻子。这样的人虽然每个星期天可以借助讲道使自己和和气气，但从星期一上午到星期六晚上因为鹅肉做嫩了跟你争争吵吵，也就够糟糕的了。”</p> 
<p>“我想能常和范妮吵架的人，”埃德蒙亲切地说，“即使讲道也感化不了。”</p> 
<p>范妮转过脸去，探身窗外。克劳福德小姐带着快活的神态说道：“我想普莱斯小姐往往是值得受人称赞，却又不习惯于听人称赞自己。”她刚说完，两位伯特伦小姐便恳切地邀请她去参加三重唱，她轻快地向钢琴那儿走去，埃德蒙望着她的背影，揣摩着她的种种好处，从谦恭和悦的仪态到轻盈优美的步履，真让他心醉神迷。</p> 
<p>“我相信她一定是个好脾气，”埃德蒙随即说。“这样的脾气永远不会给人带来痛苦！她走起路来多优美呀！她接受别人的意愿多爽快呀！一叫她就过去了。真可惜，”他想了想又说，“她居然落在这样一些人的手里！”</p> 
<p>范妮同意他的说法。她感到高兴的是，他继续和她待在窗前，不去理会就要开始的三重唱，并且马上像她一样把目光转向窗外的景色。在清澈灿烂的夜空中，在浓黯的林荫的衬托下，一切都显得肃穆宜人，令人心旷神怡。范妮抒发起自己的情感来。“这景色多么和谐呀！”她说。“多么恬静啊！比什么图画、什么音乐都美，就连诗歌也难尽言其妙。它能让你忘掉人间的一切烦恼，使你的心乐不可支！每当这样的夜晚我临窗外眺的时候，我就觉得好像世界上既没有邪恶也没有忧伤。如果人们多留神大自然的崇高壮丽，多看看这样的景色而忘掉自我，邪恶和忧伤一定会减少。”</p> 
<p>“我喜欢听你抒发自己的激情，范妮。这是个令人心旷神怡的夜晚，那些没有像你那样受过一定熏陶的人——至少是那些在早年没有受过爱好自然的培育的人，是非常可怜的。他们失去了许多东西。”</p> 
<p>“表哥，是你培养了我这方面的思想情感。”</p> 
<p>“我教的这个学生非常聪明。那儿是大熊星，非常明亮。”</p> 
<p>“是的，还有大熊星。要是能看见仙后星就好了。”</p> 
<p>“那得到草坪上才能看到。你怕不怕？”</p> 
<p>“一点也不怕。我们好久没有观看星星了。’</p> 
<p>“是的，我也不知道是怎么回事。”三重唱开始了。“我们等她们唱完了再出去吧，范妮，”埃德蒙一边说，一边转过脸，背向窗户。范妮见他随着歌声在一点一点地朝钢琴那儿移动，心里感到一阵屈辱。等歌声停下时，埃德蒙已走到歌手跟前，跟大家一起热烈地要求她们再唱一遍。</p> 
<p>范妮一个人站在窗前叹息．直至诺里斯太太责备她当心着凉，她才离开。</p>
