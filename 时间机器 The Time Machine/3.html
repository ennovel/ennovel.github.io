There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of the ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of it's sound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday, but on Friday, when the putting together was nearly done, I found that one of the nickel bars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get remade; so that the thing was not complete until this morning. It was at ten o'clock to-day that the first of all Time Machines began its career. I gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put one more drop of oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the saddle. I suppose a suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at what will come next as I felt then. I took the starting lever in one hand and the stopping one in the other, pressed the first, and almost immediately the second. I seemed to reel; I felt a nightmare sensation of falling; and, looking round, I saw the laboratory exactly as before. Had anything happened? For a moment I suspected that my intellect had tricked me. Then I noted the clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it had stood at a minute or so past ten; now it was nearly half-past three!</p> 
<p>`I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both hands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went dark. Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing me, towards the garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket. I pressed the lever over to its extreme position. The night came like the turning out of a lamp, and in another moment came to-morrow. The laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter and ever fainter. To-morrow night came black, then day again, night again, day again, faster and faster still. An eddying murmur filled my ears, and a strange, dumb confusedness descended on my mind.</p> 
<p>`I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time travelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling exactly like that one has upon a switchback--of a helpless headlong motion! I felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent smash. As I put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a black wing. The dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me, and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it every minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed the laboratory had been destroyed and I had come into the open air. I had a dim impression of scaffolding, but I was already going too fast to be conscious of any moving things. The slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast for me. The twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively painful to the eye. Then, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the moon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full, and had a faint glimpse of the circling stars. Presently, as I went on, still gaining velocity, the palpitation of night and day merged into one continuous greyness; the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a splendid luminous color like that of early twilight; the jerking sun became a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter fluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and then a brighter circle flickering in the blue.</p> 
<p>`The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hill-side upon which this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me grey and dim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour, now brown, now green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away. I saw huge buildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams. The whole surface of the earth seemed changed--melting and flowing under my eyes. The little hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round faster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun belt swayed up and down, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or less, and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute; and minute by minute the white snow flashed across the world, and vanished, and was followed by the bright, brief green of spring.</p> 
<p>`The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked indeed a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable to account. But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a kind of madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At first I scarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but these new sensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my mind--a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dread--until at last they took complete possession of me. What strange developments of humanity, what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilization, I thought, might not appear when I came to look nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes! I saw great and splendid architecture rising about me, more massive than any buildings of our own time, and yet, as it seemed, built of glimmer and mist. I saw a richer green flow up the hill-side, and remain there, without any wintry intermission. Even through the veil of my confusion the earth seemed very fair. And so my mind came round to the business of stopping,</p> 
<p>`The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance in the space which I, or the machine, occupied. So long as I travelled at a high velocity through time, this scarcely mattered; I was, so to speak, attenuated--was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of intervening substances! But to come to a stop involved the jamming of myself, molecule by molecule, into whatever lay in my way; meant bringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemical reaction--possibly a far-reaching explosion --would result, and blow myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions--into the Unknown. This possibility had occurred to me again and again while I was making the machine; but then I had cheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk-- one of the risks a man has got to take! Now the risk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the same cheerful light. The fact is that insensibly, the absolute strangeness of everything, the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine, above all, the feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely upset my nerve. I told myself that I could never stop, and with a gust of petulance I resolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I lugged over the lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over, and I was flung headlong through the air.</p> 
<p>`There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have been stunned for a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me, and I was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine. Everything still seemed grey, but presently I remarked that the confusion in my ears was gone. I looked round me. I was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a garden, surrounded by rhododendron bushes, and I noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating of the hail-stones. The rebounding, dancing hail hung in a cloud over the machine, and drove along the ground like smoke. In a moment I was wet to the skin. "Fine hospitality," said I, "to a man who has travelled innumerable years to see you."</p> 
<p>`Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and looked round me. A colossal figure, carved apparently in some white stone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy downpour. But all else of the world was invisible.</p> 
<p>`My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail grew thinner, I saw the white figure more distinctly. It was very large, for a silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white marble, in shape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings, instead of being carried vertically at the sides, were spread so that it seemed to hover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of bronze, and was thick with verdigris. It chanced that the face was towards me; the sightless eyes seemed to watch me; there was the faint shadow of a smile on the lips. It was greatly weather-worn, and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease. I stood looking at it for a little space--half a minute, perhaps, or half an hour. It seemed to advance and to recede as the hail drove before it denser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from it for a moment and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and that the sky was lightening with the promise of the Sun.</p> 
<p>`I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full temerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me. What might appear when that hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn? What might not have happened to men? What if cruelty had grown into a common passion? What if in this interval the race had lost its manliness and had developed into something inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly powerful? I might seem some old-world savage animal, only the more dreadful and disgusting for our common likeness--a foul creature to be incontinently slain.</p> 
<p>`Already I saw other vast shapes--huge buildings with intricate parapets and tall columns, with a wooded hill-side dimly creeping in upon me through the lessening storm. I was seized with a panic fear. I turned frantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard to readjust it. As I did so the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm. The grey downpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailing garments of a ghost. Above me, in the intense blue of the summer sky, some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness. The great buildings about me stood out clear and distinct, shining with the wet of the thunderstorm, and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses. I felt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps a bird may feel in the clear air, knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop. My fear grew to frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth, and again grappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gave under my desperate onset and turned over. It struck my chin violently. One hand on the saddle, the other on the lever, I stood panting heavily in attitude to mount again.</p> 
<p>`But with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. I looked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote future. In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the nearer house, I saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes. They had seen me, and their faces were directed towards me.</p> 
<p>`Then I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by the White Sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running. One of these emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which I stood with my machine. He was a slight creature--perhaps four feet high--clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a leather belt. Sandals or buskins--I could not clearly distinguish which--were on his feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his head was bare. Noticing that, I noticed for the first time how warm the air was.</p> 
<p>`He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but indescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful kind of consumptive--that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so much. At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence. I took my hands from the machine.</p> 
<p>“上星期四我对你们中的一些人讲过时间旅行机的工作原理，还带你们参观了车间里那架尚未完工的机器实体。机器现在就在那里，旅行后确实已有点破损，一根象牙棒裂开了，一根铜横杆也弯了，但其余部分完好无损。我原指望上星期五能完工，可星期五组装即将结束时，我发现一根镍棒整整短了1英寸，只得重做一根。因此，整台机器直到今天上午才告完成。我的第一架时间机器是今天10点钟开始旅程的。最后我拍拍机器，拧紧所有的螺丝，又在石英杆上加了一滴油，然后坐上鞍座。我想，我当时就像一个举枪对着脑袋想自杀的人，不知道接下去会发生什么。我一手握住启动杯，另一只手模着制动杆，先按了按启动杆，随即又按了按制动杆。我好像感到头晕目眩，像是在恶梦中坠入深渊。我朝四周张望，实验室和原来没有两样。难道发生了什么事？我马上怀疑是自己的脑袋一时糊涂，这时我注意到了钟，刚才好像还指在10点1分的地方，可现在都快3点半了！</p> 
<p>“我吸足一口气，咬紧牙，双手猛抓启动杆，机器“砰”的一声出发了。实验室里雾气腾腾，黑了下来。瓦切特夫人走进来，朝花园的门走去，显然她没有看见我。我想她走过去该用一分钟左右的时间，可我觉得她好像是火箭般穿过房间的。我把启动杆推到底，夜幕像熄灯似的突然降临了，再一转眼，已到了明天。实验室一片昏暗，雾气弥漫，接着越来越暗。明晚的黑夜来临了，接着又是白天，黑夜白天，越变越快。机器旋转的嗡嗡声震耳欲聋，一种奇怪而又莫名的慌乱感爬上我的心头。</p> 
<p>“恐怕我无法表达时间旅行中的种种奇怪感受。那是极其令人难受的，就像人们在环滑车上——只得听天由命，一直朝前冲！我也有那种自己马上就要粉身碎骨的预感。我加速后，昼夜的交替快得像一只黑翅膀在拍打。模糊不清的实验室好像立刻就要离我而去。我看见太阳快速跳过天空，每隔1分钟跳一下，每分钟标志着新的一天。我想实验室肯定给毁了，我已进入露天。我好像隐隐约约见到了脚手架，可我的速度已经太快，无法看清移动中的物体，连行动最慢的蜗牛也在我眼前一晃而过。黑暗与亮光的飞速交替使我眼痛难忍，在时断时续的黑暗中，我看见月亮飞转，穿梭似地由缺变圆，我还恍惚看到了旋转的星星。我继续前行，速度还在加快，昼夜的跳动很快变成了一片不变的灰色，天空呈现出迷人的深蓝色，犹如黎明时分的灿烂光辉。暮然升起的太阳在空中划出一道火光，一座辉煌的拱门，月亮也变成了一条暗淡的飘带。我没有看到什么星星，只是看到蓝天里不时出现一道明亮的光环。</p> 
<p>“景色朦朦胧胧看不清楚。我还在这所房子坐落的山腰上。山峰高耸在我上面，灰蒙蒙的，模糊不清。我看见树木的生长和变化像一团团雾气，时黄时翠。它们成长、伸展、凋零、枯萎。我看见巨大的建筑物拔地而起，影影绰绰，又像梦幻似地一掠而过。地球的整个表面好像都变了——一切都在我的眼前溶化流动。刻度盘上记录我速度的小指针越走越快，我立刻注意到太阳形成的火光带晃来晃去，不过一分钟时间已从一个季节晃到了另一个季节。因此，我的节奏已高达每分钟走过一年的速度。时间一分钟一分钟在过去，白雪掠过大地又消失了，接遗而来的是明媚而短暂的春天。</p> 
<p>“开始时那种难受的感觉现在不那么强烈了，它最终变成了一种歇斯底里的喜悦。我的确感到了机器笨拙的摇晃，不知道这是什么缘故。可我脑子昏沉沉的，哪有心思去多管。就这样，我怀着越来越狂乱的心情直冲未来。起先，我几乎没想到要停下来，只是想着这些新奇的感受，其他什么也不想。但是别的新印象也随即在我心中出现了——一种好奇心和随之而来的恐惧——最后它们完全控制了我。难以捉摸的朦胧世界在我眼前掠过，此起彼伏。要是我走近去看这个世界，我想，人类无数奇特的成就和我们原始文明的伟大前景都不可能在眼前出现。我看到宏伟的建筑在我身边升起，比我们自己时代的任何建筑还要壮观，可它们仿佛是建筑在虚无缥缈中的海市蜃楼。我看见一片比刚才更浓的绿色涌上山腰，停留在那里，郁郁葱葱，丝毫没有冬日的侵扰。即便我的双眼被美丽的风景迷惑了，可地球在我看来似乎仍然无限美好。于是我想到要停下来。</p> 
<p>“停下来的特别危险是，我可能会发现我或者时间机器所占的空间里已经有东西存在。只要我高速穿越时间，这就无关紧要了。换句话说，我变得稀薄了，像水蒸气一样在纵横交错的物质空隙间游动！但停下来就会把我的一个个分子撞在挡我路的东西上，也就是说使我的原子同障碍物的原子发生紧密接触，以致产生庞大的化学反应——可能是一次大爆炸——把我和我的机器炸到九霄云外，炸进未知世界。制造这台机器时，我常常想到这种可能性，可我欣然接受了这种可能性，认为它是不可避免的危险，是人们不得不冒的危险！现在这危险已无法避免，我的心情也不再乐观。事实上，这绝对不可捉摸的一句，机器的噪声和摇晃，尤其是长时间下坠的感觉已弄得我心慌意乱。我告诫自己决不能停下来，可一气之下我又决定立即停下来。我像个不耐烦的傻瓜，狠拉操纵杆，机器顿时飞转起来，把我双脚朝天摔了出去。</p> 
<p>“耳边传来一声巨响，我可能被惊了一下。无情的冰雹在我周围嘶嘶作响，我发现自己坐在翻倒的机器前的一片软草地上。一切东西似乎仍旧是灰色的，可我立刻发现耳边的轰鸣声消失了。我看看四周，觉得自己好像是在一个花园里的一小块草坪上，草坪周围全是杜鹃花。我发现终紫色的杜鹃花在冰雹的吹打下纷纷落下。跳动的冰雹挂在机器上空的云中，像一团烟雾掠过大地。转眼功夫，我已浑身湿透，‘这对一位走过无数岁月前来看你的人’，我说，‘真够殷勤的！’</p> 
<p>“我立即想到这样让自己淋湿真是太傻了。我站起身环视四周，雾蒙蒙的风雨里，一座显然是用白色石头雕成的塑像依稀矗立在杜鹃花后面。除此之外，什么也看不见了。</p> 
<p>“我的感受很难描述。冰雹渐稀后，白色塑像看得更清楚了。塑像很高，一棵白桦树才接到它的肩膀处。塑像是用大理石雕的，样子有点像长着翅膀的斯芬克斯，不过它两旁的翅膀没有垂着，而是伸展着的，好像在翱翔。据我看，底座是青铜铸的，上面已生了厚厚一层铜绿。塑像的脸正巧面对着我，两只根本看不见的眼睛好像在注视我，嘴角挂着淡淡的微笑。塑像饱经风吹雨打，显露出一副叫人难受的病态。我站在那里打量了一会儿——半分钟，或许是半小时。雕像随着冰雹的疏密好像在前移和后退。最后我朝别处看去，只见雹幕绽裂，天空放晴，太阳就要出来了。</p> 
<p>“我再次仰望蹲伏着的白色塑像，突然觉得我的这次旅行非常草率。这雾蒙蒙的天幕拉开后会出现什么呢？这时的人会怎么样呢？要是大家都残忍成性会怎么样呢？人类这个种族要是在这段时间里已失去人性，变成了非人，变得冷酷无情、凶猛无比，这又会怎么样呢？我也许会变得像古老世界的一只野兽，只会比它们更加可怕和可憎——像一只该立即宰杀的畜生。</p> 
<p>“我看到了别的庞然大物——栏杆交错、立柱高耸的巨大建筑穿过就要停息的风雨，和林木茂密的山腰一道朝我悄悄爬来。我感到一阵惊恐，猛然转身，跑到时间机器旁边，竭力想把它翻正过来。就在这时，阳光穿破了雨幕，灰蒙蒙的雷雨被驱赶到一边，像魔鬼的长袍一样消失了。头顶上，几丝淡褐色的云彩跑得无影无踪。矗立在我周围的巨大建筑清晰地突现出来，在雨后的阳光下闪烁，尚未溶化的冰雹把它们衬托得更加洁白耀眼。我感到自己在这个陌生的世界里无依无靠，也许就像一只晴空中的小鸟，知道老鹰在盘旋，随时都会扑下来。我的恐惧慢慢变成了疯狂。我吸了一口气，咬紧牙关，连手带脚，再次全力扳动机器。机器终于抵挡不住，翻过身来，还在我的下巴上重重地打了一下。我一手抓鞍座，一手抓杠杆，气喘吁吁地摆好了再次登上机器的架势。</p> 
<p>“但当我从仓碎撤退中清醒过来的同时，我的勇气也恢复了。我更加好奇而又无所畏惧地望着这个遥远未来的世界。我看见不远处一幢房子的高墙上的一个圆门里，有一群身穿华丽软袍的人，他们也看见了我，一个个朝我这边张望。</p> 
<p>“接着我听见有声音传来，只见白色斯芬克斯像边的树丛里人头攒动，许多男人在奔跑，其中一个出现在一条小路上，这条小路直通我和时间机器所在的那方小草坪。他是个弱小的家伙—一也许才4英尺高——身穿紫袍，腰里束了条皮带，脚上穿的是凉鞋还是靴子我看不清楚。他裸露着小腿，头上也没戴帽子。这时我才注意到天气是多么温暖。</p> 
<p>“他是个非常漂亮又文雅的人，可脆弱无比，这使我很吃惊。他那红润的面孔使我联想到更加漂亮的肺病患者——就是我们过去经常听说的那种肺病美人。看到他的这副模样，我突然又恢复了自信。我松开了抓着时间机器的双手。”</p>
