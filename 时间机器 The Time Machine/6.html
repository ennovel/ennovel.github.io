I felt a peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just the half-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in spirit in a zoological museum. And they were filthily cold to the touch. Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic influence of the Eloi, whose disgust of the Morlocks I now began to appreciate.</p> 
<p>`The next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a little disordered. I was oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Once or twice I had a feeling of intense fear for which I could perceive no definite reason. I remember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where the little people were sleeping in the moonlight--that night Weena was among them--and feeling reassured by their presence. It occurred to me even then, that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through its last quarter, and the nights grow dark, when the appearances of these unpleasant creatures from below, these whitened Lemurs, this new vermin that had replaced the old, might be more abundant. And on both these days I had the restless feeling of one who shirks an inevitable duty. I felt assured that the Time Machine was only to be recovered by boldly penetrating these underground mysteries. Yet I could not face the mystery. If only I had had a companion it would have been different. But I was so horribly alone, and even to clamber down into the darkness of the well appalled me. I don't know if you will understand my feeling, but I never felt quite safe at my back.</p> 
<p>`It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me further and further afield in my exploring expeditions. Going to the south-westward towards the rising country that is now called Combe Wood, I observed far off, in the direction of nineteenth-century Banstead, a vast green structure, different in character from any I had hitherto seen. It was larger than the largest of the palaces or ruins I knew, and the facade had an Oriental look: the face of it having the lustre, as well as the pale-green tint, a kind of bluish-green, of a certain type of Chinese porcelain. This difference in aspect suggested a difference in use, and I was minded to push on and explore. But the day was growing late, and I had come upon the sight of the place after a long and tiring circuit; so I resolved to hold over the adventure for the following day, and I returned to the welcome and the caresses of little Weena. But next morning I perceived clearly enough that my curiosity regarding the Palace of Green Porcelain was a piece of self-deception, to enable me to shirk, by another day, an experience I dreaded. I resolved I would make the descent without further waste of time, and started out in the early morning towards a well near the ruins of granite and aluminium.</p> 
<p>`Little Weena ran with me. She danced beside me to the well, but when she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward, she seemed strangely disconcerted. "Good-bye, Little Weena," I said, kissing her; and then putting her down, I began to feel over the parapet for the climbing hooks. Rather hastily, I may as well confess, for I feared my courage might leak away! At first she watched me in amazement. Then she gave a most piteous cry, and running to me, she began to pull at me with her little hands. I think her opposition nerved me rather to proceed. I shook her off, perhaps a little roughly, and in another moment I was in the throat of the well. I saw her agonized face over the parapet, and smiled to reassure her. Then I had to look down at the unstable hooks to which I clung.</p> 
<p>`I had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. The descent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from the sides of the well, and these being adapted to the needs of a creature much smaller and lighter than myself, I was speedily cramped and fatigued by the descent. And not simply fatigued! One of the bars bent suddenly under my weight, and almost swung me off into the blackness beneath. For a moment I hung by one hand, and after that experience I did not dare to rest again. Though my arms and back were presently acutely painful, I went on clambering down the sheer descent with as quick a motion as possible. Glancing upward, I saw the aperture, a small blue disk, in which a star was visible, while little Weena's head showed as a round black projection. The thudding sound of a machine below grew louder and more oppressive. Everything save that little disk above was profoundly dark, and when I looked up again Weena had disappeared.</p> 
<p>`I was in an agony of discomfort. I had some thought of trying to go up the shaft again, and leave the Under-world alone. But even while I turned this over in my mind I continued to descend. At last, with intense relief, I saw dimly coming up, a foot to the right of me, a slender loophole in the wall. Swinging myself in, I found it was the aperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which I could lie down and rest. It was not too soon. My arms ached, my back was cramped, and I was trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the unbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes. The air was full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the shaft.</p> 
<p>`I do not know how long I lay. I was roused by a soft hand touching my face. Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches and, hastily striking one, I saw three stooping white creatures similar to the one I had seen above ground in the ruin, hastily retreating before the light. Living, as they did, in what appeared to me impenetrable darkness, their eyes were abnormally large and sensitive, just as are the pupils of the abysmal fishes, and they reflected the light in the same way. I have no doubt they could see me in that rayless obscurity, and they did not seem to have any fear of me apart from the light. But, so soon as I struck a match in order to see them, they fled incontinently, vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels, from which their eyes glared at me in the strangest fashion.</p> 
<p>`I tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparently different from that of the Over-world people; so that I was needs left to my own unaided efforts, and the thought of flight before exploration was even then in my mind. But I said to myself, "You are in for it now," and, feeling my way along the tunnel, I found the noise of machinery grow louder. Presently the walls fell away from me, and I came to a large open space, and striking another match, saw that I had entered a vast arched cavern, which stretched into utter darkness beyond the range of my light. The view I had of it was as much as one could see in the burning of a match.</p> 
<p>`Necessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes like big machines rose out of the dimness, and cast grotesque black shadows, in which dim spectral Morlocks sheltered from the glare. The place, by the by, was very stuffy and oppressive, and the faint halitus of freshly shed blood was in the air. Some way down the central vista was a little table of white metal, laid with what seemed a meal. The Morlocks at any rate were carnivorous! Even at the time, I remember wondering what large animal could have survived to furnish the red joint I saw. It was all very indistinct: the heavy smell, the big unmeaning shapes, the obscene figures lurking in the shadows, and only waiting for the darkness to come at me again! Then the match burned down, and stung my fingers, and fell, a wriggling red spot in the blackness.</p> 
<p>`I have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for such an experience. When I had started with the Time Machine, I had started with the absurd assumption that the men of the Future would certainly be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances. I had come without arms, without medicine, without anything to smoke--at times I missed tobacco frightfully--even without enough matches. If only I had thought of a Kodak! I could have flashed that glimpse of the Underworld in a second, and examined it at leisure. But, as it was, I stood there with only the weapons and the powers that Nature had endowed me with--hands, feet, and teeth; these, and four safety-matches that still remained to me.</p> 
<p>`I was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the dark, and it was only with my last glimpse of light I discovered that my store of matches had run low. It had never occurred to me until that moment that there was any need to economize them, and I had wasted almost half the box in astonishing the Upper-worlders, to whom fire was a novelty. Now, as I say, I had four left, and while I stood in the dark, a hand touched mine, lank fingers came feeling over my face, and I was sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour. I fancied I heard the breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little beings about me. I felt the box of matches in my hand being gently disengaged, and other hands behind me plucking at my clothing. The sense of these unseen creatures examining me was indescribably unpleasant. The sudden realization of my ignorance of their ways of thinking and doing came home to me very vividly in the darkness. I shouted at them as loudly as I could. They started away, and then I could feel them approaching me again. They clutched at me more boldly, whispering odd sounds to each other. I shivered violently, and shouted again rather discordantly. This time they were not so seriously alarmed, and they made a queer laughing noise as they came back at me. I will confess I was horribly frightened. I determined to strike another match and escape under the protection of its glare. I did so, and eking out the flicker with a scrap of paper from my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrow tunnel. But I had scarce entered this when my light was blown out and in the blackness I could hear the Morlocks rustling like wind among leaves, and pattering like the rain, as they hurried after me.</p> 
<p>`In a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no mistaking that they were trying to haul me back. I struck another light, and waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarce imagine how nauseatingly inhuman they looked--those pale, chinless faces and great, lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!--as they stared in their blindness and bewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promise you: I retreated again, and when my second match had ended, I struck my third. It had almost burned through when I reached the opening into the shaft. I lay down on the edge, for the throb of the great pump below made me giddy. Then I felt sideways for the projecting hooks, and, as I did so, my feet were grasped from behind, and I was violently tugged backward. I lit my last match . . . and it incontinently went out. But I had my hand on the climbing bars now, and, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from the clutches of the Morlocks and was speedily clambering up the shaft, while they stayed peering and blinking up at me: all but one little wretch who followed me for some way, and wellnigh secured my boot as a trophy.</p> 
<p>`That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or thirty feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatest difficulty in keeping my hold. The last few yards was a frightful struggle against this faintness. Several times my head swam, and I felt all the sensations of falling. At last, however, I got over the well-mouth somehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight. I fell upon my face. Even the soil smelt sweet and clean. Then I remember Weena kissing my hands and ears, and the voices of others among the Eloi. Then, for a time, I was insensible.</p> 
<p>“听到这里，你们也许觉得很奇怪。但两天之后，我用分明是合适的方法跟踪了一条新发现的线索。这之前我看到那些苍白的躯体，总有一种特别的畏缩感，他们就像人们在动物展览馆里见到的泡在酒精里的蛆虫，呈半漂白色，摸上去冷冰冰的让人恶心。也许我的畏缩感主要是受埃洛伊人的影响，他们为什么厌恶莫洛克人我现在开始明白了。</p> 
<p>“接下来的那个晚上，我没有睡好。或许我的身体有点失调，困惑和疑虑压抑着我。有一两次我还产生了一种强烈的恐惧感，可又说不清到底害怕什么。记得月色下我悄然无声地爬进了那些小人睡觉的大厅，威娜那天晚上也在他们中间，看到他们全都平安无事我才放下心来。即使在那时，我还认为月亮再过几天便要隐去，夜晚将变得一片漆黑。这些地下的叫人讨厌的家伙，这些白色的狐猴，这替代了前辈的新一代害虫也许会更加兴旺昌盛。这两天，我像个想逃避不可推卸的责任的人，整天坐立不安。我感到肯定的是，只有勇敢地去揭穿这些地下之谜，我才能找回时间机器。可我又无法面对这地下之谜，要是我有个伴，事情就不至于这样。我孤零零一个人，连爬到黑乎乎的井下去都会让我胆战心惊。不知道你们能否理解我的心情，可我从未感到有什么安全的后盾。</p> 
<p>“也许正是这种不安，这种危险驱使我跑到越来越远的野外去开展我的探险工作。朝西南方向现在叫做库姆·伍德的这个正在蓬勃发展的乡村走，我看到远处19世纪班斯蒂特城的方向有一座绿色的大型建筑。它的特征和我迄今为止见到的任何建筑都不一样，比我知道的最大的宫殿和废墟还要大，它的正面具有东方情调：表面呈淡绿色，像中国瓷器上的那种蓝绿色并且富有光泽。这与众木同的样子表明它具有不同的用途。我决心继续探索下去，可天色越来越暗，我兜了个累人的大圈子才到了这里，于是决定把这探险工作推迟到第二天，我回到了欢迎我、安抚我的小威娜身边。可第二天早上，我发现我对青瓷殿表现出的好奇完全是自欺欺人，推迟一天其实是找个借口想再逃避一天我害怕的事。我决定不再浪费时间，立即下井，干是一大早就朝花岗岩和铝废墟附近的那口井出发了。</p> 
<p>“小威娜跟着我，一路蹦蹦跳跳来到井边，可见我俯身朝井下张望时，她显得特别担心。‘再见，小威娜，’我说着吻了她一下，随后我放下她。越过并栏杆去摸下井用的脚手钩。我得承认，我下井的动作相当快，因为我担心我的勇气会慢慢溜掉！她先是吃惊地望着我，然后发出一声令人哀怜的叫喊，冲过来用她的小手拉住我。这一拉更增强了我下井的勇气。我挣脱开她，动作可能粗鲁了点，转眼间我已下了井口。我看见她痛苦的脸靠在栏杆上，我朝她笑笑，让她放心。之后我只得低头望着我手里抓着的摇摇晃晃的钩子。</p> 
<p>“我大概要向井下爬二三百码。下井并不顺利，因为井壁上伸出来不少金属杆，这些金属杆是给比我轻得多的人使用的。所以我没爬多久就被挤得精疲力竭了。其实又何止精疲力竭！有一根金属杆因吃不住我的重量突然弯曲，差点把我摔到漆黑的井底下去。我一下子只剩单手吊着。自那之后我再也不敢歇下来了。尽管我的手臂和后背酸痛不止，我仍手脚不停，继续尽快地朝井下爬去。我抬头朝上看，只见井口像一只蓝色的小盘子，从小盘子里可以看到天上的一颗星星，小威娜伸出的头像一个圆黑影。井底下一台机器沉重地砰砰声越来越响，越来越叫人难受。除了头顶上那个小盘子一样的井口，周围黑得伸手不见五指。我再次抬头向上张望，威娜不在了。</p> 
<p>“我感到非常难过，甚至想到过再爬到井上去，不去管那地下世界了。但即便有这个念头时，我还是在往下爬，终于我隐约看到在右侧1英尺左右的壁上有一个狭长的小孔。我松了一口气，轻松地钻了进去，发现这是一个横向隧道的洞口，我可以在里面躺下来休息一下。没过多久，我的手臂疼痛，后背麻木，身体因害怕跌下去在瑟瑟发抖。此外，无边的黑暗使我的眼睛也酸痛起来。空中到处都能听到机器的震动声和在井下打气的砰砰声。</p> 
<p>“我不知道躺了多久。是一只碰到我脸的软绵绵的手把我惊醒的。我在黑暗中直跳起来，抓住火柴，赶忙划亮了一根。只见三个弯着腰的白家伙，样子就像我在地面上废墟里看到的那东西，他们见到亮光后迅速跑开了。由于他们生活在照我看是漆黑的环境里，他们的眼睛特别大而且非常敏感，犹如深水鱼的瞳孔，并且还能反光。我肯定他们在没有光线的昏暗中能够看到我，他们只是伯光，好像根本不怕我。可当我点亮一根火柴想看个究竟时，他们慌乱地跑进黑暗的隧道，躲在隧道里用奇特的方式盯着我。</p> 
<p>“我想朝他们喊话，可他们的语言显然和地上入的语言不一样。就这样，语言不通，我孤立无援，一切只得靠自己。下井前想逃跑的念头这时仍在脑海里索绕。我发现机器声越来越响。顷刻间洞壁不见了，我来到一块很大的空旷地。我又点了一根火柴，发现自己已进入一个拱形大洞，大洞一直沿伸到火柴光照不到的黑暗中。我所讲的只是在火柴光下看到的情景。</p> 
<p>“我的记忆肯定是模糊不清的。像大机器一样的庞然大物在黑暗中显露出来，投下了怪诞的黑影，鬼怪似的莫洛克人就在这黑影里躲避光照。顺便说一句，这地方很闷，呼吸困难，空气中弥漫着一股淡淡的血腥味。空地中间的地方有一张白色金属做的小桌子，上面摆的似乎是吃的东西。莫洛克人至少是食肉动物！记得即便那时我都在纳闷是什么大动物能够幸存下来，为他们提供我看到的那种红红的腿肉。这一切都是难以捉摸的，浓重的气味，呆板的庞然大物，伏在黑影里等着火柴一灭再次向我袭来的可憎的家伙。这时，我手中的火柴烧到根部烫了下手掉落下去，在黑暗中形成了一条扭动的红点。</p> 
<p>“我一直在想，进行这次历险所带的装备实在是太少了。我坐时间机器出发时，便荒唐地认为未来人在设备方面无疑远远走在我们前面，因此来时没带武器，没带药品，也没带任何烟具——有时真想抽烟——甚至连火柴都没带足。当时如果想到带架柯达相机该多好！我就可以在瞬间把地下世界的景色拍下来，以后有空时再细细研究。可是现在，我站在那里，只有大自然赋予我的武器和力量——手、脚、牙齿，外加4根剩下的安全火柴。</p> 
<p>“我在这黑暗中木敢走过这台大机器继续向前。我借着火光最后看清我的火柴已所剩无几。直到那时我才想起要节约火柴，另外，我吓唬地上人还浪费了半盒火柴，他们觉得很新鲜。我说过，现在我只剩4根火柴了。我站在黑暗中的时候，有一只手碰了下我，细长的手指摸到我的脸上，我闻到一股怪味。我听到了这群围在我周围的可怕的小东西的呼吸声。我感到有人在轻轻地从我手里拿走火柴盒，身后还有手在拉我的衣服。我感到这些我看不见的家伙正在观察我，我难受极了。我在黑暗中突然清晰地意识到我对他们的思维和办事方式一无所知。我拚命朝他们大声叫喊。他们吓得跑开了，接着我感到他们又靠了上来。他们紧紧抓住我，胆子更大了，相互还轻声说着什么。我浑身哆咦，又喊了起来，声音很难听。这次他们没有受到大惊吓，回到我身旁时还在怪笑。我承认自己倒吓了一大跳。我决定再划一根火柴，在光亮的保护下逃身。于是我点亮火柴，为了火光更加充足，还点燃了从口袋里掏出来的一张纸。然后，我赶紧朝狭窄的隧道里退去，可刚进隧道火就灭了。黑暗中我听到莫洛克人紧跟在后，像风吹树叶、雨滴落地似的沙沙作响。</p> 
<p>“我一下子被几只手拉住，无疑他们是想把我再拉回去。我又点亮一根火柴，在他们怕光的脑袋前挥舞。你们几乎无法想象他们人不人鬼不鬼的脸看上去多么叫人作呕——苍白而没有下巴的脸，还有茫然注视你时那又大又没有眼睑的红里泛灰的眼睛！可我没有停下来，我向你保证。我再次朝后退，第二根火柴烧完后，我点亮第三根。当我见到隧道的入井口时，手中的火柴已基本烧完。我在入口的边上躺了下来，因为井底下大泵的砰砰声震得我头昏眼花。随后我伸手到井壁上去摸凸出来的钩子。正摸着，我拖在后面的双脚被抓住了，我死命蹬脚，同时点亮最后一根火柴。……可它一下子灭了。但这时我已抓住攀登杆，我死命踢脚，终于从莫洛克人的手中挣脱出来，我迅速朝井上爬去。他们只得呆在下面望着我干瞪眼，只有一个小坏蛋跟在我身后爬了一阵子，差点没把我的靴子弄去当战利品。</p> 
<p>“我好像怎么也爬不到尽头，到最后二三十英尺时，我突然感到恶心得要命，简直连手都快抓不住了。最后几码可谓是我和昏沉沉的脑袋展开的一场可怕的较量，好几次我头晕目眩，感到自己跌了下去。然而，我终于爬到井口，摇摇晃晃走出废墟，来到刺眼的阳光里。我趴倒在地上，连泥土都像是清新芬芳的。我记得威娜过来亲吻我的手和耳朵，还听到了其他埃洛伊人的声音。之后我一度失去了知觉。”</p>
