Only ragged vestiges of glass remained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing had fallen away from the corroded metallic framework. It lay very high upon a turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I was surprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged Wandsworth and Battersea must once have been. I thought then--though I never followed up the thought--of what might have happened, or might be happening, to the living things in the sea.</p> 
<p>`The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed porcelain, and along the face of it I saw an inscription in some unknown character. I thought, rather foolishly, that Weena might help me to interpret this, but I only learned that the bare idea of writing had never entered her head. She always seemed to me, I fancy, more human than she was, perhaps because her affection was so human.</p> 
<p>`Within the big valves of the door--which were open and broken--we found, instead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by many side windows. At the first glance I was reminded of a museum. The tiled floor was thick with dust, and a remarkable array of miscellaneous objects was shrouded in the same grey covering. Then I perceived, standing strange and gaunt in the centre of the hall, what was clearly the lower part of a huge skeleton. I recognized by the oblique feet that it was some extinct creature after the fashion of the Megatherium. The skull and the upper bones lay beside it in the thick dust, and in one place, where rain-water had dropped through a leak in the roof, the thing itself had been worn away. Further in the gallery was the huge skeleton barrel of a Brontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going towards the side I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and clearing away the thick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of our own time. But they must have been air-tight to judge from the fair preservation of some of their contents.</p> 
<p>`Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South Kensington! Here, apparently, was the Palaeontological Section, and a very splendid array of fossils it must have been, though the inevitable process of decay that had been staved off for a time, and had, through the extinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine hundredths of its force, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness if with extreme slowness at work again upon all its treasures. Here and there I found traces of the little people in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces or threaded in strings upon reeds. And the cases had in some instances been bodily removed--by the Morlocks as I judged. The place was very silent. The thick dust deadened our footsteps. Weena, who had been rolling a sea urchin down the sloping glass of a case, presently came, as I stared about me, and very quietly took my hand and stood beside me.</p> 
<p>`And at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an intellectual age, that I gave no thought to the possibilities it presented. Even my preoccupation about the Time Machine receded a little from my mind.</p> 
<p>`To judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelain had a great deal more in it than a Gallery of Palaeontology; possibly historical galleries; it might be, even a library! To me, at least in my present circumstances, these would be vastly more interesting than this spectacle of oldtime geology in decay. Exploring, I found another short gallery running transversely to the first. This appeared to be devoted to minerals, and the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind running on gunpowder. But I could find no saltpeter; indeed, no nitrates of any kind. Doubtless they had deliquesced ages ago. Yet the sulphur hung in my mind, and set up a train of thinking. As for the rest of the contents of that gallery, though on the whole they were the best preserved of all I saw, I had little interest. I am no specialist in mineralogy, and I went on down a very ruinous aisle running parallel to the first hall I had entered. Apparently this section had been devoted to natural history, but everything had long since passed out of recognition. A few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once been stuffed animals, desiccated mummies in jars that had once held spirit, a brown dust of departed plants: that was all! I was sorry for that, because I should have been glad to trace the patent readjustments by which the conquest of animated nature had been attained. Then we came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but singularly ill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle from the end at which I entered. At intervals white globes hung from the ceiling--many of them cracked and smashed--which suggested that originally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more in my element, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of big machines, all greatly corroded and many broken down, but some still fairly complete. You know I have a certain weakness for mechanism, and I was inclined to linger among these; the more so as for the most part they had the interest of puzzles, and I could make only the vaguest guesses at what they were for. I fancied that if I could solve their puzzles I should find myself in possession of powers that might be of use against the Morlocks.</p> 
<p>`Suddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that she startled me. Had it not been for her I do not think I should have noticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all. (Footnote: It may be, of course, that the floor did not slope, but that the museum was built into the side of a hill.-ED.) The end I had come in at was quite above ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As you went down the length, the ground came up against these windows, until at last there was a pit like the "area" of a London house before each, and only a narrow line of daylight at the top. I went slowly along, puzzling about the machines, and had been too intent upon them to notice the gradual diminution of the light, until Weena's increasing apprehensions drew my attention. Then I saw that the gallery ran down at last into a thick darkness. I hesitated, and then, as I looked round me, I saw that the dust was less abundant and its surface less even. Further away towards the dimness, it appeared to be broken by a number of small narrow footprints. My sense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks revived at that. I felt that I was wasting my time in the academic examination of machinery. I called to mind that it was already far advanced in the afternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge, and no means of making a fire. And then down in the remote blackness of the gallery I heard a peculiar pattering, and the same odd noises I had heard down the well.</p> 
<p>`I took Weena's hand. Then, struck with a sudden idea, I left her and turned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike those in a signal-box. Clambering upon the stand, and grasping this lever in my hands, I put all my weight upon it sideways. Suddenly Weena, deserted in the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged the strength of the lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a minute's strain, and I rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than sufficient, I judged, for any Morlock skull I might encounter. And I longed very much to kill a Morlock or so. Very inhuman, you may think, to want to go killing one's own descendants! But it was impossible, somehow, to feel any humanity in the things. Only my disinclination to leave Weena, and a persuasion that if I began to slake my thirst for murder my Time Machine might suffer, restrained me from going straight down the gallery and killing the brutes I heard.</p> 
<p>`Well, mace in one hand and Weena in the other, I went out of that gallery and into another and still larger one, which at the first glance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags. The brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I presently recognized as the decaying vestiges of books. They had long since dropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had left them. But here and there were warped boards and cracked metallic clasps that told the tale well enough. Had I been a literary man I might, perhaps, have moralized upon the futility of all ambition. But as it was, the thing that struck me with keenest force was the enormous waste of labour to which this sombre wilderness of rotting paper testified. At the time I will confess that I thought chiefly of the PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS and my own seventeen papers upon physical optics.</p> 
<p>`Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have been a gallery of technical chemistry. And here I had not a little hope of useful discoveries. Except at one end where the roof had collapsed, this gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to every unbroken case. And at last, in one of the really air-tight cases, I found a box of matches. Very eagerly I tried them. They were perfectly good. They were not even damp. I turned to Weena. "Dance," I cried to her in her own tongue. For now I had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we feared. And so, in that derelict museum, upon the thick soft carpeting of dust, to Weena's huge delight, I solemnly performed a kind of composite dance, whistling THE LAND OF THE LEAL as cheerfully as I could. In part it was a modest CANCAN, in part a step dance, in part a skirt-dance (so far as my tail-coat permitted), and in part original. For I am naturally inventive, as you know.</p> 
<p>`Now, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped the wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange, as for me it was a most fortunate thing. Yet, oddly enough, I found a far unlikelier substance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealed jar, that by chance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed. I fancied at first that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass accordingly. But the odour of camphor was unmistakable. In the universal decay this volatile substance had chanced to survive, perhaps through many thousands of centuries. It reminded me of a sepia painting I had once seen done from the ink of a fossil Belemnite that must have perished and become fossilized millions of years ago. I was about to throw it away, but I remembered that it was inflammable and burned with a good bright flame--was, in fact, an excellent candle--and I put it in my pocket. I found no explosives, however, nor any means of breaking down the bronze doors. As yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing I had chanced upon. Nevertheless I left that gallery greatly elated.</p> 
<p>`I cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon. It would require a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all the proper order. I remember a long gallery of rusting stands of arms, and how I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a sword. I could not carry both, however, and my bar of iron promised best against the bronze gates. There were numbers of guns, pistols, and rifles. The most were masses of rust, but many were of some new metal, and still fairly sound. But any cartridges or powder there may once have been had rotted into dust. One corner I saw was charred and shattered; perhaps, I thought, by an explosion among the specimens. In another place was a vast array of idols--Polynesian, Mexican, Grecian, Phoenician, every country on earth I should think. And here, yielding to an irresistible impulse, I wrote my name upon the nose of a steatite monster from South America that particularly took my fancy.</p> 
<p>`As the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through gallery after gallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes mere heaps of rust and lignite, sometimes fresher. In one place I suddenly found myself near the model of a tin-mine, and then by the merest accident I discovered, in an air-tight case, two dynamite cartridges! I shouted "Eureka!" and smashed the case with joy. Then came a doubt. I hesitated. Then, selecting a little side gallery, I made my essay. I never felt such a disappointment as I did in waiting five, ten, fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came. Of course the things were dummies, as I might have guessed from their presence. I really believe that had they not been so, I should have rushed off incontinently and blown Sphinx, bronze doors, and (as it proved) my chances of finding the Time Machine, all together into nonexistence.</p> 
<p>`It was after that, I think, that we came to a little open court within the palace. It was turfed, and had three fruit- trees. So we rested and refreshed ourselves. Towards sunset I began to consider our position. Night was creeping upon us, and my inaccessible hiding-place had still to be found. But that troubled me very little now. I had in my possession a thing that was, perhaps, the best of all defences against the Morlocks--I had matches! I had the camphor in my pocket, too, if a blaze were needed. It seemed to me that the best thing we could do would be to pass the night in the open, protected by a fire. In the morning there was the getting of the Time Machine. Towards that, as yet, I had only my iron mace. But now, with my growing knowledge, I felt very differently towards those bronze doors. Up to this, I had refrained from forcing them, largely because of the mystery on the other side. They had never impressed me as being very strong, and I hoped to find my bar of iron not altogether inadequate for the work.</p> 
<p>“中午时分我们到达了青瓷殿。我发现宫殿里一片荒凉，墙倒瓦碎，只有破玻璃还残留在窗户上，一块块青色的墙面从生锈的金属框架上脱落下来。宫殿耸立在草皮覆盖的一块高地上。我走进宫殿前朝东北方向望了一眼，惊讶地发现那边有一个大港湾或者叫三角湾，我断定这是旺兹沃思和巴特西的原址。于是我想到了——尽管我根本没有细想下去——海里的生物可能经历的或正在经历的变化。</p> 
<p>“宫殿的建筑材料据我检查确实是陶瓷，我看到宫殿的门面上刻有一行我不认识的文字。我真是愚蠢，居然以为威娜可能会帮我翻译的，但我发现她的脑袋里压根不曾有过文字的概念。她在我的想象里似乎总要比真正的她更具人的特征，这或许是她的感情额通人性的缘故吧。</p> 
<p>“走进巨大的活动门——门是开着的，并且已经破破烂烂——我们发现的不是传统的大厅，而是一茶两侧开着许多窗户的长廊，我第一眼就想到它是个博物馆。砖铺的地上积着厚厚的尘土，许多杂七杂八的东西上也盖着灰蒙蒙的一层积尘。这时，我发现长厅中央竖着的瘦骨嶙峋的怪东西显然是一具大骨骼的下半部分。我从它偏斜的脚掌看出这是一种已经绝迹的大懒兽一样的动物，头盖骨和上身的骨头就埋在旁边厚厚的尘土里，由于屋顶漏水，有一处骨头已被侵蚀。长廊那边是一具巨大的雷龙骨架。我关于博物馆的假设得到了证实。再往边上走，我发现都是倾斜的架子，抹去厚厚的灰尘，我发现是我们自己时代里的那种熟悉的玻璃柜。从柜里一些保存良好的藏品判断，这些柜是密封的。</p> 
<p>“很明显，我俩是站在南肯辛顿后的废墟上！这里显然是古生物部，这些东西一定是非常精彩的化石。不可避免的腐蚀过程虽然一度得以避免，并因为细菌和真菌的灭绝丧失了它百分之九十九的腐蚀力，然而它现在肯定又在腐蚀这里的财宝，只是这一过程极为缓慢而已。我根据各处打碎的或用线串在芦苇上的稀有化石，发现了那些小人留下的痕迹。有些玻璃柜被移动过——我想是莫洛克人干的。这地方非常安静，厚厚的灰尘淹没了我们的脚步声。威娜一直在柜子的斜玻璃上滚海胆，见我东张西望，她立即走过来，不声不响地抓住我的手，站在我身旁。</p> 
<p>“起先，我对智慧时代的这个古代纪念馆感到非常吃惊，也就根本没去思考它显示出的种种可能性，甚至连我一直惦记着的时间机器也被抛到了脑后。</p> 
<p>“从宫殿的面积看，青瓷殿远不止有这个古生物馆，也许还有历史陈列馆，甚至还可能有个图书馆！对我来说，至少在目前的情况下，这些东西比正在被腐蚀的古代地质陈列品更富有吸引力。探寻中我又发现了一个和第～条长廊成直角的短走廊。它看上去像是专门陈列矿物的，我看到一块硫磺随即联想到了火药，但没有发现硝石，其实硝酸盐之类的东西都没发现。毫无疑问，它们很久以前就潮解了。不过那块硫磺留在了我的脑海里，使我浮想联翩。这个馆里的其他陈列品虽然从整体上说是我见到的保存最完好的东西，我却几乎不感兴趣。我不是什么矿物学家，于是我沿着和第一个大厅平行的一条破旧的过道继续朝前走去。显而易见，这个部分是自然史陈列室，可里边的东西早已面目全非。原先的动物标本，曾经装满酒精的坛子里的干尸，已经死去的植物的遗骸，现在都成了皱缩的黑乎乎的残余，这就是所有的一切！我对此感到遗憾，因为我原本应该乐意去追溯这长期不泄的再适应过程，人类正是通过对动植物的这一再适应征服了生气勃勃的大自然。接着我来到一个巨大的走廊，里边光线昏暗，地板从我进来的一头开始缓缓向下倾斜。天花板上间隔挂着白色的球，其中许多已经破碎，它表明这地方原先是靠人工照明的。我在这方面比较在行，因为我的两旁都摆着大机器，所有的机器都已严重腐蚀，而且许多机器已经损坏，不过也有一些仍然相当完整。你知道，我特别钟爱机器，我真想在这些机器之间多呆上一会儿，这主要是因为这些机器多半像谜一样吸引人，并且我对这些矾器的用途也根本猜不透。我想，如果能解开这些迷，那我就应该拥有可以用来对付莫洛克人的力量。</p> 
<p>“威娜突然来到我身旁，把我吓了一跳。如果不是她，我想我绝对不会注意到这走廊的地板是倾斜的。进门的一头比地面高出许多，光线从几扇像狭缝一样的窗户里照射进来。你沿着长廊朝前走，窗外的地面逐渐向这些窗户抬高，最后每扇窗户前都出现了一块低地，就像伦敦的房子，各家各户前都有一方‘空地’，只有一束光线从顶端照进来。我慢慢朝前走，心里琢磨着这些机器，由于思想过分集中，没有发觉室内的光线正在变暗，直到威娜显出越来越害怕的样子我才明白过来。这时，我发现这条长廊最后通向黑得什么也看不见的地方。我犹豫了，朝四周看看，发现这里的灰尘不多，灰尘的表面也不太平。在更里边的黑暗处，我发现了许多窄小的脚印。我立即意识到莫洛克人随时可能出现。我感到钻研这些机器完全是在浪费时间，又意识到时间已是下午晚些时候。我仍然没有找到武器，没有找到藏身之处，没有找到生火的工具。这时，远处漆黑的长廊里传来了奇特的啪啪声和我在井下听到的那种古怪声音。</p> 
<p>“我一把抓住威娜的手，这时心中突然有了主意。我松开威娜，转向一台机器，机器上伸出来一根铁杆，像信号所里的横杆。我爬上机器，抓住横杆，用尽力气往边上扳。突然间，被我留在中央过道里的威娜呜咽起来。我扳铁杆时判断正确，用力适度，不一会儿铁杆就砰的一声断了。我手握铁棒回到威娜身旁，在我看来，无论遇上哪个莫洛克人，这根棒都足以让他们脑袋开花。我真想干掉几个莫洛克人，你们也许会觉得我很残酷，居然想杀自己的后代！但不知什么原因，你遇上这些家伙就不可能大发慈悲。只是由于我不愿离开威娜，并且相信如果我去杀人解恨，时间机器就会遭殃，我才没有沿长廊走过去杀我听到的畜生。</p> 
<p>“于是，我一手握棒一手抱着威娜走出这条长廊，来到另一个更大的厅里。我一看到这个大厅就想起了挂满破旗的军用教堂。烧焦的棕色破烂挂在两旁，我当即认出来是烂书剩下来的残片，它们早就散架，所有的印刷符号都不见了。但到处都是翘起的木板和裂开的金属夹子，这已完全说明了问题。如果我是个文人，我也许会从道德的角度指出一切野心都是徒劳的。但面对眼前的情景，让我感触最深的是满地烂纸所证明的那种劳动力的巨大浪费。我承认，我那时主要想到的是《哲学学报》和我自己的十七八篇论述物理光学的论文。</p> 
<p>“接着，我们走上宽阔的楼梯，来到了可能曾经是应用化学馆的地方。我很希望在这里发现一些有用的东西。这个陈列馆除了一头的屋顶坍了，基本保存完好。我急忙走到各个柜前去探寻，最终在一只封得严严实实的柜子里找到了一盒火柴。我急不可待地试了一下，全能用，甚至一点也没受潮。我转向威娜。‘我们跳舞吧。’我用她的语言大声对她说。因为我找到了对付我们害怕的畜生的真正武器。于是，威娜感到乐不可支的是，在那荒芜的博物馆里，在那又厚又软的尘土上，我口中兴奋地吹着《天国》的调子，一本正经地表演了一段混合舞，其中部分是朴实无华的康康舞，部分是踢哒舞，部分是裙子舞（尽我燕尾服能发挥的功能），还有部分是我的创作舞。我这人天生富有创造力，这一点你们是知道的。</p> 
<p>“我现在仍然认为，这盒火柴能够逃过无数岁月的摧残实在是件奇怪的事，对我来说也是一件十分幸运的事。可稀奇透顶的是，我还发现了一样根本意想不到的东西，那就是樟脑。我是在一个封口的坛子里发现的，我以为这坛子也是偶然才封起来的。我起初认为是石蜡，随即砸碎了玻璃。但是樟脑的味道谁也不会搞错。在所有东西都在腐烂的时候，这种挥发性的物质碰巧幸存了下来，也许经历了好几千个世纪。它使我想起我见过的一幅乌贼墨画，画墨是用一种叫箭石的古生物化石制成的，这种生物死后变成化石的时间一定已有几百万年时间。我正想把樟脑扔掉，可又想起它是易燃物，燃烧时火光明亮，实在是很好的蜡烛，于是我将它装进了口袋。不过，我没有找到炸药，也没有发现任何可以打开铜门的工具。可我偶尔发现的那根铁棒是非常有用的东西，我还是得意洋洋地离开了那间陈列馆。</p> 
<p>“我没法把那个漫长的下午的事情都告诉你们。要把我的探险全部井然有序地回忆起来需要极强的记忆力。我记得有一个长廊里摆着铁锈斑斑的武器架，我左右为难，不知该拿铁挺还是短柄小斧还是剑，然而我又不能把它们都带上，何况我的铁棒有望成为打开铜门的最佳工具。长廊里有许多枪支，有手枪也有步枪。大多数枪已成一堆锈铁，但还有不少枪是用一种新式金属做的，仍可使用。不过原先摆在那里的子弹和炸药都已烂成尘土。我看到长廊的一个角落已烧黑并且已经破损，心想这也许是由弹药爆炸造成的。在另一个地方有许多偶像——波利尼西亚人、墨西哥人、希腊人、胖尼基人，我想地球上每个国家的人都有。我按捺不住内心的冲动，把自己的名字写到了一个蜡石怪兽的鼻子上，这个南美的怪兽特别讨我喜爱。</p> 
<p>“夜晚来临了，我的兴趣也渐渐退去。我从这个长廊走到那个长廊，长廊里盖满了灰尘，静悄悄的，到处是断垣残壁。陈列品有时完全像一堆锈铁和褐煤，有时倒还面目可辨。走着走着，我突然发现自己就在一个锡矿模型旁边，纯粹出于偶然，我在一个密封的柜子里发现了两个炸药筒！我大喊哦到啦’，兴奋之中把柜子也打碎了。这时，我又产生了疑问，犹豫了。我随后选定旁边的一条小走廊进行试爆。5分钟，10分钟，15分钟过去了，没有爆炸，我从来没有这么失望过。这东西无疑是摆设，我完全应该从它的外表猜到这点。不然的话，相信我会立即冲出去，把斯芬克斯塑像、铜门以及（事实证明如此）我找到时间机器的希望一同炸得荡然无存。</p> 
<p>“我想就在这之后，我们来到了宫殿内的一个露天庭院里。庭院里铺着草坪，还有三棵果树。于是我们歇下来振作振作精神。太阳西下的时候，我又开始考虑我俩的处境。夜色悄悄来临，我仍然没有找到别人无法到达的藏身之地。但这件事已不再让我惴惴不安。我拥有了恐怕是对付莫洛克人的最佳工具——我有火柴！如果需要大火的话，我口袋里还装着樟脑。我觉得最好的办法是烧堆火在露天过夜。天亮后去取时间机器，不过到时我手头仅有一根铁棒。但是现在，随着我的认识的不断加深，我对那些铜门的感受和以前截然不同了。我到现在都没去强行把门打开，这主要是因为门后面还是一个谜。铜门从未给我留下坚不可摧的印象，我希望到时我的铁棒用来开门是绰绰有余的。”</p>
