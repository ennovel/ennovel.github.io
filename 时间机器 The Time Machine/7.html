Hitherto, except during my night's anguish at the loss of the Time Machine, I had felt a sustaining hope of ultimate escape, but that hope was staggered by these new discoveries. Hitherto I had merely thought myself impeded by the childish simplicity of the little people, and by some unknown forces which I had only to understand to overcome; but there was an altogether new element in the sickening quality of the Morlocks--a something inhuman and malign. Instinctively I loathed them. Before, I had felt as a man might feel who had fallen into a pit: my concern was with the pit and how to get out of it. Now I felt like a beast in a trap, whose enemy would come upon him soon.</p> 
<p>`The enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the new moon. Weena had put this into my head by some at first incomprehensible remarks about the Dark Nights. It was not now such a very difficult problem to guess what the coming Dark Nights might mean. The moon was on the wane: each night there was a longer interval of darkness. And I now understood to some slight degree at least the reason of the fear of the little Upper-world people for the dark. I wondered vaguely what foul villainy it might be that the Morlocks did under the new moon. I felt pretty sure now that my second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upper-world people might once have been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks their mechanical servants: but that had long since passed away. The two species that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding down towards, or had already arrived at, an altogether new relationship. The Eloi, like the Carolingian kings, had decayed to a mere beautiful futility. They still possessed the earth on sufferance: since the Morlocks, subterranean for innumerable generations, had come at last to find the daylit surface intolerable. And the Morlocks made their garments, I inferred, and maintained them in their habitual needs, perhaps through the survival of an old habit of service. They did it as a standing horse paws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals in sport: because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on the organism. But, clearly, the old order was already in part reversed. The Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace. Ages ago, thousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out of the ease and the sunshine. And now that brother was coming back changed! Already the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew. They were becoming reacquainted with Fear. And suddenly there came into my head the memory of the meat I had seen in the Under-world. It seemed odd how it floated into my mind: not stirred up as it were by the current of my meditations, but coming in almost like a question from outside. I tried to recall the form of it. I had a vague sense of something familiar, but I could not tell what it was at the time.</p> 
<p>`Still, however helpless the little people in the presence of their mysterious Fear, I was differently constituted. I came out of this age of ours, this ripe prime of the human race, when Fear does not paralyse and mystery has lost its terrors. I at least would defend myself. Without further delay I determined to make myself arms and a fastness where I might sleep. With that refuge as a base, I could face this strange world with some of that confidence I had lost in realizing to what creatures night by night I lay exposed. I felt I could never sleep again until my bed was secure from them. I shuddered with horror to think how they must already have examined me.</p> 
<p>`I wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but found nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible. All the buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous climbers as the Morlocks, to judge by their wells, must be. Then the tall pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished gleam of its walls came back to my memory; and in the evening, taking Weena like a child upon my shoulder, I went up the hills towards the south-west. The distance, I had reckoned, was seven or eight miles, but it must have been nearer eighteen. I had first seen the place on a moist afternoon when distances are deceptively diminished. In addition, the heel of one of my shoes was loose, and a nail was working through the sole--they were comfortable old shoes I wore about indoors--so that I was lame. And it was already long past sunset when I came in sight of the palace, silhouetted black against the pale yellow of the sky.</p> 
<p>`Weena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but after a while she desired me to let her down, and ran along by the side of me, occasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers to stick in my pockets. My pockets had always puzzled Weena, but at the last she had concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vase for floral decoration. At least she utilized them for that purpose. And that reminds me! In changing my jacket I found . . .'</p> 
<p>The Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, and silently placed two withered flowers, not unlike very large white mallows, upon the little table. Then he resumed his narrative.</p> 
<p>`As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over the hill crest towards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to return to the house of grey stone. But I pointed out the distant pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived to make her understand that we were seeking a refuge there from her Fear. You know that great pause that comes upon things before the dusk? Even the breeze stops in the trees. To me there is always an air of expectation about that evening stillness. The sky was clear, remote, and empty save for a few horizontal bars far down in the sunset. Well, that night the expectation took the colour of my fears. In that darkling calm my senses seemed preternaturally sharpened. I fancied I could even feel the hollowness of the ground beneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see through it the Morlocks on their ant-hill going hither and thither and waiting for the dark. In my excitement I fancied that they would receive my invasion of their burrows as a declaration of war. And why had they taken my Time Machine?</p> 
<p>`So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night. The clear blue of the distance faded, and one star after another came out. The ground grew dim and the trees black. Weena's fears and her fatigue grew upon her. I took her in my arms and talked to her and caressed her. Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put her arms round my neck, and, closing her eyes, tightly pressed her face against my shoulder. So we went down a long slope into a valley, and there in the dimness I almost walked into a little river. This I waded, and went up the opposite side of the valley, past a number of sleeping houses, and by a statue--a Faun, or some such figure, MINUS the head. Here too were acacias. So far I had seen nothing of the Morlocks, but it was yet early in the night, and the darker hours before the old moon rose were still to come.</p> 
<p>`From the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide and black before me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to it, either to the right or the left. Feeling tired--my feet, in particular, were very sore--I carefully lowered Weena from my shoulder as I halted, and sat down upon the turf. I could no longer see the Palace of Green Porcelain, and I was in doubt of my direction. I looked into the thickness of the wood and thought of what it might hide. Under that dense tangle of branches one would be out of sight of the stars. Even were there no other lurking danger--a danger I did not care to let my imagination loose upon--there would still be all the roots to stumble over and the tree-boles to strike against.</p> 
<p>`I was very tired, too, after the excitements of the day; so I decided that I would not face it, but would pass the night upon the open hill.</p> 
<p>`Weena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped her in my jacket, and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. The hill-side was quiet and deserted, but from the black of the wood there came now and then a stir of living things. Above me shone the stars, for the night was very clear. I felt a certain sense of friendly comfort in their twinkling. All the old constellations had gone from the sky, however: that slow movement which is imperceptible in a hundred human lifetimes, had long since rearranged them in unfamiliar groupings. But the Milky Way, it seemed to me, was still the same tattered streamer of star-dust as of yore. Southward (as I judged it) was a very bright red star that was new to me; it was even more splendid than our own green Sirius. And amid all these scintillating points of light one bright planet shone kindly and steadily like the face of an old friend.</p> 
<p>`Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the gravities of terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable distance, and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of the unknown past into the unknown future. I thought of the great precessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes. Only forty times had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that I had traversed. And during these few revolutions all the activity, all the traditions, the complex organizations, the nations, languages, literatures, aspirations, even the mere memory of Man as I knew him, had been swept out of existence. Instead were these frail creatures who had forgotten their high ancestry, and the white Things of which I went in terror. Then I thought of the Great Fear that was between the two species, and for the first time, with a sudden shiver, came the clear knowledge of what the meat I had seen might be. Yet it was too horrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping beside me, her face white and starlike under the stars, and forthwith dismissed the thought.</p> 
<p>`Through that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well as I could, and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find signs of the old constellations in the new confusion. The sky kept very clear, except for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I dozed at times. Then, as my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward sky, like the reflection of some colourless fire, and the old moon rose, thin and peaked and white. And close behind, and overtaking it, and overflowing it, the dawn came, pale at first, and then growing pink and warm. No Morlocks had approached us. Indeed, I had seen none upon the hill that night. And in the confidence of renewed day it almost seemed to me that my fear had been unreasonable. I stood up and found my foot with the loose heel swollen at the ankle and painful under the heel; so I sat down again, took off my shoes, and flung them away.</p> 
<p>`I awakened Weena, and we went down into the wood, now green and pleasant instead of black and forbidding. We found some fruit wherewith to break our fast. We soon met others of the dainty ones, laughing and dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such thing in nature as the night. And then I thought once more of the meat that I had seen. I felt assured now of what it was, and from the bottom of my heart I pitied this last feeble rill from the great flood of humanity. Clearly, at some time in the Long-Ago of human decay the Morlocks' food had run short. Possibly they had lived on rats and such-like vermin. Even now man is far less discriminating and exclusive in his food than he was--far less than any monkey. His prejudice against human flesh is no deep-seated instinct. And so these inhuman sons of men----! I tried to look at the thing in a scientific spirit. After all, they were less human and more remote than our cannibal ancestors of three or four thousand years ago. And the intelligence that would have made this state of things a torment had gone. Why should I trouble myself? These Eloi were mere fatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks preserved and preyed upon--probably saw to the breeding of. And there was Weena dancing at my side!</p> 
<p>`Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming upon me, by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness. Man had been content to live in ease and delight upon the labours of his fellow-man, had taken Necessity as his watchword and excuse, and in the fullness of time Necessity had come home to him. I even tried a Carlyle-like scorn of this wretched aristocracy in decay. But this attitude of mind was impossible. However great their intellectual degradation, the Eloi had kept too much of the human form not to claim my sympathy, and to make me perforce a sharer in their degradation and their Fear.</p> 
<p>`I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should pursue. My first was to secure some safe place of refuge, and to make myself such arms of metal or stone as I could contrive. That necessity was immediate. In the next place, I hoped to procure some means of fire, so that I should have the weapon of a torch at hand, for nothing, I knew, would be more efficient against these Morlocks. Then I wanted to arrange some contrivance to break open the doors of bronze under the White Sphinx. I had in mind a battering ram. I had a persuasion that if I could enter those doors and carry a blaze of light before me I should discover the Time Machine and escape. I could not imagine the Morlocks were strong enough to move it far away. Weena I had resolved to bring with me to our own time. And turning such schemes over in my mind I pursued our way towards the building which my fancy had chosen as our dwelling.</p> 
<p>“老实说，这下我的处境比先前更糟了。我只是丢失时间机器的那天晚上痛苦万分，过后一直抱着最终将逃出去的希望，可这一希望被这些新发现动摇了。我一直都只是认为我是被这些小人孩子般的单纯和某种我理解后就能克服的莫名的力量所阻挠。但莫洛克人令人作呕的品性里有一种全新的成分——一种非人的邪恶的成分，我本能地讨厌他们。以前，我感到自己像个掉进坑里的人，关心的是坑和怎样爬出坑来。现在，我感到自己像只即将受到敌人进攻的困兽。</p> 
<p>“我害怕的敌人也许会让你们大吃一惊，它是新月时的黑夜，是威娜让我这样担心受怕的，她就是在黑夜说了一通起初听起来有点莫名其妙的话。现在要猜想即将来临的黑夜意味着什么并不很难。月亮已过下弦，黑夜一天比一天长。我现在至少有点知道了那些地上的小人为什么如此害怕黑暗。我总弄不清楚，莫洛克人在新月下会干什么不可告人的事。我现在感到肯定的是，我的第二假设是完全错误的。地上人也许曾经是受到优待的贵族，莫洛克人只是受他们吩咐的仆人，可这早已是昨日黄花。从人类进化来的这两个人种正在走向或者说已经形成一种全新的关系。埃洛伊人就像卡洛林王朝的国王，退化成了美丽却无用的摆设。他们勉强被容许拥有地面，因为莫洛克人世代生活在地下，最后发现日光照射的地面使他们无法忍受。我推断，莫洛克人为埃洛伊人做衣服并且维持他们的这一习惯需求，是因为他们服侍人的旧习惯没有改变。他们这样做和站着的马要踢踢脚，或者有的人喜欢狩猎一样自然，因为过去的和从前的需求已留下印痕。不过很显然，旧的次序已有所颠倒，惩罚娇生惯养者的复仇之神正在迅速爬过来。很久以前，几千代人以前，人类把他的同胞从安逸和阳光里赶走，现在这同胞回来啦——他们变啦！埃洛伊人已开始接受老文章里的新教训，他们重温了恐惧的滋味。我突然想到我在地下世界看到的肉，突然记起这事也真够奇怪的，它不是我的思绪引发的，而像一个外界的问题陡然闯入脑海的。我想把那东西的形状想想清楚，却只是模模糊糊地觉得它是我熟悉的东西，可又说不清它到底是什么。</p> 
<p>“不过，无论这些小人在他们的恐惧面前显得多么无可奈何，我和他们身份不同。我来自我们的这个时代，来自人类成熟的全盛时期，恐惧吓木倒我们，神秘也已失去它的恐怖魔力。我至少会防卫自己，我决定说干就干，立即动手自制武器，再造一个坚不可摧的睡觉堡垒。用它作为基地，我就能够有所信心地面对这个陌生的世界，这信心在我发现每夜睡在莫洛克人眼皮底下后就失去了。我感到不把床搬到安全的地方就简直无法睡觉。一想到他们一定曾这样或那样地观察过我，我就心惊肉跳。</p> 
<p>“下午我徘徊在泰晤士河谷边，可没有找到我以为是别人难以接近的地方。所有的建筑和树林对莫洛克人这样灵巧的攀爬者似乎都是容易到达的，只要看看他们的井，你就会对此深信不疑。这时，我又想起青瓷殿上高高的尖顶和它闪光的墙壁。傍晚，我把威娜当作孩子似地扛在肩膀上，朝西南方向的山上走去。我估计路程为七至八英里，可我跑了将近18英里的路。我第一次看到那地方是在一个阴雨的下午，那时候目测的距离往往会比实际距离短。此外，我一只鞋的后跟松了，一只鞋钉戳穿了鞋底——这是我在室内穿的一双很舒适的便鞋——所以走路时只得一瘸一拐。当我走到看得见宫殿的时候，太阳早已落山，淡黄色的天空映衬出了宫殿黑乎乎的轮廓。</p> 
<p>“我开始扛威娜的时候，她非常开心，可不一会儿她就要我放她下来。她跟在我旁边，有时还冲到两边去采些鲜花插到我口袋里。我的口袋总让威娜感到迷惑不解，但最后她得出结论，认为它们是用于插花的一种古怪花瓶，至少她是这样使用我的口袋的。对了，想起来了！我换外套时发现……”</p> 
<p>时间游客停了来，把手伸进口袋，不声不响地把两大朵像是已经凋谢的白锦葵放到小桌予上，接裆他继续往下讲。</p> 
<p>“傍晚时分，大地静悄悄的。我们继续上山朝温布尔登走去，威娜感到很累，想回灰石屋去。但我把远处青瓷殿的尖顶指给她看，想让她明白我们是去那里寻找躲避恐惧的地方。你们了解黄昏前万物沉寂的情景吗？连微风都在树梢上静止了。在我看来，这万籁俱寂的傍晚总是弥漫着一种期待的气氛。这时的天空晴朗、遥远而又空旷，只有天边残留下几道日落后的余晖。那天晚上，这种期待的气氛更加突出了我内心的恐惧。在那神秘莫测的平静中，我的感官好像异常敏锐，我甚至觉得可以感受到我脚底下的地洞，真的几乎可以透过洞穴看到蚁冢上的莫洛克人走来走去等待着黑夜的来临。我感到紧张不安，心想他们会把我进入他们的地洞看成是我的宣战。可他们为什么要拿走我的时间机器呢？</p> 
<p>“我们就这样在寂静中走着，黄昏变成了黑夜。远处朗朗的蓝色已经退去，星星一个接一个钻了出来。大地腾陇，树林里一片漆黑，威娜越来越怕，越走越累。我把她抱起来，和她讲话并安抚她。这时，天色更黑了，她搂住我的脖子，闭上眼睛，把脸紧贴在我的肩膀上。就这样我们走下一个长坡来到一个河谷里。天色暗淡，我差点走到一条小河的深处去。我膛过小河，走到河谷的对面，经过许多住房和一尊塑像——一个连头也没有的农牧神之类的塑像。这里也都是胶树。到现在为止，我还没见到莫洛克人的影子，不过现在还不是深夜，月亮升起前更黑暗的时刻还没有到来。</p> 
<p>“远望接下去要翻越的山坡，我看到展现在我面前的是一片黑压压的茂密的野树林。我犹豫了，树林两边都望不到尽头。我感到累了，那双脚尤其酸痛，我停下脚步，小心翼翼地从肩膀上放下威娜，随后在草坪上坐了下来。我看不见青瓷殿，怀疑自己走错了方向。我朝茂密的树林看看，心想什么东西会藏在里边呢。你在那浓密的纵横交叉的树枝下连天上的星星都看不见。即便木存在其他潜在的危险，那伯是我自己任意想象的危险，起码有绊人的树根和撞人的树干。经过一天的情绪刺激，我已经疲惫不堪。于是我决定停止前进，在光秃秃的山上过夜。</p> 
<p>“我很高兴发现感娜已经熟睡了。我轻手轻脚地用外套把她裹起来，坐在她身旁等待月亮的出现。山腰里无声无息，可黑乎乎的树林里不时传来动静。这是一个晴朗的夜晚，头顶上星光闪烁。我在这闪烁的星光里感受到了一种朋友般的安慰。然而，旧的星座都已从天空中消失：这一百辈子都难以觉察的缓慢运动早已把星座重新分成了我们不熟悉的群体。但依我看，银河仍是从前由星群组成的破碎的光带。南边（我判断是南边）有一颗很亮的红星，这颗星我并不熟悉，它甚至比我们自己的天狼星还要明亮。在这些闪耀的星点里，一颗明亮的行星慈祥而坚定地闪烁着，就像一张老朋友的脸。</p> 
<p>“仰望这些星星，我突然觉得自己的麻烦和尘世生活的一切危险都显得微不足道了。我想到它们远不可测的距离，它们缓慢的不可避免的运动，从木可知的过去走进不可知的未来，我想到地球运转时画出来的一个巨大的圆。它在我走过的全部岁月里才静静地转了40圈。在这寥寥可数的40次旋转里，所有的运动，所有的传统、复杂的组织、民族、语言、文学、灵感，甚至连我记忆中熟悉的那种人都被一扫而光。取而代之的就是这些忘了祖先的脆弱者和那些我害怕的白色动物。这时我想到了这两个种类之间的巨大恐惧，第一次明白了我见到的肉可能是什么，禁不住打了个寒战。可这简直是太可怕了！我望着熟睡在我身旁的威娜，星光下她的睑像星星一样苍白，我立即打消了心中的这个想法。</p> 
<p>“长夜漫漫，我尽量不去想莫洛克人。我设法想象我在这新的混乱状态中定能发现旧星座的痕迹，并以此来消磨时光。夜空还是那样晴朗，只是有一两朵雾膜膝的云彩。无疑我也打了几次瞌睡。就在我继续守夜时，天空的东方出现了淡淡的光亮，像是无色火焰的反光。下弦月升起来了，又弯又尖又白。黎明接遗而来，它赶上月亮又超过了月亮，起初是白色，然后变成了暖烘烘的粉红色。没有莫洛克人靠近我们，其实那天夜里我在山上连个莫洛克人影也没见到。我对新的一天充满了信心，几乎觉得的恐惧毫无道理。我站起身，发现鞋跟松掉的那只脚的踝关节肿了起来，脚后跟很痛，于是我又坐下来，脱下鞋子把它们扔了。</p> 
<p>“我叫醒威娜，我们一起走进了树林。这时的树林不再是黑乎乎的叫人望而怯步，而是翠绿欲滴，让人心旷神怕。我俩在树林里找了一些水果充当早饭，不久又遇上了那些小巧玲现的人，他们在阳光下又是笑又是跳，好像大自然里根本没有黑夜这回事。接着我又想到我看见的肉，这下我肯定那是什么了，我从心底里同情人类洪流中这最后的涓涓小溪。很显然，早在人类衰败的过程中，莫洛克人的食物就已不足，他们也许是靠吃老鼠之类的害虫活下来的。即使现在，人类在吃的上面也远远没有他原来那样考究和挑剔——远没有猴子挑食，他对人肉所持的偏见也不是什么根深蒂固的本能。看看人类的这些畜生子女吧——！我试图用科学的态度来看待这件事。不管怎么说，他们只是比我们三四千年前的祖先更缺少一点人性，更遥远一点罢了，而且原可以使吃人的事情变成一种折磨的良知已经氓灭了。我为何还要去自寻烦恼？这些埃洛伊人就是肥肥的牲口。就是蚂蚁一样的莫洛克人保存和食用的，也许是他们负责饲养的。威娜此刻却在我身旁欢蹦乱跳！</p> 
<p>“这时，我感到一阵恐慌袭来，为了摆脱恐慌，我把吃人的事看作是对人类自私行为的一种严惩。人类依靠同胞的艰辛劳动心满意足地生活在安逸和快乐之中，把需要作为他的格言和借口，这需要早已埋在他的心中。我甚至想对这个处在衰败中的可怜的贵族阶级表示卡莱尔式的蔑视。但抱这种思想态度是不可能的。无论他们的智力退化到了何种地步，埃洛伊人保留了许多人类的特征，这使我不得不去同情他们，并且必然地使我去分担他们的衰退和恐惧。</p> 
<p>“我那时对自己该走哪条路看法很模糊。我首先要寻找一个安全的藏身之地，为自己制造一些力所能及的金属或石头武器，这是当务之急。其次，我希望弄到生火的工具，好让我手上有个火炬之类的武器，因为我清楚这是对付莫洛克人最有效的手段。最后，我想发明一个东西来打开白色斯芬克斯像下的座基铜门，我脑子里念念不忘的是攻城相。我坚信，如果我能走进那些门，我手握火把一定能找到时间机器，然后逃走。我无法想象莫洛克人力气大得可以把时间机器搬到很远的地方。我已决定把威娜带到我们自己的时代来。我脑子里翻来复去想着这些计划，继续朝我凭空选为住所的那幢建筑走去。”</p>
