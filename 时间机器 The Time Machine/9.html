I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the next morning, and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woods that had stopped me on the previous journey. My plan was to go as far as possible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleep in the protection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along I gathered any sticks or dried grass I saw, and presently had my arms full of such litter. Thus loaded, our progress was slower than I had anticipated, and besides Weena was tired. And I began to suffer from sleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached the wood. Upon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped, fearing the darkness before us; but a singular sense of impending calamity, that should indeed have served me as a warning, drove me onward. I had been without sleep for a night and two days, and I was feverish and irritable. I felt sleep coming upon me, and the Morlocks with it.</p> 
<p>`While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim against their blackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was scrub and long grass all about us, and I did not feel safe from their insidious approach. The forest, I calculated, was rather less than a mile across. If we could get through it to the bare hill-side, there, as it seemed to me, was an altogether safer resting-place; I thought that with my matches and my camphor I could contrive to keep my path illuminated through the woods. Yet it was evident that if I was to flourish matches with my hands I should have to abandon my firewood; so, rather reluctantly, I put it down. And then it came into my head that I would amaze our friends behind by lighting it. I was to discover the atrocious folly of this proceeding, but it came to my mind as an ingenious move for covering our retreat.</p> 
<p>`I don't know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must be in the absence of man and in a temperate climate. The sun's heat is rarely strong enough to burn, even when it is focused by dewdrops, as is sometimes the case in more tropical districts. Lightning may blast and blacken, but it rarely gives rise to widespread fire. Decaying vegetation may occasionally smoulder with the heat of its fermentation, but this rarely results in flame. In this decadence, too, the art of fire-making had been forgotten on the earth. The red tongues that went licking up my heap of wood were an altogether new and strange thing to Weena.</p> 
<p>`She wanted to run to it and play with it. I believe she would have cast herself into it had I not restrained her. But I caught her up, and in spite of her struggles, plunged boldly before me into the wood. For a little way the glare of my fire lit the path. Looking back presently, I could see, through the crowded stems, that from my heap of sticks the blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent, and a curved line of fire was creeping up the grass of the hill. I laughed at that, and turned again to the dark trees before me. It was very black, and Weena clung to me convulsively, but there was still, as my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness, sufficient light for me to avoid the stems. Overhead it was simply black, except where a gap of remote blue sky shone down upon us here and there. I struck none of my matches because I had no hand free. Upon my left arm I carried my little one, in my right hand I had my iron bar.</p> 
<p>`For some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet, the faint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the throb of the blood-vessels in my ears. Then I seemed to know of a pattering about me. I pushed on grimly. The pattering grew more distinct, and then I caught the same queer sound and voices I had heard in the Under-world. There were evidently several of the Morlocks, and they were closing in upon me. Indeed, in another minute I felt a tug at my coat, then something at my arm. And Weena shivered violently, and became quite still.</p> 
<p>`It was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I did so, and, as I fumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in the darkness about my knees, perfectly silent on her part and with the same peculiar cooing sounds from the Morlocks. Soft little hands, too, were creeping over my coat and back, touching even my neck. Then the match scratched and fizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the white backs of the Morlocks in flight amid the trees. I hastily took a lump of camphor from my pocket, and prepared to light is as soon as the match should wane. Then I looked at Weena. She was lying clutching my feet and quite motionless, with her face to the ground. With a sudden fright I stooped to her. She seemed scarcely to breathe. I lit the block of camphor and flung it to the ground, and as it split and flared up and drove back the Morlocks and the shadows, I knelt down and lifted her. The wood behind seemed full of the stir and murmur of a great company!</p> 
<p>`She seemed to have fainted. I put her carefully upon my shoulder and rose to push on, and then there came a horrible realization. In manoeuvring with my matches and Weena, I had turned myself about several times, and now I had not the faintest idea in what direction lay my path. For all I knew, I might be facing back towards the Palace of Green Porcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had to think rapidly what to do. I determined to build a fire and encamp where we were. I put Weena, still motionless, down upon a turfy bole, and very hastily, as my first lump of camphor waned, I began collecting sticks and leaves. Here and there out of the darkness round me the Morlocks' eyes shone like carbuncles.</p> 
<p>`The camphor flickered and went out. I lit a match, and as I did so, two white forms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away. One was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me, and I felt his bones grind under the blow of my fist. He gave a whoop of dismay, staggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another piece of camphor, and went on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed how dry was some of the foliage above me, for since my arrival on the Time Machine, a matter of a week, no rain had fallen. So, instead of casting about among the trees for fallen twigs, I began leaping up and dragging down branches. Very soon I had a choking smoky fire of green wood and dry sticks, and could economize my camphor. Then I turned to where Weena lay beside my iron mace. I tried what I could to revive her, but she lay like one dead. I could not even satisfy myself whether or not she breathed.</p> 
<p>`Now, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must have made me heavy of a sudden. Moreover, the vapour of camphor was in the air. My fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so. I felt very weary after my exertion, and sat down. The wood, too, was full of a slumbrous murmur that I did not understand. I seemed just to nod and open my eyes. But all was dark, and the Morlocks had their hands upon me. Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastily felt in my pocket for the match-box, and--it had gone! Then they gripped and closed with me again. In a moment I knew what had happened. I had slept, and my fire had gone out, and the bitterness of death came over my soul. The forest seemed full of the smell of burning wood. I was caught by the neck, by the hair, by the arms, and pulled down. It was indescribably horrible in the darkness to feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt as if I was in a monstrous spider's web. I was overpowered, and went down. I felt little teeth nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I did so my hand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength. I struggled up, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the bar short, I thrust where I judged their faces might be. I could feel the succulent giving of flesh and bone under my blows, and for a moment I was free.</p> 
<p>`The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard fighting came upon me. I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but I determined to make the Morlocks pay for their meat. I stood with my back to a tree, swinging the iron bar before me. The whole wood was full of the stir and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voices seemed to rise to a higher pitch of excitement, and their movements grew faster. Yet none came within reach. I stood glaring at the blackness. Then suddenly came hope. What if the Morlocks were afraid? And close on the heels of that came a strange thing. The darkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly I began to see the Morlocks about me--three battered at my feet--and then I recognized, with incredulous surprise, that the others were running, in an incessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through the wood in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish. As I stood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap of starlight between the branches, and vanish. And at that I understood the smell of burning wood, the slumbrous murmur that was growing now into a gusty roar, the red glow, and the Morlocks' flight.</p> 
<p>`Stepping out from behind my tree and looking back, I saw, through the black pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning forest. It was my first fire coming after me. With that I looked for Weena, but she was gone. The hissing and crackling behind me, the explosive thud as each fresh tree burst into flame, left little time for reflection. My iron bar still gripped, I followed in the Morlocks' path. It was a close race. Once the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as I ran that I was outflanked and had to strike off to the left. But at last I emerged upon a small open space, and as I did so, a Morlock came blundering towards me, and past me, and went on straight into the fire!</p> 
<p>`And now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think, of all that I beheld in that future age. This whole space was as bright as day with the reflection of the fire. In the centre was a hillock or tumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond this was another arm of the burning forest, with yellow tongues already writhing from it, completely encircling the space with a fence of fire. Upon the hill-side were some thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled by the light and heat, and blundering hither and thither against each other in their bewilderment. At first I did not realize their blindness, and struck furiously at them with my bar, in a frenzy of fear, as they approached me, killing one and crippling several more. But when I had watched the gestures of one of them groping under the hawthorn against the red sky, and heard their moans, I was assured of their absolute helplessness and misery in the glare, and I struck no more of them.</p> 
<p>`Yet every now and then one would come straight towards me, setting loose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him. At one time the flames died down somewhat, and I feared the foul creatures would presently be able to see me. I was thinking of beginning the fight by killing some of them before this should happen; but the fire burst out again brightly, and I stayed my hand. I walked about the hill among them and avoided them, looking for some trace of Weena. But Weena was gone.</p> 
<p>`At last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this strange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro, and making uncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beat on them. The coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky, and through the rare tatters of that red canopy, remote as though they belonged to another universe, shone the little stars. Two or three Morlocks came blundering into me, and I drove them off with blows of my fists, trembling as I did so.</p> 
<p>`For the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a nightmare. I bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I beat the ground with my hands, and got up and sat down again, and wandered here and there, and again sat down. Then I would fall to rubbing my eyes and calling upon God to let me awake. Thrice I saw Morlocks put their heads down in a kind of agony and rush into the flames. But, at last, above the subsiding red of the fire, above the streaming masses of black smoke and the whitening and blackening tree stumps, and the diminishing numbers of these dim creatures, came the white light of the day.</p> 
<p>`I searched again for traces of Weena, but there were none. It was plain that they had left her poor little body in the forest. I cannot describe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the awful fate to which it seemed destined. As I thought of that, I was almost moved to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about me, but I contained myself. The hillock, as I have said, was a kind of island in the forest. From its summit I could now make out through a haze of smoke the Palace of Green Porcelain, and from that I could get my bearings for the White Sphinx. And so, leaving the remnant of these damned souls still going hither and thither and moaning, as the day grew clearer, I tied some grass about my feet and limped on across smoking ashes and among black stems, that still pulsated internally with fire, towards the hiding-place of the Time Machine. I walked slowly, for I was almost exhausted, as well as lame, and I felt the intensest wretchedness for the horrible death of little Weena. It seemed an overwhelming calamity. Now, in this old familiar room, it is more like the sorrow of a dream than an actual loss. But that morning it left me absolutely lonely again--terribly alone. I began to think of this house of mine, of this fireside, of some of you, and with such thoughts came a longing that was pain.</p> 
<p>`But as I walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning sky, I made a discovery. In my trouser pocket were still some loose matches. The box must have leaked before it was lost.</p> 
<p>“我们走出青瓷殿时，太阳还没有从地平线上完全消失。我决定第二天一早赶赴白色斯芬克斯雕像，以便黄昏前穿过我上次出门使我受阻的那片树林。我的计划是当晚尽量多赶些路，然后生推火，在火光的保护下睡觉过夜。于是，我们赶路时，见到树枝枯草我便收集起来，不一会儿，我怀里已揣满柴火。由于手抱柴火行动木便，我们赶路的速度比我预期的要慢，另外，威娜已经走累了，我也开始精神不济，困得直想睡觉。因此，在我们赶到树林前天就完全黑了。走到树林边长满灌木丛的小山上时，威娜因害怕我们面对的一片黑暗，想停下来不走了。但当时我只感到灾祸即将来临（这对我确实应该是一种警告），这种感觉驱使我继续向前。我已经两天一夜没有睡觉了，只觉得头昏脑胀，心烦意乱，眼睛睁都睁不开，脑子里还尽想着莫洛克人。</p> 
<p>“正犹豫不决时，我看到身后漆黑的灌木丛里有三个蹲伏着的黑影。我们身旁全是树丛野草，他们这样伺机靠上来我感到很不安全。我估算过，树林不足1英里宽。如果我们能穿过树林到达光秃秃的山腰，我觉得那里是比较安全的休息之地。我想，我有火柴和樟脑，不用摸黑过树林。可是很明显，如果我要用双手不停地挥舞火柴，就必须放弃手里抱着的柴火。就这样，我极不情愿地放下了柴火。这时，我突然想到，点着柴火可以把我们背后的那几个朋友吓跑。后来我发现这个做法既残暴又赢蠢，可我原以为这是掩护我们撤退的锦囊妙计呢？</p> 
<p>“不知道你们是否想到过，在没有人类和气候温暖的地方火焰是多么罕见的东西啊。太阳的热度很少能强烈到引起着火，即便像热带地区有时靠露珠来聚焦阳光也不行。闪电可以摧毁和烧焦东西，却很少能引起燎原大火。腐烂的植物有时会因为发酵生热而熏烧起来，却很少能导致熊熊烈火。在这个退化的时代，生火的艺术也在地球上被人遗忘了。正在吞食我那堆柴火的红火舌在威娜的眼中完全是新奇的。</p> 
<p>“她想跑过去玩火。要不是我及时制止，我相信她会冲到火里去的。但我一把抓起她，不顾她的挣扎，大胆地朝身前的树林深处走去。我点燃的火堆照了我们一小段路。不一会儿，我回头张望，透过茂密的树干，我看见火焰从柴堆上烧到了附近的灌木丛，一条弯曲的火龙正朝山上的野草爬去。我望着火龙放声大笑，接着又转身朝我身前漆黑的树林里走去。真是天昏地暗，威娜发狂似地紧贴着我，可当我的双眼从黑暗中适应过来后，我仍可以借助微弱的亮光避开树干。头顶上也是漆黑一团，只是透过偶而出现的树枝间的缝隙才能看到遥远的夜空。路上我一根火柴也没点，因为腾不出手，我左手抱着我的小宝贝，右手摸着铁棒。</p> 
<p>“一段路走下来，我什么动静也没听到，只听到脚踩树枝发出的劈啪声，头上微风的沙沙声，自己的呼吸声和脉博的跳动声。这时，好像觉得四周有啪啪的声响，我继续勇敢地向前走去，啪啪声越来越清晰，接着我听到了我在地下世界听到的那种古怪声音。显然有几个莫洛克人就在附近，并且正在向我靠拢。果然，没过多久我感到有东西使劲拉了拉我的外套，随后又碰了下我的手臂。威娜浑身发抖，紧接着又静止不动了。</p> 
<p>“是划火柴的时候了。但要掏火柴我就必须把威娜放下来。我放下威娜，伸手到口袋里摸火柴。就在这时，我膝盖旁的一场争斗在黑暗中开始了，威娜一声不吭，莫洛克人还是发着那种奇怪的咕咕声。柔软的小手也伸到我的外套和后背上，甚至摸到我的脖子上。这时火柴亮了，发出嘶嘶的声响。我举起点亮的火柴，看见了莫洛克人在树林中逃窜的白色背影。我赶忙从口袋里掏出一块樟脑，准备在火柴熄灭前把它点燃。接着我看了看威娜，她脸朝地躺着，双手紧拉着我的脚，一动也不动。我猛然一惊，弯下腰去，她好像已经停止呼吸。我点燃手中的樟脑，把它扔到地上。火劈劈啪啪越烧越旺，赶跑了莫洛克人和所有的黑影，我跪下去把威娜抱起来。身后的树林里好像到处都是骚动声和低语声！</p> 
<p>“她好像是晕了过去。我小心翼翼地把她放上我的肩膀，站起身继续朝前走。这时，我意识到了一件可怕的事情。在掏火柴点火以及把威娜抱上抱下的时候，我转了几个身，现在我根本搞不清该朝哪个方向走了。谁知道呢，也许现在又转过身面朝青瓷殿了。我吓得直冒冷汗，我必须拿定主意该怎么办，决定生堆火在原地扎营。我把仍然一动不动的威娜放到了一块泥炭似的地上。第一块樟脑快要烧完了，我急忙开始收集枯枝落叶。在四周的黑暗中，莫洛克人的眼睛像红宝石一样忽闪忽闪。</p> 
<p>“樟脑的火光闪了几下终于灭了。我划亮一根火柴，这时两个正在靠近威娜的白色身影拔腿就跑。其中一个被火光照花了眼，竟直冲我来。我挥拳打去，只觉他的头盖骨嘎嘎作响。他发出一声惊叫，摇晃几步后倒下了。我又点燃一块樟脑、继续收集柴火。这时我注意到头顶上有些树叶非常干燥，因为自从我坐时间机器来到这里，大约一个星期吧，老天没有下过雨。于是，我不再去搜寻掉下来的枯枝，而是跳起来拉树叶。一会功夫，我就用绿叶和干树枝燃起了一堆呛人的烟火，这样可以节约我的樟脑。接着，我转身望了望躺在铁棒边上的威娜。我想尽一切办法把她弄醒，可她躺在那里像个死人，我甚至搞不清楚她是否已经断气。</p> 
<p>“火堆上的烟直往我这边吹，一下子呛得我昏昏沉沉。此外，空气中还弥漫着一股樟脑昧。火堆1小时内不需添加燃料。经过这段时间的劳顿，我感到很累很困，于是坐了下来。树林里还是充满了我听不懂的那种让人昏昏欲睡的低语声。我好像刚要打脑就把眼睛睁开了，可周围已是一片漆黑。莫洛克人的手摸到了我的身上，我甩开他们抓着我的手指，匆忙到口袋里去摸火柴盒，糟了——火柴盒不见了！这时他们抓住我，又把我团团围住。我顿时意识到了刚才发生的事情。我睡着了，然后火灭了，然后死亡的痛苦向我袭来。树林里似乎弥漫着木头燃烧的气味。我的脖子、头发、双臂都被抓住了，随后我被拉倒在地。黑暗中我感到这些软绵绵的东西都压到了我的身上，我害怕极了。我感到自己好像被困在了一个巨蛛蛛网里。我支撑不住了，垮了下来。我感到有小牙齿在咬我的脖子。我在地上翻了个身，这下我的手拿到了铁棒，我的勇气上来了，我挣扎着站起来，抖掉身上的这种人鼠，猛地举起铁棒，朝我估计是他们的脸的地方桶过去。我感到他们在铁棒的挥打下血肉横飞，我一下子摆脱了他们，又获得了自由。</p> 
<p>“人们在进行艰巨的斗争时好像常常会有一种奇特的欣喜，我此刻也感受到了这份欣喜。我知道我和威娜都成了迷路人，但我决心要让莫洛克人为他们所吃的肉付出应有的代价。我背靠一棵树站着，手中的铁捧在挥舞。树林里到处都是骚动声和他们的叫喊声。1分钟过去了，他们的声音似乎变成了激动的尖叫，他们的行动也越来越快。可是他们谁也没有进入我的铁棒够得着的地方。我站在那里，双目注视着眼前的黑暗。这时希望突然出现了。要是莫洛克人害怕了又会怎么样呢？紧接着发生了一桩怪事。黑暗中好像出现了光亮，依稀看到了我周围的莫洛克人，三个被打烂的就躺在我脚边。接着我大吃一惊，发现其他的莫洛克人都在跑，好似一条弯弯曲曲的溪流，从我身后流到了身前的树林远处。他们的背影好像不再是白色的，而是变成了红色。当我站着发愣时，我看见一点火星飘过树枝间的星光又消失了。我这才明白了燃烧的木头发出的气味，明白了为什么催眠似的低语正在变为一阵阵吼叫，明白了红火星，明白了莫洛克人为什么落荒而逃。</p> 
<p>“我从靠着的树后跑出来，从近处黑乎乎的树干间看到整个树林在燃烧。原来是我起先点的那堆火在朝我烧过来。我借着火光寻找威娜，可是威娜不见了。身后传来了嘶嘶声、劈啪声以及每一棵树着火时发出的爆裂声，这使我没有时间多作考虑。我手摄铁棒，沿着莫洛克人的路走去。这是一场争分夺秒的赛跑。火焰一度飞速向我右侧漫延，烧到我的前边，我只得赶紧让到左边。但我最终跑到了一小块空旷地上，这时一个莫洛克人跌跌撞撞朝我走来，从我身旁经过，一直冲到了火海里！</p> 
<p>“我想，接下去我要看到的是我在未来时代里见到的最不可思议最可怕的事。整片空旷地被火光照得如同白昼。空地中央是一个小丘或者是一座古坟，顶上是一棵烧焦了的山楂树。空地那边也是一片着火的树林，烈火熊熊，火墙把整个空地围得严严实实。山腰里大约有三四十个莫洛克人，他们被火焰和热浪搞得晕头转向，相互在慌乱中乱模乱撞。起初我并不知道他们在亮光下什么也看不见，见他们靠近时我惊恐不已，挥动铁棒，朝他们狠敲过去，打死一个，打伤了几个。但是现在，在火光映红的天空下我注意到一个莫洛克人在山植树下瞎摸，并且还听到了他们的呻吟声，我这才断定他们在眩目的光亮下肯定无可奈何，痛苦不堪，于是我停止了敲打。</p> 
<p>“但不时还有莫洛克人朝我冲过来，看到他们令人战栗的神情，我只得躲到一边。大火一度莫名其妙地小了下来。我担心这些可恶的东西随即会发现我，甚至考虑到先下手打死他们几个。可是火又旺了起来，我放下手里的铁棒，绕开他们，在山上走来走去，寻找威娜的踪影，但是威娜不见了。</p> 
<p>“最后我在小丘顶上坐下来，注视着这群奇怪又让人难以相信的瞎子在火光下模来摸去，彼此发出神秘的叫声。潦绕而上的烟雾飘过天空，遥远得仿佛属于另一个宇宙的小星星在红色的苍穹下闪烁。两三个莫洛克人撞到我身上，我挥拳把他们打跑，打的时候我自己也在发抖。</p> 
<p>“这一夜的大半部分时间里，我都相信这是一场恶梦。我咬着自己的嘴唇，还拼命叫喊，想弄醒自己。我用手捶地，起身又坐下，从这里荡到那里，随后又坐了下来。我开始用手揉我的双眼，祈求上帝让我醒过来。我几次看见莫洛克人痛苦地低下头冲进了火焰‘但是，在渐渐熄去的红色火焰的上空，在飘摇的浓烟和黑白相间的树桩的上空，在这些越来越少的莫洛克人的头顶上，终于出现了黎明的第一道曙光。</p> 
<p>“我再次寻找威娜，却不见她的踪影。很明显，他们把她可怜的尸体留在树林里了。我无法描述，想到她逃脱了似乎是命中注定的厄运，我有多么宽慰。不过想到这事，我几乎就忍不住想把我身边的这些无能为力的东西斩尽杀绝，可我还是克制住了自己。我说过，那小丘像是树林里的一个小岛。我现在站在小丘顶上可以透过烟雾辨认出青瓷殿了，从那里我就能找到白色斯芬克斯雕像的方向。于是，当天色渐渐亮起来的时候，我丢下这些残存下来的该死的鬼魂——他们仍然在东奔西撞，呜咽哀号——在脚上绑了些草，一瘸一拐地穿过烟雾腾腾的灰烬和里边还跳动着火焰的黑色树干，向藏着时间机器的地方走去。我走得很慢，因为我几乎已经精疲力竭，而且脚也破了。我为小威娜的惨死感到无限的悲伤，这好像是一场巨大的灾难。现在坐在这间熟悉的老屋里，它倒更像是梦中的悲痛，而不像是真的失去了亲人。但是那天早上，它再次使我感到极度孤独，孤独得叫我害怕。我开始思念我这间房子，这壁炉，思念你们几个人，伴随这思念之情而来的是一种痛苦的渴望。</p> 
<p>“可是，当我在早晨明朗的天空下走过余烟袅袅的灰烬时，我发现我的裤袋里还有几根零散的火柴。火柴盒肯定在丢失之前就已经漏了。”</p>
