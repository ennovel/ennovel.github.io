Four weeks' torture, tossing, and sickness! Oh! these bleak winds and bitter northern skies, and impassable roads, and dilatory country surgeons! And, oh, this dearth of the human physiognomy! and, worse than all, the terrible intimation of Kenneth that I need not expect to be out of doors till spring! </p> 
<p>Mr Heathcliff has just honoured me with a calls About seven days ago he sent me a brace of grouse--the last of the season. Scoundrel! He is not altogether guiltless in this illness of mine; and that I had a great mind to tell him. But, alas! how could I offend a man who was charitable enough to sit at my bedside a good hour, and talk on some other subject than pills and draughts, blisters and leeches? This is quite an easy interval. I am too weak to read; yet I feel as if I could enjoy something interesting. Why not have up Mrs Dean to finish her tale? I can recollect its chief incidents as far as she had gone. Yes: I remember her hero had run off, and never been heard of for three years; and the heroine was married. I'll ring: she'll be delighted to find me capable of talking cheerfully. Mrs Dean came. </p> 
<p>`It wants twenty minutes, sir, to taking the medicine,' she commenced. </p> 
<p>`Away, away with it!' I replied; `I desire to have---' </p> 
<p>`The doctor says you must drop the powders.' </p> 
<p>`With all my heart! Don't interrupt me. Come and take your seat here. Keep your fingers from that bitter phalanx of vials. Draw your knitting out of your pocket--that will do--now continue the history of Mr Heathcliff, from where you left off, to the present day. Did he finish his education on the Continent, and come back a gentleman? or. did he get a sizar's place at college, or escape to America, and earn honours by drawing blood from his foster-country? or make a fortune more promptly on the English highways?' </p> 
<p>`He may have done a little in all these vocations, Mr Lockwood; but I couldn't give my word for any. I stated before that I didn't know how he gained his money; neither am I aware of the means he took to raise his mind from the savage ignorance into which it was sunk: but, with your leave, I'll proceed in my own fashion, if you think it will amuse and not weary you. Are you feeling better this morning?' </p> 
<p>`Much.' </p> 
<p>`That's good news. I got Miss Catherine and myself to Thrushcross Grange; and, to my agreeable disappointment, she behaved infinitely better than I dared expect. She seemed almost over fond of Mr Linton; and even to his sister she showed plenty of affection. They were both very attentive to her comfort, certainly. It was not the thorn bending to the honeysuckles, but the honeysuckles embracing the thorn. There were no mutual concessions; one stood erect, and the others yielded: and who can be ill-natured and bad-tempered when they encounter neither opposition nor indifference? I observed that Mr Edgar had a deeprooted fear of ruffling her humour. He concealed it from her; but if ever he heard me answer sharply, or saw any other servant grow cloudy at some imperious order of hers, he would show his trouble by a frown of displeasure that never darkened on his own account. He many a time spoke sternly to me about my pertness; and averred that the stab of a knife could not inflict a worse pang than he suffered at seeing his lady vexed. Not to grieve a kind master, I learned to be less touchy; and, for the space of half a year, the gunpowder lay as harmless as sand, because no fire came near to explode it. Catherine had seasons of gloom and silence now and then: they were respected with sympathizing silence by her husband, who ascribed them to an alteration in her constitution, produced by her perilous illness; as she was never subject to depression of spirits before. The return of sunshine was welcomed by answering sunshine from him. I believe I may assert that they were really in possession of deep and growing happiness. </p> 
<p>It ended. Well, we must be for ourselves in the long run; the mild and generous are only more justly selfish than the domineering; and it ended when circumstances caused each to feel that the ones interest was not the chief consideration in the other's thoughts. On a mellow evening in September, I was coming from the garden with a heavy basket of apples which I had been gathering. It had got dusk, and the moon looked over the high wall of the court, causing undefined shadows to lurk in the corners of the numerous projecting portions of the building. I set my burden on the house steps by the kitchen door, and lingered to rest, and drew in a few more breaths of the soft, sweet air; my eyes were on the moon, and my back to the entrance, when I heard a voice behind me say-- </p> 
<p>`Nelly, is that you?' </p> 
<p>It was a deep voice, and foreign in tone; yet there was something in the manner of pronouncing my name which made it sound familiar. I turned about to discover who spoke, fearfully; for the doors were shut, and I had seen nobody on approaching the steps. Something stirred in the porch; and, moving nearer, I distinguished a tall man dressed in dark clothes, with dark face and hair. He leant against the side, and held his fingers on the latch as if intending to open for himself. `Who can it be?' I thought. `Mr Earnshaw? Oh, no! The voice has no resemblance to his.' </p> 
<p>`I have waited here an hour,' he resumed, while I continued staring; `and the whole of that time all round has been as still as death. I dared not enter. You do not know me? Look, I'm not a stranger!' </p> 
<p>A ray fell on his features; the cheeks were sallow, and half covered with black whiskers; the brows lowering, the eyes deep set and singular. I remembered the eyes. </p> 
<p>`What!' I cried, uncertain whether to regard him as a worldly visitor, and I raised my hands in amazement. What! you come back? Is it really you? Is it?' </p> 
<p>`Yes, Heathcliff,' he replied, glancing from me up to the windows, which reflected a score of glittering moons, but showed no lights from within. `Are they at home? where is she? Nelly, you are not glad! you needn't be so disturbed. Is she here? Speak! I want to have one word with her--your mistress. Go, and say some person from Gimmerton desires to see her.' </p> 
<p>`How will she take it?' I exclaimed. `What will she do? The surprise bewilders me--it will put her out of her head! And you are Heathcliff! But altered! Nay, there's no comprehending it. Have you been for a soldier?' </p> 
<p>`Go and carry my message,' he interrupted impatiently. `I'm in hell till you do!' </p> 
<p>He lifted the latch, and I entered; but when I got to the parlour where Mr and Mrs Linton were, I could not persuade myself to proceed. At length, I resolved on making an excuse to ask if they would have the candles lighted, and I opened the door. </p> 
<p>They sat together in a window whose lattice lay back against the wall, and displayed, beyond the garden trees and the wild green park, the valley of Gimmerton, with a long line of mist winding nearly to its top (for very soon after you pass the chapel, as you may have noticed, the sough that runs from the marshes joins a beck which follows the bend of the glen). Wuthering Heights rose above this silvery vapour; but our old house was invisible; it rather dips down on the other side. Both the room and its occupants, and the scene they gazed on, looked wondrously peaceful. I shrank reluctantly from performing my errand; and was actually going away leaving it unsaid, after having put my question about the candles, when a sense of my folly compelled me to return, and mutter--`A person from Gimmerton wishes to see you, ma'am.' </p> 
<p>`What does he want?' asked Mrs Linton. </p> 
<p>`I did not question him,' I answered. </p> 
<p>`Well, close the curtains, Nelly,' she said; `and bring up tea. I'll be back again directly.' </p> 
<p>She quitted the apartment; Mr Edgar inquired, carelessly, who it was. </p> 
<p>`Someone mistress does not expect,' I replied. `That Heathcliff--you recollect him, sir,--who used to live at Mr Earnshaw's.' </p> 
<p>`What! the gipsy--the ploughboy?' he cried. `Why did you not say so to Catherine?' </p> 
<p>`Hush! you must not call him by those names, master,' I said. `She'd be sadly grieved to hear you. She was nearly heartbroken when he ran off. I guess his return will make a jubilee to her.' </p> 
<p>Mr Linton walked to a window on the other side of the room that overlooked the court. He unfastened it and leant out. I suppose they were below, for he exclaimed quickly--`Don't stand there, love! Bring the person in, if it be anyone particular.' Ere long I heard the click of the latch, and Catherine flew upstairs, breathless and wild; too excited to show gladness: indeed, by her face, you would rather have surmised an awful calamity. </p> 
<p>`Oh, Edgar, Edgar!' she panted, flinging her arms round his neck. `Oh Edgar, darling! Heathcliff's come back-he is!' And she tightened her embrace to a squeeze. </p> 
<p>`Well, well,' cried her husband crossly, `don't strangle me for that! He never struck me as such a marvellous treasure. There is no need to be frantic!' </p> 
<p>`I know you didn't like him,' she answered, repressing a little the intensity of her delight. `Yet, for my sake, you must be friends now. Shall I tell him to come up?' </p> 
<p>`Here?' he said, `into the parlour?' </p> 
<p>`Where else?' she asked. </p> 
<p>He looked vexed, and suggested the kitchen as a more suitable place for him. Mrs Linton eyed him with a droll expression--half angry, half laughing at his fastidiousness. </p> 
<p>`No,' she added after a while; `I cannot sit in the kitchen. Set two tables here, Ellen: one for your master and Miss Isabella, being gentry; the other for Heathcliff and myself, being of the lower orders. Will that please you, dear? Or must I have a fire lighted elsewhere? If so, give directions. I'll run down and secure my guest. I'm afraid the joy is too great to be real!' </p> 
<p>She was about to dart off again; but Edgar arrested her. </p> 
<p>`You bid him step up,' he said, addressing me! `and, Catherine, try to be glad, without being absurd! the whole household need not witness the sight of your welcoming a runaway servant as a brother.' </p> 
<p>I descended and found Heathcliff waiting under the porch, evidently anticipating an invitation to enter. He followed my guidance without waste of words, and I ushered him into the presence of the master and mistress, whose flushed cheeks betrayed signs of warm talking. But the lady's glowed with another feeling when her friend appeared at the door: she sprang forward, took both his hands, and led him to Linton; and then she seized Linton's reluctant fingers and crushed them into his. Now fully revealed by the fire and candlelight, I was amazed, more than ever, to behold the transformation of Heathcliff. He had grown a tall, athletic, well-formed man; beside whom, my master seemed quite slender and youth-like. His upright carriage suggested the idea of his having been in the army. His countenance was much older in expression and decision of feature than Mr Linton's; it looked intelligent, and retained no marks of former degradation. A half-civilized ferocity lurked yet in the depressed brows and eyes full of black fire, but it was subdued; and his manner was even dignified: quite divested of roughness, though too stern for grace. My master's surprise equalled or exceeded mine: he remained for a minute at a loss how to address the ploughboy, as he had called him. Heathcliff dropped his slight hand, and stood looking at him coolly till he chose to speak. </p> 
<p>`Sit down, sir,' he said, at length. `Mrs Linton, recalling old times, would have me give you a cordial reception; and, of course, I am gratified when anything occurs to please her.' </p> 
<p>`And I also,' answered Heathcliff, `especially if it be anything in which I have a part. I shall stay an hour or two willingly.' </p> 
<p>He took a seat opposite Catherine, who kept her gaze fixed on him as if she feared he would vanish were she to remove it. He did not raise his to her often: a quick glance now and then sufficed; but it flashed back, each time more confidently, the undisguised delight he drank from hers. They were too much absorbed in their mutual joy to suffer embarrassment. Not so Mr Edgar: he grew pale with pure annoyance: a feeling that reached its climax when his lady rose, and stepping across the rug, seized Heathcliff's hands again, and laughed like one beside herself. </p> 
<p>`I shall think it a dream tomorrow!' she cried. `I shall not be able to believe that I have seen, and touched, and spoken to you once more. And yet, cruel Heathcliff! you don't deserve this welcome. To be absent and silent for three years, and never to think of me!' </p> 
<p>`A little more than you have thought of me,' he murmured. `I heard of your marriage, Cathy, not long since; and, while waiting in the yard below, I meditated this plan:--just to have one glimpse of your face, a stare of surprise, perhaps, and pretended pleasure; afterwards settle my score with Hindley; and then prevent the law by doing execution on myself. Your welcome has put these ideas out of my mind; but beware of meeting me with another aspect next time! Nay, you'll not drive me off again. You were really sorry for me, were you? Well, there was cause. I've fought through a bitter life since I last heard your voice; and you must forgive me, for I struggled only for you!' </p> 
<p>`Catherine, unless we are to have cold tea, please to come to the table,' interrupted Linton, striving to preserve his ordinary tone, and a due measure of politeness. `Mr Heathcliff will have a long walk, wherever he may lodge tonight; and I'm thirsty.' </p> 
<p>She took her post before the urn; and Miss Isabella came, summoned by the bell; then, having handed their chairs forward, I left the room. The meal hardly endured ten minutes. Catherine's cup was never filled: she could neither eat nor drink. Edgar had made a slop in his saucer, and scarcely swallowed a mouthful. Their guest did not protract his stay that evening above an hour longer. I asked, as he departed, if he went to Gimmerton? </p> 
<p>`No, to Wuthering Heights,' he answered: `Mr Earnshaw invited me, when I called this morning.' </p> 
<p>Mr Earnshaw invited him! and he called on Mr Earnshaw! I pondered this sentence painfully, after he was gone. Is he turning out a bit of a hypocrite, and coming into the country to work mischief under a cloak? I mused: I had a presentiment in the bottom of my heart that he had better have remained away. </p> 
<p>About the middle of the night, I was wakened from my first nap by Mrs Linton gliding into my chamber, taking a seat on my bedside, and pulling me by the hair to rouse me. </p> 
<p>`I cannot rest, Ellen,' she said, by way of apology. `And I want some living creature to keep me company in my happiness! Edgar is sulky, because I'm glad of a thing that does not interest him: he refuses to open his mouth, except to utter pettish, silly speeches; and he affirmed I was cruel and selfish for wishing to talk when he was so sick and sleepy. He always contrives to be sick at the least cross! I gave a few sentences of commendation to Heathcliff, and he, either for a headache or a pang of envy, began to cry: so I got up and left him.' </p> 
<p>`What use is it praising Heathcliff to him?' I answered. `As lads they had an aversion to each other, and Heathcliff would hate just as much to hear him praised: it's human nature. Let Mr Linton alone about him, unless you would like an open quarrel between them.' </p> 
<p>`But does it not show great weakness?' pursued she. `I'm not envious: I never feel hurt at the brightness of Isabella's yellow hair and the whiteness of her skin, at her dainty elegance, and the fondness all the family exhibit for her. Even you, Nelly, if we have a dispute sometimes, you back Isabella at once; and I yield like a foolish mother: I call her a darling, and flatter her into a good temper. It pleases her brother to see us cordial, and that pleases me. But they are very much alike: they are spoiled children, and fancy the world was made for their accommodation; and though I humour both, I think a smart chastisement might improve them, all the same.' </p> 
<p>`You're mistaken, Mrs Linton,' said I. `They humour you: I know what there would be to do if they did not. You can well afford to indulge their passing whims as long as their business is to anticipate all your desires. You may, however, fall out, at last, over something of equal consequence to both sides; and then those you term weak are very capable of being as obstinate as you.' </p> 
<p>`And then we shall fight to the death, shan't we, Nelly?' she returned, laughing. `No! I tell you, I have such faith in Linton's love, that I believe I might kill him, and he wouldn't wish to retaliate.' </p> 
<p>I advised her to value him the more for his affection. </p> 
<p>`I do,' she answered, `but he needn't resort to whining for trifles. It is childish; and, instead of melting into tears because I said that Heathcliff was now worthy of anyone's regard, and it would honour the first gentleman in the country to be his friend, he ought to have said it for me, and been delighted from sympathy. He must get accustomed to him, and he may as well like him: considering how Heathcliff has reason to object to him, I'm sure he behaved excellently!' </p> 
<p>`What do you think of his going to Wuthering Heights?' I inquired. `He is reformed in every respect, apparently: quite a Christian: offering the right hand of fellowship to his enemies all around!' </p> 
<p>`He explained it,' she replied. `I wondered as much as you. He said he called to gather information concerning me from you, supposing you resided there still; and Joseph told Hindley, who came out and fell to questioning him of what he had been doing, and how he had been living; and finally, desired him to walk in. There were some persons sitting at cards; Heathcliff joined them; my brother lost some money to him, and, finding him plentifully supplied, he requested that he would come again in the evening: to which he consented. Hindley is too reckless to select his acquaintance prudently: he doesn't trouble himself to reflect on the causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has basely injured. But Heathcliff affirms his principal reason for resuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a wish to install himself in quarters at walking distance from the Grange, and an attachment to the house where we lived together; and likewise a hope that I shall have more opportunities of seeing him there than I could have if he settled in Gimmerton. He means to offer liberal payment for permission to lodge at the Heights; and doubtless my brother's covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms: he was always greedy; though what he grasps with one hand he flings away with the other.' </p> 
<p>`It's a nice place for a young man to fix his dwelling in!' said I. `Have you no fear of the consequences, `Mrs Linton?' </p> 
<p>`None for my friend,' she replied: `his strong head will keep him from danger; a little for Hindley: but he can't be made morally worse than he is; and I stand between him and bodily harm. The event of this evening has reconciled me to God and humanity! I had risen in angry rebellion against Providence. Oh, I've endured very, very bitter misery, Nelly! If that creature knew how bitter, he'd be ashamed to cloud its removal with idle petulance. It was kindness for him which induced me to bear it alone: had I expressed the agony I frequently felt, he would have been taught to long for its alleviation as ardently as l. However, it's over, and I'll take no revenge on his folly; I can afford to suffer anything hereafter! Should the meanest thing alive slap me on the cheek, I'd not only turn the other, but, I'd ask pardon for provoking it; and, as a proof, I'll go make my peace with Edgar instantly. Good night! I'm an angel!' </p> 
<p>In this self-complacent conviction she departed; and the success of her fulfilled resolution was obvious on the morrow: Mr Linton had not only abjured his peevishness (though his spirits seemed still subdued by Catherine's exuberance of vivacity), but he ventured no objection to her taking Isabella with her to Wuthering Heights in the afternoon; and she rewarded him with such a summer of sweetness and affection in return, as made the house a paradise for several days; both master and servants profiting from the perpetual sunshine. </p> 
<p>Heathcliff--Mr Heathcliff I should say in future--used the liberty of visiting at Thrushcross Grange cautiously, at first: he seemed estimating how far its owner would bear his intrusion. Catherine, also, deemed it judicious to moderate her expressions of pleasure in receiving him; and he gradually established his right to be expected. He retained a great deal of the reserve for which his boyhood was remarkable; and that served to repress all startling demonstrations of feeling. My master's uneasiness experienced a lull, and further circumstances diverted it into another channel for a space. </p> 
<p>His new source of trouble sprang from the not anticipated misfortune of Isabella Linton evincing a sudden and irresistible attraction towards the tolerated guest. She was at that time a charming young lady of eighteen; infantile in manners, though possessed of keen wit, keen feelings, and a keen temper, too, if irritated. Her brother, who loved her tenderly, was appalled at this fantastic preference. Leaving aside the degradation of an alliance with a nameless man, and the possible fact that his property, in default of heirs male, might pass into such a one's power, he had sense to comprehend Heathcliff's disposition: to know that, though his exterior was altered, his mind was unchangeable and unchanged. And he dreaded that mind: it revolted him: he shrank forebodingly from the idea of committing Isabella to his keeping. He would have recoiled still more had he been aware that her attachment rose unsolicited, and was bestowed where it awakened no reciprocation of sentiment; for the minute he discovered its existence, he laid the blame on Heathcliff's deliberate designing. </p> 
<p>We had all remarked, during some time, that Miss Linton fretted and pined over something. She grew cross and wearisome; snapping at and teasing Catherine continually, at the imminent risk of exhausting her limited patience. We excused her, to a certain extent, on the plea of ill-health: she was dwindling and fading before our eyes. But one day, when she had been peculiarly wayward, rejecting her breakfast, complaining that the servants did not do what she told them; that the mistress would allow her to be nothing in the house, and Edgar neglected her; that she had caught a cold with the doors being left open, and we let the parlour fire go out on purpose to vex her, with a hundred yet more frivolous accusations, Mrs Linton peremptorily insisted that she should get to bed; and, having scolded her heartily, threatened to send for the doctor. Mention of Kenneth caused her to exclaim, instantly, that her health was perfect, and it was only Catherine's harshness which made her unhappy. </p> 
<p>`How can you say I am harsh, you naughty fondling?' cried the mistress, amazed at the unreasonable assertion. `You are surely losing your reason. When have I been harsh, tell me?' </p> 
<p>`Yesterday,' sobbed Isabella, `and now!' </p> 
<p>`Yesterday!' said her sister-in-law. `On what occasion?' </p> 
<p>`In our walk along the moor: you told me to ramble where I pleased, while you sauntered on with Mr Heathcliff!' </p> 
<p>`And that's your notion of harshness?' said Catherine, laughing. `It was no hint that your company was superfluous: we didn't care whether you kept with us or not; I merely thought Heathcliffs talk would have nothing entertaining for your ears. </p> 
<p>`Oh no,' wept the young lady; `you wished me away, because you knew I liked to be there!' </p> 
<p>`Is she sane?' asked Mrs Linton, appealing to me. `I'll repeat our conversation, word for word, Isabella; and you point out any charm it could have had for you.' </p> 
<p>`I don't mind the conversation,' she answered: `I wanted to be with---' </p> 
<p>`Well!' said Catherine, perceiving her hesitate to complete the sentence. </p> 
<p>`With him: and I won't be always sent off!' she continued, kindling up. `You are a dog in the manger, Cathy, and desire no one to be loved but yourself!' </p> 
<p>`You are an impertinent little monkey!' exclaimed Mrs Linton, in surprise. `But I'll not believe this idiocy! It is impossible that you can covet the admiration of Heathcliff--that you consider him an agreeable person! I hope I have misunderstood you, Isabella?' </p> 
<p>`No, you have not,' said the infatuated girl. `I love him more than ever you loved Edgar; and he might love me, if you would let him!' </p> 
<p>`I wouldn't be you for a kingdom, then!' Catherine declared emphatically: and she seemed to speak sincerely. `Nelly, help me to convince her of her madness. Tell her what Heathcliff is: an unreclaimed creature, without refinement, without cultivation: an arid wilderness of furze and whinstone. I'd as soon put that little canary into the park on a winter's day, as recommend you to bestow your heart on him! It is deplorable ignorance of his character, child, and nothing else, which makes that dream enter your head. Pray, don't imagine that he conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior! He's not a rough diamond--a pearl-containing oyster of a rustic: he's a fierce, pitiless, wolfish man. I never say to him, "Let this or that enemy alone, because it would be ungenerous or cruel to harm them"; I say, "Let them alone, because I should hate them to be wronged": and he'd crush you like a sparrow's egg, Isabella, if he found you a troublesome charge. I know he couldn't love a Linton; and yet he'd be quite capable of marrying your fortune and expectations! avarice is growing with him a besetting sin. There's my picture: and I'm his friend--so much so, that had he thought seriously to catch you, I should, perhaps, have held my tongue, and let you fall into his trap.' </p> 
<p>Miss Linton regarded her sister-in-law with indignation. </p> 
<p>`For shame! for shame!' she repeated angrily, `you are worse than twenty foes, you poisonous friend!' </p> 
<p>`Ah! you won't believe me, then?' said Catherine. `You think I speak from wicked selfishness?' </p> 
<p>`I'm certain you do,' retorted Isabella; `and I shudder at you!' </p> 
<p>`Good!' cried the other. `Try for yourself, if that be your spirit: I have done, and yield the argument to your saucy insolence.' </p> 
<p>`And I must suffer for her egotism!' she sobbed, as Mrs Linton left the room. `All, all is against me; she has blighted my single consolation. But she uttered falsehoods, didn't she? Mr Heathcliff is not a fiend: he has an honourable soul, and a true one, or how could he remember her?' </p> 
<p>`Banish him from your thoughts, miss,' I said. `He's a bird of bad omen: no mate for you. Mrs Linton spoke strongly, and yet I can't contradict her. She is better acquainted with his heart than I, or anyone besides; and she would never represent him as worse than he is. Honest people don't hide their deeds. How has he been living? how has he got rich? why is he staying at Wuthering Heights, the house of a man whom he abhors? They say Mr Earnshaw is worse and worse since he came. They sit up all night together continually, and Hindley has been borrowing money on his land, and does nothing but play and drink: I heard only a week ago--it was Joseph who told me--I met him at Gimmerton: "Nelly," he said, "we's hae a crahnr's `quest enah, at ahr folks. One on `em's a'most getten his finger cut off wi' hauding t'other froo' sticking hisseln loike a cawlf. That's maister, yah knaw, `ut's soa up uh going tuh t' grand `sizes. He's noan feard uh t' bench uh judges, norther Paul, nur Peter, nur John, nur Matthew, nor noan on `em, nut he! He fair likes--he langs to set his brazened face agean `em! And yon bonny lad Heathcliff, yah mind, he's a rare `un! He can girn a laugh as weel's onybody at a raight divil's jest. Does he niver say nowt of his fine living amang us, when he goas tuh t' Grange? This is t' way on't:--up at sundahn; dice, brandy, cloised shutters, und can'le-lught till next day at nooin: then, t fooil gangs banning un raving to his cham'er, makking dacent fowks dig thur fingers i' thur lugs fur varry shaume; un' the knave, wah he carn cahnt his brass, un' ate, un' sleep, un' off to his neighbour's tuh gossip wi' t' wife. I' course, he tells Dame Catherine hah hor father's goold runs intuh his pocket, and her father's son gallops dahn t' Broad road, while he flees afore to oppen t' pikes?" Now, Miss Linton, Joseph is an old rascal, but no liar; and, if his account of Heathcliff's conduct be true, you would never think of desiring such a husband, would you?' </p> 
<p>`You are leagued with the rest, Ellen!' she replied. `I'll not listen to your slanders. What malevolence you must have to wish to convince me that there is no happiness in the world!' </p> 
<p>Whether she would have got over this fancy if left to herself or persevered in nursing it perpetually, I cannot say: she had little time to reflect. The day after, there was a justice-meeting at the next town; my master was obliged to attend; and Mr Heathcliff, aware of his absence, called rather earlier than usual. Catherine and Isabella were sitting in the library, on hostile terms, but silent. The latter alarmed at her recent indiscretion, and the disclosure she had made of her secret feelings in a transient fit of passion; the former, on mature consideration, really offended with her companion; and, if she laughed again at her pertness, inclined to make it no laughing matter to her. She did laugh as she saw Heathcliff pass the window. I was sweeping the hearth, and I noticed a mischievous smile on her lips. Isabella, absorbed in her meditations, or a book, remained till the door opened; and it was too late to attempt an escape, which she would gladly have done had it been practicable. </p> 
<p>`Come in, that's right!' exclaimed the mistress gaily, pulling a chair to the fire. `Here are two people sadly in need of a third to thaw the ice between them; and you are the very one we should both of us choose. Heathcliff, I'm proud to show you, at last, somebody that dotes on you more than myself. I expect you to feel flattered. Nay, it's not Nelly; don't look at her! My poor little sister-in-law is breaking her heart by mere contemplation of your physical and moral beauty. It lies in your own power to be Edgar's brother! No, no, Isabella, you shan't run off,' she continued, arresting, with feigned playfulness, the confounded girl, who had risen indignantly. `We were quarrelling like cats about you, Heathcliff; and I was fairly beaten in protestations of devotion and admiration: and, moreover, I was informed that if I would but have the manners to stand aside, my rival, as she will ha"e herself to be, would shoot a shaft into your soul that would fix you for ever, and send my image into eternal oblivion!' </p> 
<p>`Catherine!' said Isabella, calling up her dignity, and disdaining to struggle from the tight grasp that held her. `I'd thank you to adhere to the truth and not slander me, even in joke! Mr Heathcliff, be kind enough to bid this friend of yours release me: she forgets that you and I are not intimate acquaintances; and what amuses her is painful to me beyond expression.' </p> 
<p>As the guest answered nothing, but took his seat, and looked thoroughly indifferent what sentiments she cherished concerning him, she turned and whispered an earnest appeal for liberty to her tormentor. </p> 
<p>`By no means!' cried Mrs Linton in answer. `I won't be named a dog in the manger again. You shall stay: now then! Heathcliff, why don't you evince satisfaction at my pleasant news? Isabella swears that the love Edgar has for me is nothing to that she entertains for you. I'm sure she made some speech of the kind; did she not, Ellen? And she has fasted ever since the day before yesterday's walk, from sorrow and rage that I dispatched her out of your society under the idea of its being unacceptable. </p> 
<p>`I think you belie her,' said Heathcliff, twisting his chair to face them. `She wishes to be out of my society now, at any rate!' And he stared hard at the object of discourse, as one might do at a strange repulsive animal: a centipede from the Indies, for instance, which curiosity leads one to examine in spite of the aversion it raises. The poor thing couldn't bear that: she grew white and red in rapid succession, and, while tears beaded her lashes, bent the strength of her small fingers to loosen the firm clutch of Catherine; and perceiving that as fast as she raised one finger off her arm another closed down, and she could not remove the whole together, she began to make use of her nails; and their sharpness presently ornamented the detainer's with crescents of red. </p> 
<p>`There's a tigress!' exclaimed Mrs Linton, setting her free, and shaking her hand with pain. `Begone, for God's sake, and hide your vixen face! How foolish to reveal those talons to him. Can't you fancy the conclusions he'll draw? Look, Heathcliff! they are instruments that will do execution--you must beware of your eyes. </p> 
<p>`I'd wrench them off her fingers, if they ever menaced me,' he answered brutally, when the door had closed after her. `But what did you mean by teasing the creature in that manner, Cathy? You were not speaking the truth, were you?' </p> 
<p>`I assure you I was,' she returned. `She has been pining for your sake several weeks; and raving about you this morning, and pouring forth a deluge of abuse, because I represented your failings in a plain light, for the purpose of mitigating her adoration. But don't notice it further: I wished to punish her sauciness, that's all. I like her too well, my dear Heathcliff, to let you absolutely seize and devour her up.' </p> 
<p>`And I like her too ill to attempt it,' said he, `except in a very ghoulish fashion. You'd hear of odd things if I lived alone with that mawkish, waxen face: the most ordinary would be painting on its white the colours of the rainbow, and turning the blue eyes black, every day or two: they detestably resemble Linton's.' </p> 
<p>`Delectably!' observed Catherine. `They are dove's eyes--angel's!' </p> 
<p>`She's her brother's heir, is she not?' he asked, after a brief silence. </p> 
<p>`I should be sorry to think so,' returned his companion. `Half a dozen nephews shall erase her title, please Heaven! Abstract your mind from the subject at present: you are too prone to covet your neighbour's goods; remember this neighbour's goods are mine.' </p> 
<p>`If they were mine, they would be none the less that,' said Heathcliff; `but though Isabella Linton may be silly, she is scarcely mad; and, in short, we'll dismiss the matter, as you advise.' </p> 
<p>From their tongues they did dismiss it; and Catherine, probably, from her thoughts. The other, I felt certain, recalled it often in the course of the evening. I saw him smile to himself--grin rather--and lapse into ominous musing whenever Mrs Linton had occasion to be absent from the apartment. </p> 
<p>I determined to watch his movements. My heart invariably cleaved to the master's, in preference to Catherine's side: with reason I imagined, for he was kind, and trustful, and honourable; and she--she could not be called the opposite, yet she seemed to allow herself such wide latitude, that I had little faith in her principles, and still less sympathy for her feelings. I wanted something to happen which might have the effect of freeing both Wuthering Heights and the Grange of Mr Heathcliff, quietly; leaving us as we had been prior to his advent. His visits were a continual nightmare to me; and, I suspected, to my master also. His abode at the Heights was an oppression past explaining. I felt that God had forsaken the stray sheep there to its own wicked wanderings, and an evil beast prowled between it and the fold, waiting his time to spring and destroy.</p>  
<p>希刺克厉夫先生刚刚光临来看了我。大概在七天以前他送我一对松鸡——这是这季节的最后两只了。坏蛋！我这场病，他可不是全然没有责任的，我很想这样告诉他。可是，唉呀！这个人真够慈悲，坐在我床边足足一个钟点。谈了一些别的题目，而不谈药片、药水、药膏治疗之类的内容，那么我怎么能得罪他呢？这倒是一段舒适的休养时期。我还太弱，没法读书，但是我觉得我仿佛能够享受一点有趣的东西了。为什么不把丁太太叫上来讲完她的故事呢？我还能记得她所讲到的主要情节。是的，我记得她的男主角跑掉了，而且三年杳无音讯；而女主角结婚了。我要拉铃。我要是发现我已经能够愉快地聊天，一定会高兴的。丁太太来了。 </p> 
<p>“先生，还要等二十分钟才吃药哩，”她开始说。 </p> 
<p>“去吧，去它的！”我回答，“我想要——” </p> 
<p>“医生说你必须服药粉了。” </p> 
<p>“我满心愿意，不要打扰我。过来，坐在这儿。不要碰那一排苦药瓶。把你的毛线活从口袋里拿出来——好啦——现在接着讲希刺克厉夫先生的历史吧，从你打住的地方讲到现在。他是不是在欧洲大陆上完成他的教育，变成一个绅士回来了？或是他在大学里得到了半工半读的免费生的位置？或者逃到美洲去，从他的第二祖国那儿吸取膏血而获得了名望？或者更干脆些在英国公路上打劫发了财？” </p> 
<p>“也许这些职业他都干过一点，洛克乌德先生，可是我说不出他究竟干了什么，我声明过我不知道他怎么搞到钱的！我也不明白他用什么方法把他本来沉入野蛮无知的心灵救出来的。但是，对不起，如果你认为能让你高兴而不烦扰你，我就要用我自己的方式讲下去了。你今天早上觉得好点吗？” </p> 
<p>“好多了。” </p> 
<p>“好消息。” </p> 
<p>我带着凯瑟琳小姐一起到了画眉田庄。虽然失望，然而足以欣慰的是她的举止好多了，这是我当初简直不敢想的。看来她几乎过于喜爱林惇先生了，甚至对他的妹妹，她也表现出十分亲热。当然，他们两个对她的舒适也非常关怀。并不是荆棘倒向忍冬①，而是忍冬拥抱荆棘。并没有双方互相让步的事，一个站得笔直，其他的人就都得顺从。既遭不到反对，又遭不到冷淡，谁还能使坏性子发脾气呢？我看出埃德加先生是生怕惹她发怒。他掩饰着这种惧怕不让她知道；可是当她有什么蛮不讲理的吩咐时，他若一听见我答话声气硬些，或是看见别的仆人不太乐意时，他就皱起眉头表示生气了，而他为了自己的事从来不沉下脸的。他几次很严厉地对我说起我的不懂规矩；而且肯定说那怕用一把小刀戳他一下，也抵不上看见他的夫人烦恼时那么难受。我不要让一位仁慈的主人难过，我就得学着克制些。而且，有半年时间，这火药像沙土一样地摆在那儿并没引爆，因为没有火凑近来使它爆炸。凯瑟琳时不时地也有阴郁和沉默的时候，她的丈夫便以同情的沉默，以表示尊重。他认为这是由于她那场危险的病所引起的体质上的变化，因为她以前从来没有过心情抑郁的时候。她如现出阳光重返的神气，他这边也就现出阳光重返来表示欢迎。我相信我可以说他们真的得到深沉的、与日俱增的幸福了。 </p> 
<p>①忍冬——honeysuckle，半常绿罐木，茎蔓生，初夏开白花，有香气，叶花可入药，俗名金银花。 </p> 
<p>幸福完结了。唉，到头来我们总归是为了自己；温和慷慨的人不过比傲慢霸道的人自私得稍微公平一点罢了，等到种种情况使得两个人都感觉到一方的利益并不是对方思想中主要关心的事物的时候，幸福就完结了。九月里一个醉人的傍晚，我挎着一大篮才采下来的苹果从花园出来。那时已经快黑了，月亮从院子的高墙外照过来，照出一些模糊的阴影，潜藏在这房子的无数突出部分的角落里。我把我这篮东西放在厨房门口的台阶上，站一站，休息一会，再吸几口柔和甜美的空气，我抬眼望着月亮，背朝着大门，这时我听见我背后有个声音说： </p> 
<p>“耐莉，是你吗？” </p> 
<p>那是个深沉的声音，又是外地口音，可是唸我的名字又唸得让人听了怪熟悉的。我害怕地转过来看看倒是谁在说话，因为门是关着的，我又没看见有人上台阶。在门廊里有个什么东西在动。而且，正在走近，我看出是个高高的人，穿着黑衣服，有张黑黑的脸，还有黑头发。他斜靠在屋边，手指握着门闩，好像打算自己要开门似的。 </p> 
<p>“能是谁呢？”我想着。“恩萧先生吗？啊，不是！声音不像他的。” </p> 
<p>“我已经等了一个钟头了，”就在我还发愣的当儿他又说了，“我等的时候，四周一直像死一样的静。我不敢进去。你不认识我了吗？瞧瞧，我不是生人呀！” </p> 
<p>一道光线照在他的脸上：两颊苍白，一半为黑胡须所盖，眉头低耸，眼睛深陷而且很特别。我记起这对眼睛了。 </p> 
<p>“什么！”我叫道，不能确定是把他当作人，还是鬼。我惊讶地举起双手。“什么！你回来啦？真是你吗？是你吗？” </p> 
<p>“是啊，希刺克厉夫，”他回答，从我身上抬眼看一下窗户，那儿映照出灿烂的月亮，却没有灯光从里面射出来。“他们在家吗——她在哪儿？耐莉，你在不高兴——你用不着这么惊慌呀！她在这儿吗？说呀！我要跟她说一句话——你的女主人。去吧，说有人从吉默吞来想见见她。” </p> 
<p>“她怎么接受这消息呢？”我喊起来，“她会怎么办呢？这件意外的事真让我为难——这会让她昏了头的！你是希刺克厉夫！可是变啦！不，简直没法让人明白，你当过兵了吧？” </p> 
<p>“去吧，送我的口信去。”他不耐烦地打断了我的问话。 </p> 
<p>“你不去，我就等于在地狱里！” </p> 
<p>他抬起门闩，我进去了。可是当我走到林惇先生和夫人所在的客厅那儿，我没法让自己向前走了。终于，我决定借口问他们要不要点蜡烛，我就开了门。 </p> 
<p>他们一起坐在窗前，格子窗拉开，抵在墙上，望出去，除了花园的树木与天然的绿色园林之外，还可以看见吉默吞山谷，有一长条白雾简直都快环绕到山顶上（因为你过了教堂不久，也许会注意到，从旷野里吹来的燃燃微风，正吹动着一条弯弯曲曲顺着狭谷流去的小溪）。呼啸山庄耸立在这银色的雾气上面，但是却看不见我们的老房子——那是偏在山的另一面的。这屋子和屋里的人，以及他们凝视着的景致，都显得非常安谧。我畏畏缩缩不情愿执行我的使命，问过点灯的话后，实际上差点不说话就走开，这时意识到我的傻念头，就又迫使我回来，低声说： </p> 
<p>“从吉默吞来了一个人想见你，夫人。” </p> 
<p>“他有什么事？”林惇夫人问。 </p> 
<p>“我没问他，”我回答。 </p> 
<p>“好吧，放下窗帘，耐莉，”她说，“端茶来，我马上就回来。” </p> 
<p>她离开了这间屋子。埃德加先生不经意地问问是谁。 </p> 
<p>“是太太没想到的人，”我回答，“就是那个希刺克厉夫——你记得他吧，先生——他原来住在恩萧先生家的。” </p> 
<p>“什么！那个吉普赛——是那个乡巴佬吗？”他喊起来。 </p> 
<p>“你为什么不告诉凯瑟琳呢？” </p> 
<p>“嘘！你千万别这么叫他，主人，”我说。“她要是听见的话，她会很难过的。他跑掉的时候她几乎心碎了，我猜他这次回来对她可是件大喜事呢。” </p> 
<p>林惇先生走到屋子那边一个可以望见院子的窗户前，他打开窗户，向外探身。我猜他们就在下面，因为他马上喊起来了： </p> 
<p>“别站在那儿，亲爱的！要是贵客，就把他带进来吧。” </p> 
<p>没有多久，我听见门闩响，凯瑟琳飞奔上楼，上气不接下气，心慌意乱，兴奋得不知该怎么表现她的欢喜了：的确，只消看她的脸，你反而要猜疑将有什么大难临头似的。 </p> 
<p>“啊，埃德加，埃德加！”她喘息着，搂着他的脖子。“啊，埃德加，亲爱的！希刺克厉夫回来啦——他是回来啦！”她拚命地搂住他。 </p> 
<p>“好啦，好啦。”她丈夫烦恼地叫道，“不要为了这个就要把我勒死啦！我从来没有想到他是这么一个稀奇的宝贝。用不着高兴得发疯呀！” </p> 
<p>“我知道你过去不喜欢他。”她回答，稍微把她那种强烈的喜悦抑制了一些。“可是为了我的缘故，你们现在非作朋友不可。我叫他上来好吗？” </p> 
<p>“这里？”他说，“到客厅里来么？” </p> 
<p>“不到这儿还到哪儿呢？”她问。 </p> 
<p>他显得怪难为情的，绕着弯儿说厨房对他还比较合适些。 </p> 
<p>林惇夫人带着一种诙谐的表情瞅着他——对于他的苛求是又好气又好笑。 </p> 
<p>“不！”过了一会她又说：“我不能坐在厨房里。在这儿摆两张桌子吧，艾伦，一张给你主人和伊莎贝拉小姐用，他们是有门第的上等人；另一张给希刺克厉夫和我自己，我们是属于下等阶级的。那样可以使你高兴吧，亲爱的？或是我必须在别的地方生个火呢？如果是这样，下命令吧。我要跑下楼陪我的客人了。我真怕这场欢喜太大了，也许不会是真的吧！” </p> 
<p>她正要再冲出去，可是埃德加把她拦住了。 </p> 
<p>“你叫他上来吧。”他对我说：“还有，凯瑟琳，尽管欢喜可别做得荒唐！用不着让全家人都看着你把一个逃亡的仆人当作一个兄弟似的欢迎。” </p> 
<p>我下楼发现希刺克厉夫在门廊下等着，显然是预料要请他进来。他没有多说话就随着我进来了。我引他到主人和女主人面前，他们发红的脸还露出激辩的痕迹。但是当她的朋友在门口出现时，夫人的脸上闪着另一种情感。她跳上前去，拉着他的双手，领他到林惇这儿。然后她抓住林惇不情愿伸出来的手指硬塞到他的手里。这时我借着炉火和烛光，越发惊异地看见希刺克厉夫变了样。他已经长成了一个高高的、强壮的、身材很好的人；在他旁边，我的主人显得瘦弱，像个少年。他十分笔挺的仪表使人想到他一定进过军队，他的面容在表情上和神色上都比林惇先生老成果断多了：那副面容看来很有才智，并没有留下从前低贱的痕迹。一种半开化的野性还潜伏在那凹下的眉毛和那充满了黑黑的火焰的眼睛里，但是已经被克制住了。他的举止简直是庄重，不带一点粗野，然而严峻有余，文雅不足。我主人的惊奇跟我一样，或者还超过了我，他呆在那儿有一分钟之久，不知该怎样招呼这个他所谓的乡巴佬。希刺克厉夫放下他那瘦瘦的手，冷静地站在那儿望着他，等他先开口。 </p> 
<p>“坐下吧，先生。”他终于说：“想起往日，林惇夫人要我诚意地接待你。当然，凡是能使她开心的任何事情，我都是很高兴去做的。” </p> 
<p>“我也是。”希刺克厉夫回答。“特别是那种如果有我参加的事情，我将很愿意待一两个钟头。” </p> 
<p>他在凯瑟琳对面的一张椅子上坐下来，她一直盯着他，唯恐她若不看他，他就会消失似的。他不大抬眼看她，只是时不时地很快地瞥一眼。可是这种偷看，每一次都带回他从她眼中所汲取的那种毫不掩饰的喜悦，越来越满不在乎了。他们过于沉浸在相互欢乐里，一点儿不觉得窘。埃德加先生可不这样，他满心烦恼而脸色苍白。当他的夫人站起来，走过地毯，又抓住希刺克厉夫的手，而只大笑得忘形的时候，这种感觉就达到顶点了。 </p> 
<p>“明天我要以为这是一场梦哩！”她叫道：“我不能够相信我又看见了你，摸到你，而且还跟你说了话。可是，狠心的希刺克厉夫！你不配受这个欢迎。一去三年没有音信，从来没想到我！” </p> 
<p>“比你想到我可还多一点呢。”他低声说：“凯蒂，不久以前，我才听说你结婚了。我在下面院子等你的时候，我打算——只看一下你的脸——也许是惊奇地瞅一下，而且假装高兴，然后就去跟辛德雷算帐。再就自杀以避免法律的制裁。你的欢迎把我这些念头都赶掉了，可是当心下一回不要用另一种神气与我相见啊！不，你不会再赶走我了——你曾经真为我难过的，是吧？嗯，说来话长。自从我最后听见你说话的声音之后，我总算苦熬过来了，你必须原谅我，因为我只是为了你才奋斗的！” </p> 
<p>“凯瑟琳，除非我们是要喝冷茶，不然就请到桌子这儿来吧。”林惇打断说，努力保持他平常的声调，以及相当程度的礼貌。“希刺克厉夫先生无论今晚住在哪里，也还得走段长路，而且我也渴了。” </p> 
<p>她走到茶壶前面的座位上，伊莎贝拉小姐也被铃声召唤来了。然后，我把他们的椅子向前推好，就离开了这间屋子。这顿茶也没有超过十分钟。凯瑟琳的茶杯根本没倒上茶：她吃不下，也喝不下。埃德加倒了一些在他的碟子里，也咽不下一口。那天晚上他们的客人逗留不到一个钟头。他临走时，我问他是不是到吉默吞去？ </p> 
<p>“不，到呼啸山庄去，”他回答。“今天早上我去拜访时，恩萧先生请我去住的。” </p> 
<p>恩萧先生请他！他拜访恩萧先生！在他走后，我苦苦地思索着这句话。他变得有点像伪君子了，乔装改扮了到乡间来害人吗？我冥想着——在我的心底有一种预感，他若是一直留在外乡，那还好些。 </p> 
<p>大约在夜半，我才打盹没多会儿，就被林惇夫人弄醒了，她溜到我卧房里，搬把椅子在我床边，拉我的头发把我唤醒。 </p> 
<p>“我睡不着，艾伦，”她说，算是道歉。“我要有个活着的人分享我的幸福！埃德加在闹别扭，因为我为一件并不使他发生兴趣的事而高兴。他死不开口，除了说了些暴躁的傻话。而且他肯定说我又残忍又自私，因为在他这么不舒服而且困倦的时候，我还想跟他说话。他有一点别扭就总是想法生病，我说了几句称赞希刺克厉夫的话，他，不是因为头痛，就是因为在嫉妒心重，开始哭起来，所以我就起身离开他了。” </p> 
<p>“称赞希刺克厉夫有什么用呢？”我回答。“他们做孩子的时候就彼此有反感，要是希刺克厉夫听你称赞他，也会一样地痛恨的——那是人性呀。不要让林惇先生再听到关于他的话吧，除非你愿意他们公开吵闹起来。” </p> 
<p>“那他不是表现了很大的弱点吗？”她追问着。“我是不嫉妒的——我对于伊莎贝拉的漂亮的黄头发，她的白皙的皮肤，她那端庄的风度，还有全家对她所表示的喜爱，可从来不觉得苦恼呀。甚至你，耐莉，假使我们有时候争执，你立刻向着伊莎贝拉，我就像个没主见的妈妈似的让步了——我叫她宝贝，把她哄得心平气和。她哥哥看见我们和睦就高兴，这也使我高兴。可是他们非常相像：他们是惯坏了的孩子，幻想这世界就是为了他们的方便才存在的。虽然我依着他们俩，可我又想狠狠的惩罚他们一下也许会把他们变好哩。” </p> 
<p>“你错了，林惇夫人，”我说。“他们迁就你哩——我知道他们要是不迁就你就会怎么样！只要他们努力不违背你的心意，你就得稍微忍让一下他们一时的小脾气。——但是，到末了，你们总会为了对于双方都有同等重要的什么事情闹开的，那时候你所认为软弱的人也能和你一样地固执哩。” </p> 
<p>“然后我们就要争到死，是吗，耐莉？”她笑着回嘴。“不！我告诉你，我对于林惇的爱情有着这样的信心：我相信我就是杀了他，他也不会想到报复的。” </p> 
<p>我劝她为了他的爱情那就更要尊重他些。 </p> 
<p>“我是尊重啊，”她回答。“可是他用不着为了一点琐碎小事就借题哭起来。那是孩子气。而且，不应该哭得那样伤心，就因为我说希刺克厉夫如今可值得尊重了，乡里第一名绅士也会以跟他结交为荣，他原应该替我说这话，而且由于同意还感到愉快哩，他必须习惯他，甚至喜欢他：想想希刺克厉夫多有理由反对他吧，我敢说希刺克厉夫的态度好极啦！” </p> 
<p>“你对于他去呼啸山庄有什么想法？”我问她。“显然他在各方面都改好了——简直成了基督徒：向他四周的敌人都伸出了友好的右手！” </p> 
<p>“他解释了，”她回答。“我也跟你一样奇怪。他说他去拜访是想从你那里得到关于我的消息，他以为你还住在那里。约瑟夫就告诉了辛德雷，他出来了，问他一直作些什么，怎么生活的，最后要他走进去了。本来有几个人坐在那儿玩牌，希刺克厉夫也加入了。我哥哥输了一些钱给他，发现他有不少钱，就请他今晚再去，他也答应了。辛德雷是荒唐得不会谨慎地选择他的朋友，他没有动脑筋想想对于一个他践踏过的人应该不予信任的道理。但是希刺克厉夫肯定说他所以跟从前迫害他的人重新联系，主要因为要找一个离田庄不远的住处，可以常来常往，而且对我们曾在一起住过的房子也有一种眷恋；还有一个希望，希望我会有更多的机会到那儿去看他，如果他住在吉默吞，机会就少啦。他打算慷慨解囊以便住在山庄，毫无疑问我哥哥因为贪财而接受他，辛德雷总是贪婪的，虽然他一手抓过来，另一手又丢出去。” </p> 
<p>“那倒是年轻人的好住处！”我说。“你不怕有什么后果吗，林惇夫人？”“对于我的朋友，我不担心，”她回答，“他那坚强的头脑会使他躲开危险的。对于辛德雷倒有些担心。可是他在道德方面，总不能比现在更坏吧。至于伤害身体，我是要从中阻挡的。今晚的事情使我跟上帝和人类又和解了！我曾经愤怒地反抗神。啊，我曾经忍受过非常非常的悲哀啊，耐莉！如果那个人知道我曾是那么苦，他就该对他那因无聊的愤怒而不知去向的往事引以为羞哩。我一个人受苦，对他还好些，如果我表达出我时常感到的悲痛，他也会像我一样地热望着解脱这悲痛的。不管怎么样，事情过去啦，我对他的愚蠢也不要报复，今后我什么都能忍受啦！即便世上最下贱的东西打我的嘴巴，我不但要转过另一边给他打，还要请他原谅我惹他动手。而且，作为一个保证，我马上就要跟埃德加讲和啦。晚安！我是一个天使！” </p> 
<p>她就怀着这样自我陶醉的信心走了，第二天她显然已成功地实现了自己的决心。林惇先生不仅不再抱怨（虽然他的情绪看来仍然被凯瑟琳的旺盛的欢乐所压倒），而且居然不反对她带着伊莎贝拉下午一起去呼啸山庄。她用这么大量的甜言蜜语来报答他，使全家有好几天像天堂一样，不论主仆都从这无穷的阳光中获益不浅。 </p> 
<p>希刺克厉夫——以后我要说希刺克厉夫先生了——起初还倒是谨慎地使用着拜访画眉田庄的自由权利，他仿佛在掂量田庄主人将怎样看待他的光临。凯瑟琳也认为在接待他时把她高兴的表情稍稍节制一下得当些，他渐渐地得到了他被接待的权利。他还保留不少在他童年时就很显著的缄默，这种缄默刚好能压抑情感的一切令人吃惊的表现。我主人的不安暂时平息了，以后的情况又使他的不安暂时转到另一个方面去了。 </p> 
<p>他的烦恼的新根源，是从一件没有预料到的不幸的事而来的，伊莎贝拉对这位勉强受到招待的客人，表示了一种突然而不可抗拒的爱慕之情。那时她是一个十八岁的娇媚的小姐，举止还是孩子气的，虽然具有敏锐的才智，敏锐的感觉，如果给惹气了，还有一种敏锐的脾气。她的哥哥深深地爱着她，对于这荒诞的爱情惊骇万分。且不提和一个没名没姓的人联姻有失身份，也不提他若无男嗣，他的财产很可能落在这么一个人的掌握之中——把这些都搁在一边不提，他也还能理解希刺克厉夫的性格。他知道，虽然他的外貌变了，他的心地是不能变的，也没有变。他害怕，他使他反感，他不敢想到把伊莎贝拉交托给他，像有什么预感似的。如果他知道她的恋情是未经被追求就自己涌现出来了，而且对方以毫不动情作为报答，他更要畏缩了。因为他一发现这恋情的存在，就怪希刺克厉夫，认为是他精心策划出来的。 </p> 
<p>有一段时间，我们都看出林惇小姐不知为什么事心烦意乱，而且很忧伤。她变得别扭而且消沉，常常叱骂揶揄凯瑟琳，眼看就有耗尽她那有限的耐性的危险。我们多多少少原谅她，借口说她不健康，她就在我们眼前萎靡憔悴下去。但是有一天，她特别执拗，不肯吃早餐，抱怨仆人不照她所吩咐的去作。女主人不许她在家里作任何事，而且埃德加也不睬她，又抱怨屋门敞开使她受了凉，而我们让客厅的炉火灭了存心惹她生气。此外还有一百条琐碎的诉苦。林惇夫人断然要她上床睡觉，而且把她痛骂一顿，吓唬她说要请大夫来。一提到肯尼兹，她立刻大叫，说她的健康情况十分好，只是凯瑟琳的苛刻使她不快乐而已。 </p> 
<p>“你怎么能说我苛刻呢，你这怪脾气的宝贝？”女主人叫起来，对这毫无道理的论断感到莫名其妙。“你一定没有理性啦。我哪时候苛刻啦？告诉我！” </p> 
<p>“昨天，”伊莎贝拉抽泣着，“还有现在！” </p> 
<p>“昨天，”她嫂嫂说。“什么时候呀？” </p> 
<p>“在我们顺着荒野散步的时候，你吩咐我随便去溜达一下，而你却跟希刺克厉夫先生闲逛啦！” </p> 
<p>“这就是你所谓的苛刻吗？”凯瑟琳说，笑起来，“这并不是暗示你的陪伴是多余的，我们才不在乎你跟不跟我们在一起。我只不过以为希刺克厉夫的话你听着也未必有趣。” </p> 
<p>“啊，不，”小姐哭着，“你愿意我走开，因为你知道我喜欢在那儿！” </p> 
<p>“她神智清楚吗？”林惇夫人对我说。“我要把我们的谈话一个字一个字地背出来，伊莎贝拉，你把其中对你有任何吸引力的话指出来吧。” </p> 
<p>“我不在乎谈话，”她回答，“我要跟——” </p> 
<p>“怎么！”凯瑟琳说，看出她犹豫着，不知要不要说全这句话。 </p> 
<p>“跟他在一起，我不要总是给人打发走！”她接着说，激动起来。“你是马槽里的一只狗①，凯蒂，而且希望谁也不要被人爱上，除了你自己！” </p> 
<p>①引自《伊索寓言》，指已不能享用，而又不肯与人的鄙夫，即心术不正者。 </p> 
<p>“你是一个胡闹的小猴子！”林惇夫人惊奇地叫起来。“可我不能相信这件蠢事！你没法博得希刺克厉夫的爱慕——你不能把他当作情投意合的人！但愿是我误解你的话啦，伊莎贝拉？” </p> 
<p>“不，你没有，”这入了迷的姑娘说，“我爱他胜过你爱埃德加，而且他可以爱我的，只要你让他爱！” </p> 
<p>“那么，就是给我王位，我也不愿意是你！”凯瑟琳断然声明，她好像很诚恳地说着。“耐莉，帮帮我让她明白她在发疯。告诉她希刺克厉夫是什么样的人：一个没驯服的人，不懂文雅，没有教养，一片长着金雀花和岩石的荒野。要叫我把你的心交给他，我宁可在冬天把那只小金丝雀放到园子里！可惜你不懂他的性格，孩子，没有别的原因，就是这种可悲的糊涂，才会让那个梦钻进你的头脑里。求求你别妄想他在一副严峻的外表下深深埋藏着善心和恋情！他不是一块粗糙的钻石——乡下人当中的一个含珠之蚌，而是一个凶恶的，无情的，像狼一样残忍的人。我从来不对他说，‘放开这个或那个敌人吧，因为伤害他们是不正大光明的，残酷的。’我说，‘放开他们吧，因为我可不愿意他们被冤枉。’伊莎贝拉，如果他发现你是一个麻烦的负担，他会把你当作麻雀蛋似的捏碎。我知道他不会爱上一个林惇家的人。但是他也很可能跟你的财产和继承财产的希望结婚的。贪婪跟着他成长起来，成了易犯的罪恶。这就是我对他的写照。而且我是他的朋友——就因为如此，如果他真打算提到你，也许我应该不开口，让你掉在他的陷阱里去哩。” </p> 
<p>林惇小姐对她嫂嫂大怒。 </p> 
<p>“羞，羞！”她生气地重复着，“你比二十个敌人还坏，你这恶毒的朋友！” </p> 
<p>“啊，那么你不肯相信我？”凯瑟琳说，“你以为我说这些是出于阴险的自私心么？” </p> 
<p>“我确实知道你是的，”伊莎贝拉反唇相讥，“而且我一想到你就发抖！” </p> 
<p>“好！”另一个喊着。“如果你有那勇气，你就自己试试吧，我已经吃了亏。对于你的傲慢无礼，我也不跟你辩了。” </p> 
<p>“可我还得为了她的自私自利活受罪！”当林惇夫人离开这屋子时，她抽泣着。“一切，一切都反对我。她把我的唯一的安慰也毁掉啦。可是她说的是假话，不是吗？希刺克厉夫先生不是一个恶魔，他有一个可尊敬的心灵，一个真实的灵魂，不然他怎么还会记得她呢？” </p> 
<p>“把他从你的思想里撵出去吧，小姐，”我说。“他是一只不祥的鸟，不是你的配偶。林惇夫人说得过火些，可我驳不倒她。她比我，或比其他任何人，更熟悉他的心。而且她绝不会把他说得比他本人更坏。诚实的人不隐瞒他们所作的事。他怎么生活过来的？他怎么阔起来的？他为什么要住在呼啸山庄，那是他所痛恨的人的房子呀？他们说恩萧先生自从他到来之后越来越糟了。他们接二连三地整夜不睡，辛德雷把他的地也抵押出去了，什么事也不作，除了打牌喝酒。我只是在一星期以前才听说的——是约瑟夫告诉我的——我在吉默吞遇见他。‘耐莉！’他说，‘我们房子里的人得请个验尸官来验尸啦。都要死掉的一个为了拦住另一个像呆子似地扎自己，他本人也差点把手指头砍断。那就是主人，你知道，他想去受最高审判。他不怕那些裁判官，不怕保罗、彼得、约翰、马太①，他一个也不怕！他挺像——他还想厚着脸皮去见他们哩！还有你那个好孩子希刺克厉夫，你记得吧，他可是个宝贝！哪怕真正的魔鬼来玩把戏，他也会笑，把别人送掉。他去田庄时，就从来没说过他在我们这儿过的美妙的生活么？是这样的方式——太阳落时起床，掷骰子，白兰地，关上百叶窗，还有蜡烛，直到第二天中午——然后，那傻瓜就在他卧房里乒乒乓乓乱闹一场，使体面人都羞得用手指头堵起耳朵来。那个坏蛋呢，他倒能恬不知耻地又吃又喝，到邻居家跟人家老婆瞎扯去。当然啦，他会告诉凯瑟琳小姐</p>
