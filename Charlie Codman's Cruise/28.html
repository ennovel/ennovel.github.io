THE LASH.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      "Pipe all hands to see punishment inflicted," ordered Captain Brace.
<br> 
<br> Charlie and Bill Sturdy looked at each other, uncertain where the blow was to fall.
<br> 
<br> [223]
<br> 
<br> "It must be Antonio," thought our hero.
<br> 
<br> Evidently Antonio was of the same opinion, for over his swarthy face there stole a pallor which showed his apprehension.
<br> 
<br> Such was the understanding of the crew also, as they could think of no other wrongdoer. Little pity was excited in behalf of the supposed sufferer. He had so abused his position when champion of the crew, that he had forfeited the good-will of all; and even if this had not been the case, his treacherous and mean attempt to bring Charlie into trouble would have been sufficient to bring him into disfavor.
<br> 
<br> The uncertainty as to the victim was dissipated by the captain's next words.
<br> 
<br> "Jack Randall, come here!"
<br> 
<br> Charlie came forward.
<br> 
<br> "Boy," said Captain Brace, sternly, "you were guilty of insolence to me this morning. This shall never go unpunished while I am in command of a vessel. As to the ring, you may or may not have stolen it. It rests between you and Antonio. As it cannot be proved of either, neither will be punished on this account."
<br> 
<br> Antonio's sallow face lighted up with joy at this unexpected escape, a joy which was not reflected on the faces of the crew.
<br> 
<br> [224]
<br> 
<br> "It is for insolence, therefore, and not on account of theft," pursued the captain, "that I sentence you, Jack Randall, to a dozen lashes on the bare back. Off with your jacket!"
<br> 
<br> Charlie was a brave boy, but the prospect of this ignominious punishment caused his check to pale and his voice to tremble, as he exclaimed, "Captain Brace, if I have been guilty of insolence or want of proper respect to you, it was not intentional. Do not compel me to submit to this disgraceful punishment."
<br> 
<br> There was a movement of sympathy among the crew, and more than one heart softened at the sight of Charlie's manly front, though his lips quivered, and pride alone kept back the tears from his eyes. Bill Sturdy started, but checked himself, to hear what the captain would say in response.
<br> 
<br> "It is too late," he said, coldly. "You should have thought of all that before you indulged in insolence."
<br> 
<br> "But——"
<br> 
<br> "It is too late, I say," roared the captain, irritated. "Strip, you young rascal, or you shall have some help about it, and that of a rough kind."
<br> 
<br> It seemed as if all chance of escape was[225] over for poor Charlie. But at that moment Bill Sturdy pressed forward, and, hitching up his trousers, as he was wont to do preparatory to speaking, said, in a distinct tone of voice, "Captain Brace."
<br> 
<br> "Well?" said the captain. "What have you to say?"
<br> 
<br> "I should like to make a proposal to you, sir."
<br> 
<br> "A proposal," repeated the captain, mystified. "What am I to understand by that?"
<br> 
<br> "It's just this, Captain Brace. You're the captain of this vessel, and you've got a right to flog that boy, I suppose, according to the law.
<br> 
<br> "Of course I have," said the captain, fiercely. "Do you presume to question that right?"
<br> 
<br> "I don't think proper to question it just now," said Bill; "but, Captain Brace, just look at that boy. Look at his bright, honest face, and you can't have the heart to abuse him."
<br> 
<br> "Abuse him!" exclaimed the captain, stamping on the deck in his fury; "say that again, and I'll have you flogged with him."
<br> 
<br> "It was something of that kind that I was going to propose," said Bill Sturdy.
<br> 
<br> [226]
<br> 
<br> Captain Brace stared at him in astonishment, a feeling which was shared by the crew.
<br> 
<br> "If you want to be flogged," said the captain, grimly, "we will try to accommodate you."
<br> 
<br> "It is in this way that I mean," exclaimed Bill. "I've taken a liking to that lad, and I've promised him I'll stand his friend. Now, Captain Brace, if somebody must be flogged, spare him, and flog me in his place."
<br> 
<br> Surprise was depicted on every face, and the sunburnt and rough-visaged men about him felt an involuntary thrill of respect and admiration, as Sturdy manfully came forward and offered his own back to the punishment, which is properly regarded as an insult to manhood, though the disgrace attaches not to the one who endures, but to the one who inflicts it.
<br> 
<br> Charlie was the first to speak. His generous heart revolted at the idea of escaping punishment at the expense of his friend.
<br> 
<br> "No, Bill Sturdy," said he, manfully, "I don't want you to suffer in my place. It'll be hard to bear it," and his lip quivered; "but it would be weak and cowardly for me to let anybody else suffer in my place."
<br> 
<br> Charlie began to take off his jacket.
<br> 
<br> [227]
<br> 
<br> There was a murmuring among the crew, testifying to the excitement which they felt.
<br> 
<br> "Put on your jacket, my lad," said Bill. "I'm older and tougher than you, and I can bear it better."
<br> 
<br> And the stout seaman pulled off his shirt, and displayed his brawny shoulders, and a chest whose breadth and depth betokened a strength which could not be styled less than Herculean.
<br> 
<br> Antonio looked on, his eye blazing with vindictive joy. Whichever was flogged, his satisfaction would be equal.
<br> 
<br> "Hark you!" exclaimed Captain Brace, interfering at this juncture. "I think that I shall choose to have a voice in this matter. So you wish," turning to Sturdy, "to relieve this boy of his punishment, do you?"
<br> 
<br> "I do," said the old seaman.
<br> 
<br> "I don't want him to," interrupted Charlie. "It is mine, and I will bear it."
<br> 
<br> "It seems the parties are not agreed," said the captain, sardonically.
<br> 
<br> "Spare him," said Bill Sturdy, his eyes resting affectionately on Charlie. "He is so young."
<br> 
<br> "Perhaps the best way in which I can please you both is to divide the punishment between you. I had sentenced this lad to[228] receive twelve lashes. Since you wish to do him a service, you shall receive six, and he the other six."
<br> 
<br> "I do not consent," said Sturdy, comprehending the captain's purpose to humiliate both. "If his back is to receive a single lash, my offer will not save him from the disgrace, and that is worse than the pain."
<br> 
<br> At this juncture the mate whispered something in the captain's ear.
<br> 
<br> The face of the latter lighted up with satisfaction, and his next words revealed the nature of the mate's suggestion.
<br> 
<br> "I consent to the substitution," he said, and then paused.
<br> 
<br> Bill Sturdy's face glowed with generous satisfaction, and with heroic forgetfulness of self, he began to strip for punishment.
<br> 
<br> A moment, and his back, broad and ample, was bared and the thick, corded muscles could be seen.
<br> 
<br> "Antonio, come forward," said Captain Brace.
<br> 
<br> Antonio advanced amid the general surprise of the crew, and somewhat to his own, and stood still, awaiting orders.
<br> 
<br> "Now," said Captain Brace, his tone showing his malignant satisfaction. "I appoint you as my deputy to administer twelve[229] lashes to this man; mind that you don't spare him."
<br> 
<br> Antonio did not need this injunction. His eyes were full of fiendish triumph, as he seized the instrument of torture, and flourished it above his head.
<br> 
<br> As for Bill Sturdy, when he knew that Antonio was to be employed to inflict punishment upon him, this refinement of torture shook his resolution for a moment. It was, indeed, the bitterest drop in the cup. But not for an instant did his resolution falter. He would save Charlie at all hazards. He quickly recovered himself, and said, in a firm voice, "I am ready."
<br> 
<br> Instantly the lash was whirled aloft, and buried itself in his flesh.
<br> 
<br> There was a quiver, and that was all.
<br> 
<br> One—two—three—four—
<br> 
<br> In fast succession the blows fall upon his flesh, he meanwhile standing firmly braced, though his cheek was paler than its wont.
<br> 
<br> Charlie's heart sickened, and he closed his eyes to shut out the fearful spectacle.
<br> 
<br> As for Antonio, he seemed to revel in the task which had been assigned him. His eyes fairly danced with baleful light, and he seemed almost beside himself. It was this, perhaps,[230] that led him to exceed by one the strokes which he had been ordered to administer.
<br> 
<br> A moment after, and the lash was wrested from him by Bill Sturdy, who threw him to the deck, with one powerful grasp tore the covering from his back, and buried the lash which had scarred his own back in the flesh of his late executioner who with face distorted with fright and pain roared for mercy.
<br> 
<br> "That is to pay for the blow you struck on your own account, you scoundrel," exclaimed Sturdy. "And now," as the lash descended once more with prodigious force, and the victim fairly writhed under it, "you are one in my debt."
