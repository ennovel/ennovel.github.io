CHARLIE GETS INTO TROUBLE.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      Charlie, at first taken by surprise when the charge of theft was brought against him, now looked scornfully indignant. Ignorant of the ways of the world, and the wickedness of which some men are capable, he never, for a moment, feared the result of the investigation. As for the crew, they had already become interested in his favor, and now pitied him for the unfortunate position in which he found himself placed. None of them believed him guilty.
<br> 
<br> As the captain had directed, his chest was brought on deck.
<br> 
<br> Before this was searched, however, he was subjected to a personal examination, at which nothing was discovered. There was a murmur of satisfaction.
<br> 
<br> "The lad never stole the ring," said a stout seaman, standing next to the real perpetrator of the crime, Antonio.
<br> 
<br> "Don't be too sure of that," said the Spaniard,[203] in a malignant tone. "His chest hasn't been searched yet."
<br> 
<br> "I don't care for that; I can tell by his face. A lad, with such a figure-head as that, wouldn't do anything mean or dishonorable."
<br> 
<br> "You seem to have taken a great fancy to him," sneered Antonio. "You mustn't trust too much to appearances. He looks to me as if he were guilty."
<br> 
<br> Charlie's cheeks were flushed, but not with shame or confusion. It was indignation, that he should be suspected of such a disgraceful crime.
<br> 
<br> By his side stood Bill Sturdy, who took an opportunity of whispering into his ear, "Never you mind, my lad, even if the ring is found in your chest."
<br> 
<br> "But it isn't there," said Charlie.
<br> 
<br> "It may be," said Bill, who, by this time, suspected the nature of Antonio's two errands below.
<br> 
<br> "How should it be there?" asked Charlie quite in the dark.
<br> 
<br> "It might have been put there, my lad."
<br> 
<br> [204]
<br> 
<br> "But who could put it there?" persisted our hero, but little enlightened.
<br> 
<br> "Hark you, my lad," said Bill, still farther lowering his tones; "you've got more than one enemy on board this ship."
<br> 
<br> "The mate?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, and the captain too, for that matter."
<br> 
<br> "But neither of them would put the ring in my chest."
<br> 
<br> "No, probably not."
<br> 
<br> "Then who would?"
<br> 
<br> "There is another enemy besides these two."
<br> 
<br> "Do you mean Antonio?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes."
<br> 
<br> "But he seemed friendly lately."
<br> 
<br> "He isn't to be trusted, my lad. He's borne a grudge against both of us ever since I got the better of him the other day, and he's made up his mind to be revenged. I've been watching him when he didn't suspect it, and know more than he thinks I do."
<br> 
<br> "Do you know anything of this affair, Bill?" asked Charlie, looking up hopefully into the face of his friend.
<br> 
<br> [205]
<br> 
<br> "I expect I do."
<br> 
<br> "What is it?" questioned our hero, eagerly.
<br> 
<br> "I shall save it till it will do some good. But see, they have nearly finished searching your chest. Perhaps the ring is not there after all."
<br> 
<br> As Bill said, the search was nearly completed. Charlie's clothes had been unceremoniously tumbled out upon deck, which was not calculated to improve their appearance, and the captain and mate, who had shown themselves particularly active on the occasion, were peering about in search of the lost ring.
<br> 
<br> It chanced, however, that the ring had got in a fold of one of the shirts which lay upon deck. Of course, therefore, the search in the chest proved unavailing.
<br> 
<br> "I doubt whether it is here," said the captain, in a tone of disappointment.
<br> 
<br> "Let us look a little longer," said the mate, who could not so easily resign the chance of getting into trouble the boy whom he hated with a malevolence such as his nature was capable of.
<br> 
<br> [206]
<br> 
<br> Antonio became alarmed at the prospect of all his plans being frustrated by a failure to find the ring.
<br> 
<br> When the mate also gave up the search, he came forward, and, addressing the captain, said,—
<br> 
<br> "Captain Brace, if you will let me assist in the search, perhaps I can succeed in finding it."
<br> 
<br> "You are the one that saw the boy have it, are you?" queried the captain.
<br> 
<br> "Yes, sir."
<br> 
<br> "How long since?"
<br> 
<br> "About half an hour."
<br> 
<br> "Why did you not mention it at the time?"
<br> 
<br> "I thought perhaps he had only picked it up, and would give it back to you," said the Spaniard, in some confusion. "I didn't want to charge him with the theft till I felt sure he meant to steal it."
<br> 
<br> "And what makes you feel sure he did so intend?"
<br> 
<br> "Because when you said the ring was lost, he did not come forward and restore it."
<br> 
<br> "Ay," said Captain Brace, "that is strongly[207] against him. If it is found that he has concealed it anywhere, he shall repent it, by——"
<br> 
<br> It is unnecessary to stain our pages by printing the oath with which he emphasized this assertion.
<br> 
<br> "What reason have you for supposing that he concealed it in his chest?" asked the mate.
<br> 
<br> "Because I saw him go down below," answered Antonio, with unblushing falsehood.
<br> 
<br> "It's a lie," said Charlie, boldly. "I haven't been below this morning."
<br> 
<br> "Silence!" thundered the captain, scowling menacingly; "don't add falsehood to theft."
<br> 
<br> "I haven't been guilty of theft," said Charlie boldly.
<br> 
<br> "Silence!" again thundered the captain, "or it will be the worse for you."
<br> 
<br> "You had better not say anything more, my lad," whispered Bill Sturdy; "we shall yet bring you off with flying colors. Don't you fear. Bill Sturdy is your friend, and he will stand by you."
<br> 
<br> Charlie looked grateful.
<br> 
<br> When his statement had been so unequivocably[208] denied by our hero, Antonio suffered himself to look at him for one instant, but in that brief glance was concentrated so much of spite and venom and malice, that the boy could not help shuddering, as if the countenance of a fiend had been unexpectedly revealed to him.
<br> 
<br> "I think, Captain Brace," said Randall, "that we may venture to let Antonio assist us, since he may succeed where we have failed."
<br> 
<br> "Very well," said the captain, "I have no objection to offer. On the contrary, if he succeeds in finding it, I will take care that he shall be rewarded."
<br> 
<br> Antonio was already on his knees before the chest. There was a murmur of disapprobation among the crew. They were in favor of fair play, and this undue eagerness to convict our hero of guilt did not commend itself to their sense of justice and generosity. But Antonio cared little for the sensation which his conduct might excite among his fellow-seamen. He cared more for the gratification of his revenge than for personal popularity.
<br> 
<br> [209]
<br> 
<br> A glance satisfied him that the ring was not in the chest. He next began to examine carefully the clothes which had been taken out and were lying on deck.
<br> 
<br> In lifting and shaking a shirt the ring rolled out.
<br> 
<br> "There is your ring, Captain Brace," said he, in a tone of exultation, as he picked it up and extended it to the captain.
