A STORM BREWING.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      Antonio's assault was so unexpected that Bill Sturdy, being, of course, quite unprepared for it, staggered and seemed about to fall. But, as one who slips upon the ice instinctively makes an effort to preserve his equilibrium, so Sturdy immediately recovered from the momentary disadvantage, and seizing Antonio with both hands threw him to the deck without any great apparent effort.
<br> 
<br> [217]
<br> 
<br> Probably if Antonio had gained the advantage, Captain Brace would have been in no haste to put a stop to the conflict. As it was, his brows knit with anger as he exclaimed, in a stentorian voice,—
<br> 
<br> "Stop this fighting, you lubbers! Don't you know better the respect which is due to my presence, you—rascals! I'll let you know that I am not to be insulted on my own deck."
<br> 
<br> "It wasn't a fight of my seeking, Captain Brace," said Bill, coolly. "I ain't disposed to be quarrelsome, and I guess he won't want to try it again immediately."
<br> 
<br> As he said this he glanced at Antonio, who, sorely bruised by the fall, was slowly rising from the deck, and slinking away with a crestfallen and malignant look. Had he not been moved by an uncontrollable impulse of rage and disappointment, he would scarcely have ventured upon this open attack, knowing, as had been incontestably proved, that he was no match for the Herculean strength of Bill Sturdy.
<br> 
<br> "Silence!" roared the captain, in answer to Bill's vindication of himself. "One would think from your manner that you were the captain of this ship instead of me."
<br> 
<br> "If I were the captain," said Bill, bluntly,[218] "I'd have that man," pointing to Antonio, "put ashore at the first port. I wouldn't harbor such a rascal aboard the ship."
<br> 
<br> "Silence!" again thundered the captain. "Don't you know your place? If you don't, by all the saints in the calendar, I'll make you know it before twenty-four hours have passed over your head. Let me tell you that I don't require any help in commanding this vessel. When I do, I will call on you. Till then, you may keep your advice to yourself."
<br> 
<br> Bill shrugged his shoulders, but thought it prudent, on the whole, to say nothing. Not that he feared for himself. He had a good deal of confidence in the strength with which nature had endowed him, but he feared that any unguarded words of his might incite the captain and mate to visit new hardships upon his young protégé, Charlie.
<br> 
<br> "As to the matter of the ring," said the captain, "my mind is not made up. Mr. Randall, will you attend me?"
<br> 
<br> The mate went below with Captain Brace.
<br> 
<br> After a moment's silence the captain said, "I don't like that fellow, Mr. Randall."
<br> 
<br> "Do you mean Antonio?"
<br> 
<br> "No; this Sturdy, who takes such airs upon himself."
<br> 
<br> "Neither do I," answered Randall, promptly.
<br> 
<br> [219]
<br> 
<br> "He's a mutinous rebel. I can see it in his eye," pursued the captain.
<br> 
<br> "I have no doubt he would be if he had a good opportunity."
<br> 
<br> "Perhaps I shall give him one," said the captain, significantly.
<br> 
<br> "He's as strong as a bull," said the mate.
<br> 
<br> "Yes; the fellow has fists like sledge-hammers, but he may use them once too often. We will speak of that hereafter. Now what do you think of this robbery?"
<br> 
<br> "I suppose Antonio was the thief," said Randall, reluctantly.
<br> 
<br> "You think Sturdy's story is correct?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes; Antonio is a deep rascal, though of the two I hate Sturdy most."
<br> 
<br> "Did you suppose your nephew to be the thief before the latter told his story?"
<br> 
<br> "I did not."
<br> 
<br> "Yet you countenanced the charge."
<br> 
<br> "Because I thought a flogging would do the boy no harm."
<br> 
<br> "You don't seem to have any great affection for your nephew."
<br> 
<br> "I do not."
<br> 
<br> "And the reason?"
<br> 
<br> "Is simply this. The boy's mother jilted me, or rather refused me outright when I offered my hand in marriage."
<br> 
<br> [220]
<br> 
<br> "Ha, that's where the shoe pinches."
<br> 
<br> "You are right."
<br> 
<br> "Well, I don't care to interfere with any little private revenge you may desire to take, as long as it chimes in with my own purposes. The boy shall be flogged if you wish it."
<br> 
<br> "I do."
<br> 
<br> "Find some pretext then, as long as the charge of robbery won't serve."
<br> 
<br> "Then," said Randall, "you might announce that, although the charge of theft had not been sustained, he had been guilty of an offence that called for punishment—insolence to his officers."
<br> 
<br> "That is a good idea. And in regard to Antonio——"
<br> 
<br> "I have no doubt the rascal stole the ring, and deserves punishment, but I don't want him flogged, as it would gratify Sturdy too much."
<br> 
<br> "My own feeling."
<br> 
<br> "You can say that you have been unable to determine who is guilty in the matter, and shall wait for further evidence."
<br> 
<br> "Very well conceived, Mr. Randall. I shall follow your advice, and thank you for it."
<br> 
<br> "I am glad to have been of service to you, Captain Brace."
<br> 
<br> [221]
<br> 
<br> "And now, Mr. Randall, if you will go on deck, I will be up presently."
<br> 
<br> The mate reappeared on deck with a satisfied air, occasionally looking with a glance of triumphant spite at Charlie, who was standing beside his tried and trusty friend, Bill Sturdy.
<br> 
<br> "You don't know what's in store for you, my lad," he muttered. "Pity his mother could not be here to see his fair flesh quivering under the keen lash. Her heart would feel every stroke. She might repent then, the scorn with which she repelled the suit of John Randall. How I hate that boy! He brings up his father before me. So much the better. When he shrinks beneath the lash, I shall think it is my old rival upon whom it is falling."
<br> 
<br> Bill Sturdy, meanwhile, said in a low voice to Charlie, "I don't like the looks of the mate this morning. He's hatching mischief of some kind, if I'm not greatly mistaken."
<br> 
<br> "Against us?"
<br> 
<br> "That's what I mistrust, my lad; against one or both of us. He hates us both, and I ain't quite sure which he hates the most."
<br> 
<br> "And yet I never did him any injury."
<br> 
<br> "Then he's done you some harm, depend upon it. People hate worst those they have[222] injured most, and he's done you a great wrong in stealing you from home."
<br> 
<br> "What do you suppose made him do that, Bill?"
<br> 
<br> "He had some private reason; there ain't a question about that. It wasn't because we were in want of a boy. We might have picked up plenty that would have been glad to come."
<br> 
<br> "I'm afraid you'll get into trouble with him for taking my part," said Charlie, with some anxiety.
<br> 
<br> "Don't trouble yourself about me," said Sturdy, shrugging his shoulders. "I ain't in any way frightened by his black looks, and if he tries to do you any mischief, he'll find you've got one friend."
<br> 
<br> Before Charlie had an opportunity to reply, Captain Brace came on deck, and looked around him with a glance that showed a storm was brewing.
