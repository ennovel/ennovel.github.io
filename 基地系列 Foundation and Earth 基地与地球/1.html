<br> was a graduate student in chemistry at Columbia University and had been
<br> writing science fiction professionally for three years. I was hastening
<br> to see John Campbell, editor of Astounding , to whom I had sold
<br> five stories by then. I was anxious to tell him a new idea I had for a
<br> science fiction story.
<br> 
<br> It was to write a historical novel of the future; to tell the story of
<br> the fall of the Galactic Empire. My enthusiasm must have been catching,
<br> for Campbell grew as excited as I was. He didn't want me to write a
<br> single story. He wanted a series of stories, in which the full history
<br> of the thousand years of turmoil between the fall of the First Galactic
<br> Empire and the rise of the Second Galactic Empire was to be outlined. It
<br> would all be illuminated by the science of "psychohistory" that Campbell
<br> and I thrashed out between us.
<br> 
<br> The first story appeared in the May 1942 Astounding and the second
<br> story appeared in the June 1942 issue. They were at once popular and
<br> Campbell saw to it that I wrote six more stories before the end of the
<br> decade. The stories grew longer, too. The first one was only twelve
<br> thousand words long. Two of the last three stories were fifty thousand
<br> words apiece.
<br> 
<br> By the time the decade was over, I had grown tired of the series,
<br> dropped it, and went on to other things. By then, however, various
<br> publishing houses were beginning to put out hardcover science fiction
<br> books. One such house was a small semiprofessional firm, Gnome Press. They
<br> published my Foundation series in three volumes: Foundation (1951); Foundation and Empire (1952); and Second Foundation (1953). The three books together came to be known as The Foundation
<br> Trilogy .
<br> 
<br> The books did not do very well, for Gnome Press did not have the
<br> capital with which to advertise and promote them. I got neither statements
<br> nor royalties from them.
<br> 
<br> In early 1961, my then-editor at Doubleday, Timothy Seldes, told
<br> me he had received a request from a foreign publisher to reprint the
<br> Foundation books. Since they were not Doubleday books, he passed the
<br> request on to me.
<br> 
<br> I shrugged my shoulders. "Not interested, Tim. I don't get royalties
<br> on those books."
<br> 
<br> Seldes was horrified, and instantly set about getting the rights
<br> to the books from Gnome Press (which was, by that time, moribund) and
<br> in August of that year, the books (along with I, Robot ) became
<br> Doubleday property.
<br> 
<br> From that moment on, the Foundation series took off and began to earn
<br> increasing royalties. Doubleday published the Trilogy in a single
<br> volume and distributed them through the Science Fiction Book Club. Because
<br> of that the Foundation series became enormously well-known.
<br> 
<br> In the 1966 World Science Fiction Convention, held in Cleveland, the
<br> fans were asked to vote on a category of "The Best All-Time Series." It
<br> was the first time (and, so far, the last) the category had been included
<br> in the nominations for the Hugo Award. The Foundation Trilogy won the award, which further added to the popularity of the series.
<br> 
<br> Increasingly, fans kept asking me to continue the series. I was polite
<br> but I kept refusing. Still, it fascinated me that people who had not
<br> yet been born when the series was begun had managed to become caught up
<br> in it.
<br> 
<br> Doubleday, however, took the demands far more seriously than I
<br> did. They had humored me for twenty years but as the demands kept
<br> growing in intensity and number, they finally lost patience. In 1981,
<br> they told me that I simply had to write another Foundation novel and,
<br> in order to sugar-coat the demand, offered me a contract at ten times
<br> my usual advance.
<br> 
<br> Nervously, I agreed. It had been thirty-two years since I had written
<br> a Foundation story and now I was instructed to write one 140,000 words
<br> long, twice that of any of the earlier volumes and nearly three times
<br> as long as any previous individual story. I re-read The Foundation
<br> Trilogy and, taking a deep breath, dived into the task.
<br> 
<br> The fourth book of the series, Foundation's Edge , was published
<br> in October 1982, and then a very strange thing happened.
