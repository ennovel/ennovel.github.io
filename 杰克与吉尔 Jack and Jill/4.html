She never used tomind trifles, but now she frets about the oddest things, and I can'tchange them. This wall-paper is well enough, but she has taken afancy that the spots on it look like spiders, and it makes hernervous. I've no other warm place to put her, and no money for anew paper. Poor lass! There are hard times before her, I'm fearing.</p> 
<p>　　Mrs. Pecq said this in a low voice to Mrs. Minot, who came in asoften as she could, to see what her neighbor needed; for bothmothers were anxious, and sympathy drew them to one another.</p> 
<p>　　While one woman talked, the other looked about the little room,not wondering in the least that Jill found it hard to be contentedthere. It was very neat, but so plain that there was not even apicture on the walls, nor an ornament upon the mantel, except thenecessary clock, lamp, and match-box. The paper was ugly, beinga deep buff with a brown figure that did look very like spiderssprawling over it, and might well make one nervous to look at dayafter day.</p> 
<p>　　Jill was asleep in the folding chair Dr. Whiting had sent, with amattress to make it soft. The back could be raised or lowered atwill; but only a few inches had been gained as yet, and the thinhair pillow was all she could bear. She looked very pretty as shelay, with dark lashes against the feverish cheeks, lips apart, and acloud of curly black locks all about the face pillowed on one arm.</p> 
<p>　　She seemed like a brilliant little flower in that dull place for theFrench blood in her veins gave her a color, warmth, and gracewhich were very charming. Her natural love of beauty showeditself in many ways: a red ribbon had tied up her hair, a gay butfaded shawl was thrown over the bed, and the gifts sent her werearranged with care upon the table by her side among her own fewtoys and treasures. There was something pathetic in this childishattempt to beautify the poor place, and Mrs. Minot's eyes were fullas she looked at the tired woman, whose one joy and comfort laythere in such sad plight.</p> 
<p>　　"My dear soul, cheer up, and we will help one another through thehard times," she said, with a soft hand on the rough one, and a lookthat promised much.</p> 
<p>　　"Please God, we will, mem! With such good friends, I nevershould complain. I try not to do it, but it breaks my heart to see mylittle lass spoiled for life, most like"; and Mrs. Pecq pressed thekind hand with a despondent sigh.</p> 
<p>　　"We won't say, or even think, that, yet. Everything is possible toyouth and health like Janey s. We must keep her happy, and timewill do the rest, I'm sure. Let us begin at once, and have a surprisefor her when she wakes."As she spoke, Mrs. Minot moved quietly about the room, pinningthe pages of several illustrated papers against the wall at the footof the bed, and placing to the best advantage the other comfortsshe had brought.</p> 
<p>　　"Keep up your heart, neighbor. I have an idea in my head which Ithink will help us all, if I can carry it out," she said, cheerily, as shewent, leaving Mrs. Pecq to sew on Jack's new night-gowns, withswift fingers, and the grateful wish that she might work for thesegood friends forever.</p> 
<p>　　As if the whispering and rustling had disturbed her, Jill soon beganto stir, and slowly opened the eyes which had closed so wearily onthe dull December afternoon. The bare wall with its brown spidersno longer confronted her, but the colored print of a little girldancing to the tune her father was playing on a guitar, while astately lady, with satin dress, ruff, and powder, stood looking on,well pleased. The quaint figure, in its belaced frock, quiltedpetticoat, and red-heeled shoes, seemed to come tripping towardher in such a life-like way, that she almost saw the curls blowback, heard the rustle of the rich brocade, and caught the sparkleof the little maid's bright eyes.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, how pretty! Who sent them?" asked Jill, eagerly, as her eyeglanced along the wall, seeing other new and interesting thingsbeyond: an elephant-hunt, a ship in full sail, a horse-race, and aball-room.</p> 
<p>　　"The good fairy who never comes empty-handed. Look round a bitand you will see more pretties all for you, my dearie"; and hermother pointed to a bunch of purple grapes in a green leaf plate, aknot of bright flowers pinned on the white curtain, and a gay littledouble gown across the foot of the bed.</p> 
<p>　　Jill clapped her hands, and was enjoying her new pleasures, whenin came Merry and Molly Loo, with Boo, of course, trotting afterher like a fat and amiable puppy. Then the good times began; thegown was put on, the fruit tasted, and the pictures were studiedlike famous works of art.</p> 
<p>　　"It's a splendid plan to cover up that hateful wall. I'd stick picturesall round and have a gallery. That reminds me! Up in the garret atour house is a box full of old fashion-books my aunt left. I oftenlook at them on rainy days, and they are very funny. I'll go thisminute and get everyone. We can pin them up, or make paperdolls"; and away rushed Molly Loo, with the small brotherwaddling behind, for, when he lost sight of her, he was desolateindeed.</p> 
<p>　　The girls had fits of laughter over the queer costumes of yearsgone by, and put up a splendid procession of ladies in full skirts,towering hats, pointed slippers, powdered hair, simpering faces,and impossible waists.</p> 
<p>　　"I do think this bride is perfectly splendid, the long train and vailare so sweet," said Jill, revelling in fine clothes as she turned fromone plate to another.</p> 
<p>　　"I like the elephants best, and I'd give anything to go on a huntlike that!" cried Molly Loo, who rode cows, drove any horse shecould get, had nine cats, and was not afraid of the biggest dog thatever barked.</p> 
<p>　　"I fancy 'The Dancing Lesson ; it is so sort of splendid, with thegreat windows, gold chairs, and fine folks. Oh, I would like to livein a castle with a father and mother like that," said Merry, who wasromantic, and found the old farmhouse on the bill a sad trial to herhigh-flown ideas of elegance.</p> 
<p>　　"Now, that ship, setting out for some far-away place, is more to mymind. I weary for home now and then, and mean to see it againsome day"; and Mrs. Pecq looked longingly at the English ship,though it was evidently outward bound. Then, as if reproachingherself for discontent, she added: "It looks like those I used to seegoing off to India with a load of missionaries. I came near goingmyself once, with a lady bound for Siam; but I went to Canadawith her sister, and here I am.""I'd like to be a missionary and go where folks throw their babiesto the crocodiles. I'd watch and fish them out, and have a school,and bring them up, and convert all the people till they knewbetter," said warm-hearted Molly Loo, who befriended everyabused animal and forlorn child she met.</p> 
<p>　　"We needn't go to Africa to be missionaries; they have 'em nearerhome and need 'em, too. In all the big cities there are a many, andthey have their hands full with the poor, the wicked, and thehelpless. One can find that sort of work anywhere, if one has amind," said Mrs. Pecq.</p> 
<p>　　"I wish we had some to do here. I'd so like to go round withbaskets of tea and rice, and give out tracts and talk to people.</p> 
<p>　　Wouldn't you, girls?" asked Molly, much taken with the new idea.</p> 
<p>　　"It would be rather nice to have a society all to ourselves, and havemeetings and resolutions and things," answered Merry, who wasfond of little ceremonies, and always went to the sewing circlewith her mother.</p> 
<p>　　"We wouldn't let the boys come in. We d have it a secret society,as they'd o their temperance lodge, and we d have badges andpass-words and grips. It would be fun if we can only get someheathen to work at!" cried Jill, ready for fresh enterprises of everysort.</p> 
<p>　　"I can tell you someone to begin on right away," said her mother,nodding at her. "As wild a little savage as I'd wish to see. Takeher in hand, and make a pretty-mannered lady of her. Begin athome, my lass, and you'll find missionary work enough for awhile.""Now, Mammy, you mean me! Well, I will begin; and I'll be sogood, folks won't know me. Being sick makes naughty childrenbehave in story-books, I'll see if live ones can t"; and Jill put onsuch a sanctified face that the girls laughed and asked for theirmissions also, thinking they would be the same.</p> 
<p>　　"You, Merry, might do a deal at home helping mother, and settingthe big brothers a good example. One little girl in a house can dopretty much as she will, especially if she has a mind to make plainthings nice and comfortable, and not long for castles before sheknows how to do her own tasks well," was the first unexpectedreply.</p> 
<p>　　Merry colored, but took the reproof sweetly, resolving to do whatshe could, and surprised to find how many ways seemed open toher after a few minutes thought.</p> 
<p>　　"Where shall I begin? I'm not afraid of a dozen crocodiles afterMiss Bat"; and Molly Loo looked about her with a fierce air,having had practice in battles with the old lady who kept herfather's house.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, dear, you haven't far to look for as nice a little heathen asyou d wish"; and Mrs. Pecq glanced at Boo, who sat on the floorstaring hard at them, attracted by the dread word "crocodile." Hehad a cold and no handkerchief, his little hands were red withchilblains, his clothes shabby, he had untidy darns in the knees ofhis stockings, and a head of tight curls that evidently had not beencombed for some time.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes, I know he is, and I try to keep him decent, but I forget, andhe hates to be fixed, and Miss Bat doesn't care, and father laughswhen I talk about it."Poor Molly Loo looked much ashamed as she made excuses, tryingat the same time to mend matters by seizing Boo and dusting himall over with her handkerchief, giving a pull at his hair as if ringingbells, and then dumping him down again with the despairingexclamation: "Yes, we re a pair of heathens, and there's no one tosave us if I don't."That was true enough; for Molly's father was a busy man, carelessof everything but his mills, Miss Bat was old and lazy, and felt asif she might take life easy after serving the motherless children formany years as well as she knew how. Molly was beginning to seehow much amiss things were at home, and old enough to feelmortified, though, as yet, she had done nothing to mend the matterexcept be kind to the little boy.</p> 
<p>　　"You will, my dear," answered Mrs. Pecq, encouragingly, for sheknew all about it. "Now you ve each got a mission, let us see howwell you will get on. Keep it secret, if you like, and report once aweek. I'll be a member, and we'll do great things yet.""We won't begin till after Christmas; there is so much to do, wenever shall have time for any more. Don't tell, and we'll start fairat New Year s, if not before," said Jill, taking the lead as usual.</p> 
<p>　　Then they went on with the gay ladies, who certainly were heathenenough in dress to be in sad need of conversion to common-senseat least.</p> 
<p>　　"I feel as if I was at a party," said Jill, after a pause occupied insurveying her gallery with great satisfaction, for dress was herdelight, and here she had every conceivable style and color.</p> 
<p>　　"Talking of parties, isn't it too bad that we must give up ourChristmas fun? Can't get on without you and Jack, so we are notgoing to do a thing, but just have our presents," said Merry, sadly,as they began to fit different heads and bodies together, to try drolleffects.</p> 
<p>　　"I shall be all well in a fortnight, I know; but Jack won t, for it willtake more than a month to mend his poor leg. Maybe, they willhave a dance in the boys big room, and he can look on," suggestedJill, with a glance at the dancing damsel on the wall, for she dearlyloved it, and never guessed how long it would be before her lightfeet would keep time to music again.</p> 
<p>　　"You d better give Jack a hint about the party. Send over somesmart ladies, and say they have come to his Christmas ball,"proposed audacious Molly Loo, always ready for fun.</p> 
<p>　　So they put a preposterous green bonnet, top-heavy with plumes,on a little lady in yellow, who sat in a carriage; the lady beside her,in winter costume of velvet pelisse and ermine boa, was fitted to abride's head with its orange flowers and veil, and these works ofart were sent over to Jack, labelled "Miss Laura and Lotty Burtongoing to the Minots' Christmas balI" a piece of naughtiness onJill's part, for she knew Jack liked the pretty sisters, whose gentlemanners made her own wild ways seem all the more blamable.</p> 
<p>　　No answer came for a long time, and the girls had almost forgottentheir joke in a game of Letters, when "Tingle, tangle!" went thebell, and the basket came in heavily laden. A roll of colored paperswas tied outside, and within was a box that rattled, a green andsilver horn, a roll of narrow ribbons, a spool of strong thread, somelarge needles, and a note from Mrs. Minot:</p> 
<p>　　"Dear Jill-I think of having a Christmas tree so that our invalidscan enjoy it, and all your elegant friends are cordially invited.</p> 
<p>　　Knowing that you would like to help, I send some paper forsugar-plum horns and some beads for necklaces. They willbrighten the tree and please the girls for themselves or their dolls.</p> 
<p>　　Jack sends you a horn for a pattern, and will you make aladder-necklace to show him how? Let me know if you needanything.</p> 
<p>　　Yours in haste,Anna Minot""She knew what the child would like, bless her kind heart," saidMrs. Pecq to herself, and something brighter than the most silverybead shone on Jack's shirt-sleeve, as she saw the rapture of Jillover the new work and the promised pleasure.</p> 
<p>　　Joyful cries greeted the opening of the box, for bunches ofsplendid large bugles appeared in all colors, and a lively discussionwent on as to the best contrasts. Jill could not refuse to let herfriends share the pretty work, and soon three necklaces glittered onthree necks, as each admired her own choice.</p> 
<p>　　"I'd be willing to hurt my back dreadfully, if I could lie and dosuch lovely things all day," said Merry, as she reluctantly put downher needle at last, for home duties waited to be done, and lookedmore than ever distasteful after this new pleasure.</p> 
<p>　　"So would I! Oh, do you think Mrs. Minot will let you fill thehorns when they are done? I'd love to help you then. Be sure yousend for me!" cried Molly Loo, arching her neck like a proudpigeon to watch the glitter of her purple and gold necklace on herbrown gown.</p> 
<p>　　"I'm afraid you couldn't be trusted, you love sweeties so, and I msure Boo couldn't. But I'll see about it," replied Jill, with aresponsible air.</p> 
<p>　　The mention of the boy recalled him to their minds, and lookinground they found him peacefully absorbed in polishing up the floorwith Molly's pocket-handkerchief and oil from the littlemachine-can. Being torn from this congenial labor, he was carriedoff shining with grease and roaring lustily.</p> 
<p>　　But Jill did not mind her loneliness now, and sang like a happycanary while she threaded her sparkling beads, or hung the gayhorns to dry, ready f or their cargoes of sweets. So Mrs. Minot'srecipe for sunshine proved successful, and mother-wit made thewintry day a bright and happy one for both the little prisoners.</p>
