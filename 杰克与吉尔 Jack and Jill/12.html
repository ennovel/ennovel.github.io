The Bird Room was thetheatre, being very large, with four doors conveniently placed.</p> 
<p>　　Ralph was in his element, putting up a little stage, drilling boys,arranging groups, and uniting in himself carpenter, scene-painter,manager, and gas man. Mrs. Minot permitted the house to beturned topsy-turvy, and Mrs. Pecq flew about, lending a handeverywhere. Jill was costumer, with help from Miss Delano, whodid not care for balls, and kindly took charge of the girls. Jackprinted tickets, programmes, and placards of the most imposingsort, and the work went gayly on till all was ready.</p> 
<p>　　When the evening came, the Bird Room presented a fineappearance. One end was curtained off with red drapery; and realfootlights, with tin shades, gave a truly theatrical air to the littlestage. Rows of chairs, filled with mammas and little people,occupied the rest of the space. The hall and Frank's room were fullof amused papas, uncles, and old gentlemen whose patriotismbrought them out in spite of rheumatism. There was a greatrustling of skirts, fluttering of fans, and much lively chat, till a bellrang and the orchestra struck up.</p> 
<p>　　Yes, there really was an orchestra, for Ed declared that the nationalairs must be played, or the whole thing would be a failure. So hehad exerted himself to collect all the musical talent he could find,a horn, a fiddle, and a flute, with drum and fife for the martialscenes. Ed looked more beaming than ever, as he waved his batonand led off with Yankee Doodle as a safe beginning, for everyoneknew that. It was fun to see little Johnny Cooper bang away on abig drum, and old Mr. Munson, who had been a flEer all his days,blow till he was as red as a lobster, while everyone kept time to themusic which put them all in good spirits for the opening scene.</p> 
<p>　　Up went the curtain and several trees in tubs appeared, then astately gentleman in small clothes, cocked hat, gray wig, and animposing cane, came slowly walking in. It was Gus, who had beenunanimously chosen not only for Washington but for the f ather ofthe hero also, that the family traits of long legs and a somewhatmassive nose might be preserved.</p> 
<p>　　"Ahem! My trees are doing finely," observed Mr. W., senior,strolling along with his hands behind him, casting satisfied glancesat the dwarf orange, oleander, abutilon, and little pine thatrepresented his orchard.</p> 
<p>　　Suddenly he starts, pauses, frowns, and, after examining the lattershrub, which displayed several hacks in its stem and a broken limbwith six red-velvet cherries hanging on it, he gave a thump withhis cane that made the little ones jump, and cried out,"Can it have been my son?"He evidently thought it was, for he called, in tones of thunder,"George! George Washington, come hither this moment!"Great suspense on the part of the audience, then a general burst oflaughter as Boo trotted in, a perfect miniature of his honoredparent, knee breeches, cocked hat, shoe buckles and all. He was sofat that the little tails of his coat stuck out in the drollest way, hischubby legs could hardly carry the big buckles, and the rosy facedisplayed, when he took his hat off with a dutiful bow, was sosolemn, the real George could not have looked more anxious whenhe gave the immortal answer.</p> 
<p>　　"Sirrah, did you cut that tree?" demanded the papa, with anotherrap of the cane, and such a frown that poor Boo looked dismayed,till Molly wispered, "Put your hand up, dear." Then heremembered his part, and, putting one finger in his mouth, lookeddown at his square-toed shoes, the image of a shame-stricken boy.</p> 
<p>　　"My son, do not deceive me. If you have done this deed I shallchastise you, for it is my duty not to spare the rod, lest I spoil thechild. But if you lie about it you disgrace the name of Washingtonforever."This appeal seemed to convulse George with inward agony, for hesquirmed most effectively as he drew from his pocket a toyhatchet, which would not have cut a straw, then looking straight upinto the awe-inspiring countenance of his parent, he bravely lisped,"Papa, I tannot tell a lie. I'd id tut it with my little hanchet.""Noble boy--come to my arms! I had rather you spoilt all mycherry trees than tell one lie!" cried the delighted gentleman,catching his son in an embrace so close that the fat legs kickedconvulsively, and the little coat-tails waved in the breeze, whilecane and hatchet fell with a dramatic bang.</p> 
<p>　　The curtain descended on this affccting tableau; but the audiencecalled out both Washingtons, and they came, hand in hand, bowingwith the cocked hats pressed to their breasts, the elder smilingblandly, while the younger, still flushed by his exertions, nodded tohis friends, asking, with engaging frankness, "Wasn't it nice?"The next was a marine piece, for a boat was seen, surrounded bytumultuous waves of blue cambric, and rowed by a party ofstalwart men in regimentals, who with difficulty kept their seats,for the boat was only a painted board, and they sat on boxes orstools behind it. But few marked the rowers, for in their midst, tall,straight, and steadfast as a mast, stood one figure in a cloak, withfolded arms, high boots, and, under the turned-up hat, a noblecountenance, stern with indomitable courage. A sword glittered athis side, and a banner waved over him, but his eye was fixed onthe distant shore, and he was evidently unconscious of the roaringbillows, the blocks of ice, the discouragement of his men, or thedanger and death that might await him. Napoleon crossing theAlps was not half so sublime, and with one voice the audiencccried, 'Washington crossing the Delaware!" while the band burstforth with, "See, the conquering hero comes!" all out of tune, butbound to play it or die in the attempt.</p> 
<p>　　It would have been very successful if, all of a sudden, one of therowers had not "caught a crab" with disastrous consequences. Theoars were not moving, but a veteran, who looked very much likeJoe, dropped the one he held, and in trying to turn and pummel theblack-eyed warrior behind him, he tumbled off his seat, upsettingtwo other men, and pulling the painted boat upon them as they laykicking in the cambric deep. Shouts of laughter greeted thismishap, but George Washington never stirred. Grasping thebanner, he stood firm when all else went down in the generalwreck, and the icy waves engulfed his gallant crew, leaving himerect amid a chaos of wildly tossing boots, entangled oars, andred-faced victims. Such god-like dignity could not fail to impressthe frivolous crowd of laughers, and the curtain fell amid a roundof applause for him alone.</p> 
<p>　　"Quite exciting, wasn't it? Didn't know Gus had so much presenceof mind," said Mr. Burton, well pleased with his boy.</p> 
<p>　　"If we did not know that Washington died in his bed, December14, 1799, I should fear that we'd seen the last of him in thatshipwreck," laughed an old gentleman, proud of his memory fordates.</p> 
<p>　　Much confusion reigned behind the scenes; Ralph was heardscolding, and Joe set everyone off again by explaining, audibly,that Grif tickled him, and he couldn't stand it. A pretty,old-fashioned picture of the "Daughters of Liberty" followed, forthegirls were determined to do honor to the brave and patient womenwho so nobly bore their part in the struggle, yet are usuallyforgotten when those days are celebrated. The damsels werecharming in the big caps, flowered gowns, and high-heeled shoesof their great-grandmothers, as they sat about a spider-legged tabletalking over the tax, and pledging themselves to drink no more teatill it was taken off. Molly was on her feet proposing, "Libertyforever, and down with all tyrants," to judge from her flashing eyesas she held her egg-shell cup aloft, while the others lifted theirs todrink the toast, and Merry, as hostess, sat with her hand on anantique teapot, labelled "Sage," ready to fill again when thepatriotic ladies were ready for a second "dish."This was much applauded, and the curtain went up again, for theproud parents enjoyed seeing their pretty girls in the faded fineryof a hundred years ago. The band played "Auld Lang Syne," as agentle hint that our fore-mothers should be remembered as well asthe fore-fathers.</p> 
<p>　　It was evident that something very martial was to follow, for agreat tramping, clashing, and flying about took place behind thescenes while the tea-party was going on. After some delay, "TheSurrender of Cornwallis" was presented in the most superbmanner, as you can believe when I tell you that the stage wasactually lined with a glittering array of Washington and hisgenerals, Lafayette, Kosciusko, Rochambeau and the rest, all inastonishing uniforms, with swords which were evidently the prideof their lives. Fife and drum struck up a march, and in cameCornwallis, much cast down but full of manly resignation, as hesurrendered his sword, and stood aside with averted eyes while hisarmy marched past, piling their arms at the hero's feet.</p> 
<p>　　This scene was the delight of the boys, for the rifles of Company Fhad been secured, and at least a dozen soldiers kept filing in andout in British uniform till Washington's august legs were hidden bythe heaps of arms rattled down before him. The martial music, thesteady tramp, and the patriotic memories awakened, caused thisscene to be enthusiastically encored, and the boys would havegone on marching till midnight if Ralph had not peremptorilyordered down the curtain and cleared the stage for the nexttableau.</p> 
<p>　　This had been artfully slipped in between two brilliant ones, toshow that the Father of his Country had to pay a high price for hisglory. The darkened stage represented what seemed to be a campin a snow-storm, and a very forlorn camp, too; for on "the cold,cold ground" (a reckless display of cotton batting) lay raggedsoldiers, sleeping without blankets, their worn-out boots turned uppathetically, and no sign of food or fire to be seen. A very shabbysentinel, with feet bound in bloody cloths, and his face as pale aschalk could make it, gnawed a dry crust as he kept his watch in thewintry night.</p> 
<p>　　A tent at the back of the stage showed a solitary figure sitting on alog of wood, poring over the map spread upon his knee, by thelight of one candle stuck in a bottle. There could be no doubt whothis was, for the buff-and-blue coat, the legs, the nose, the attitude,all betrayed the great George laboring to save his country, in spiteof privations, discouragements, and dangers which would havedaunted any other man.</p> 
<p>　　"Valley Forge," said someone, and the room was very still as oldand young looked silently at this little picture of a great and noblestruggle in one of its dark hours. The crust, the wounded feet, therags, the snow, the loneliness, the indomitable courage andendurance of these men touched the hearts of all, for the mimicscene grew real for a moment; and, when a child's voice broke thesilence, asking pitifully, "Oh, mamma, was it truly as dreadful asthat?" a general outburst answered, as if everyone wanted to cheerup the brave fellows and bid them fight on, for victory was surelycoming.</p> 
<p>　　In the next scene it did come, and "Washington at Trenton" wasprettily done. An arch of flowers crossed the stage, with the motto,"The Defender of the Mothers will be the Preserver of theDaughters"; and, as the hero with his generals advanced on oneside, a troop of girls, in old-fashioned muslin frocks, came toscatter flowers before him, singing the song of long ago:</p> 
<p>　　"Welcome, mighty chief, once moreWelcome to this grateful shore;Now no mercenary foeeyes as she held her egg-shell cup aloft, while the others liftedtheirs to drink the toast, and Merry, as hostess, sat with her handon an antique teapot, labelled "Sage," ready to fill again when thepatriotic ladies were ready for a second "dish."This was much applauded, and the curtain went up again, for theproud parents enjoyed seeing their pretty girls in the faded fineryof a hundred years ago. The band played "Auld Lang Syne," as agentle hint that our fore-mothers should be remembered as well asthe fore-fathers.</p>

<p>　　This had been artfully slipped in between two brilliant ones, toshow that the Father of his Country had to pay a high price for hisglory. The darkened stage represented what seemed to beAims again the fatal blow,Aims at thee the fatal blow.</p> 
<p>　　"Virgins fair and matrons grave,Those thy conquering arm did save,Build for thee triumphal bowers;Strew, ye fair, his way with flowers,Strew your hero's -way with flowers."And they did, singing with all their hearts as they flung artificialroses and lilies at the feet of the great men, who bowed withbenign grace. Jack, who did Lafayette with a limp, covered himselfwith glory by picking up one of the bouquets and pressing it to hisheart with all the gallantry of a Frenchman; and when Washingtonlifted the smallest of the maids and kissed her, the audiencecheered. Couldn't help it, you know, it was so pretty and inspiring.</p> 
<p>　　The Washington Family, after the famous picture, came next, withAnnette as the serene and sensible Martha, in a very becoming cap.</p> 
<p>　　The General was in uniform, there being no time to change, but hisattitude was quite correct, and the Custis boy and girl displayed thewide sash and ruffled collar with historic fidelity. The band played"Home," and everyone agreed that it was "Sweet!""Now I don't see what more they can have except the deathbed,and that would be rather out of place in this gay company," saidthe old gentleman to Mr. Burton, as he mopped his heated faceafter pounding so heartily he nearly knocked the ferule off hiscane.</p> 
<p>　　"No; they gave that up, for my boy wouldn't wear a night-gown inpublic. I can't tell secrets, but I think they have got a very cleverlittle finale for the first part--a pretty compliment to one personand a pleasant surprise to all," answered Mr. Burton, who was ingreat spirits, being fond of theatricals and very justly proud of hischildren, for the little girls had been among the Trenton maids, andthe mimic General had kissed his own small sister, Nelly, verytenderly.</p> 
<p>　　A great deal of interest was felt as to what this surprise was to be,and a general "Oh!" greeted the "Minute Man," standingmotionless upon his pedestal. It was Frank, and Ralph had done hisbest to have the figure as perfect as possible, for the maker of theoriginal had been a good friend to him; and, while the youngsculptor was dancing gayly at the ball, this copy of his work wasdoing him honor among the children. Frank looked it very well, forhis firm-set mouth was full of resolution, his eyes shone keen andcourageous under the three-cornered hat, and the muscles stoodout upon the bare arm that clutched the old gun. Even the buttonson the gaiters seemed to flash defiance, as the sturdy legs took thefirst step from the furrow toward the bridge where the youngfarmer became a hero when he "fired the shot heard 'round theworld.""That is splendid!" "As like to the original as flesh can be tobronze." "How still he stands!" "He'll fight when the time comes,and die hard, won't he?" "Hush! You make the statue blush!" Thesevery audible remarks certainly did, for the color rose visibly as themodest lad heard himself praised, though he saw but one face inall the crowd, his mother's, far back, but full of love and pride, asshe looked up at her young minute man waiting for the battlewhich often calls us when we least expect it, and for which shehad done her best to make him ready.</p> 
<p>　　If there had been any danger of Frank being puffed up by thesuccess of his statue, it was counteracted by irrepressible Grif,who, just at the most interesting moment, when all were gazingsilently, gave a whistle, followed by a "Choo, choo, choo!" and"All aboard!" so naturally that no one could mistake the joke,especially as another laughing voice added, "Now, then, No. 11!"which brought down the house and the curtain too.</p> 
<p>　　Frank was so angry, it was very difficult to keep him on his perchfor the last scene of all. He submitted, however, rather than spoilthe grand finale, hoping that its beauty would efface that ill-timedpleasantry from the public mind. So, when the agreeable clamor ofhands and voices called for a repetition, the Minute Manreappeared, grimmer than before. But not alone, for grouped allabout his pedestal were Washington and his generals, the matronsand maids, with a background of troops shouldering arms, Grif andJoe doing such rash things with their muskets, that more than onehero received a poke in his august back. Before the full richness ofthis picture had been taken in, Ed gave a rap, and all burst out with"Hail Columbia," in such an inspiring style that it was impossiblefor the audience to refrain from joining, which they did, allstanding and all singing with a heartiness that made the walls ring.</p> 
<p>　　The fife shrilled, the horn blew sweet and clear, the fiddle wasnearly drowned by the energetic boom of the drum, and out intothe starry night, through open windows, rolled the song that stirsthe coldest heart with patriotic warmth and tunes every voice tomusic.</p> 
<p>　　"'America!' We must have 'America!' Pipe up, Ed, this is too goodto end without one song more," cried Mr. Burton, who had beensinging like a trumpet; and, hardly waiting to get their breath, offthey all went again with the national hymn, singing as they neverhad sung it before, for somehow the little scenes they had justacted or beheld seemed to show how much this dear America ofours had cost in more than one revolution, how full of courage,energy, and virtue it was in spite of all its faults, and what aprivilege, as well as duty, it was for each to do his part toward itssafety and its honor in the present, as did those brave men andwomen in the past.</p> 
<p>　　So the "Scenes from the Life of Washington" were a great success,and, when the songs were over, people were glad of a brief recesswhile they had raptures, and refreshed themselves with lemonade.</p> 
<p>　　The girls had kept the secret of who the "Princess" was to be, and,when the curtain rose, a hum of surprise and pleasure greeted thepretty group. Jill lay asleep in all her splendor, the bonny "Prince"just lifting the veil to wake her with a kiss, and all about them thecourt in its nap of a hundred years. The "King" and "Queen"dozing comfortably on the throne; the maids of honor, like agarland of nodding flowers, about the couch; the little page,unconscious of the blow about to fall, and the fool dreaming, withhis mouth wide open.</p> 
<p>　　It was so pretty, people did not tire of looking, till Jack's lame legbegan to tremble, and he whispered: "Drop her or I shall pitch."Down went the curtain; but it rose in a moment, and there was thecourt after the awakening: the "King" and "Queen" looking aboutthem with sleepy dignity, the maids in various attitudes of surprise,the fool grinning from ear to ear, and the "Princess" holding outher hand to the "Prince," as if glad to welcome the right loverwhen he came at last.</p> 
<p>　　Molly got the laugh this time, for she could not resist giving poorBoo the cuff which had been hanging over him so long. She gave itwith unconscious energy, and Boo cried "Ow!" so naturally that allthe children were delighted and wanted it repeated. But Boodeclined, and the scenes which followed were found quite as muchto their taste, having been expressly prepared for the little people.</p> 
<p>　　Mother Goose's Reception was really very funny, for Ralph wasthe old lady, and had hired a representation of the immortal birdfrom a real theatre for this occasion. There they stood, the dame inher pointed hat, red petticoat, cap, and cane, with the noble fowl, agood deal larger than life, beside her, and Grif inside, enjoyinghimself immensely as he flapped the wings, moved the yellowlegs, and waved the long neck about, while unearthly quacksissued from the bill. That was a great surprise for the children, andthey got up in their seats to gaze their fill, many of them firmlybelieving that they actually beheld the blessed old woman whowrote the nursery songs they loved so well.</p> 
<p>　　Then in came, one after another, the best of the characters she hasmade famous, while a voice behind the scenes sang the properrhyme as each made their manners to the interesting pair.</p> 
<p>　　"Mistress Mary," and her "pretty maids all in a row," passed by totheir places in the background; "King Cole" and his "fiddlersthree" made a goodly show; so did the royal couple, who followedthe great pie borne before them, with the "four-and-twentyblackbirds" popping their heads out in the most delightful way.</p> 
<p>　　Little "Bo-Peep" led a wooiiy lamb and wept over its lost tail, fornot a sign of one appeared on the poor thing. "Simple Simon"followed the pie-man, gloating over his wares with the drollestantics. The little wife came trundling by in a wheelbarrow and wasnot upset; neither was the lady with "rings on her fingers and bellson her toes," as she cantered along on a rocking-horse. "BobbyShafto's" yellow hair shone finely as he led in the maid whom hecame back from sea to marry. "Miss Muffet," bowl in hand, ranaway from an immense black spider, which waggled its long legsin a way so life-like that some of the children shook in their littleshoes. The beggars who came to town were out in full force, "rags,tags, and velvet gowns," quite true to life. "Boy Blue" rubbed hiseyes, with hay sticking in his hair, and tooted on a tin horn as ifbound to get the cows out of the corn. Molly, with a long-handledfrying-pan, made a capital "Queen," in a tucked-up gown, checkedapron, and high crown, to good "King Arthur," who, very properly,did not appear after stealing the barley-meal, which might be seenin the pan tied up in a pudding, like a cannon-ball, ready to fry.</p> 
<p>　　But Tobias, Molly's black cat, covered himself with glory by thespirit with which he acted his part in,"Sing, sing, what shall I sing?</p> 
<p>　　The cat's run away with the pudding-bag string."First he was led across the stage on his hind legs, looking veryfierce and indignant, with a long tape trailing behind him; and,being set free at the proper moment, he gave one bound over thefour-and-twenty blackbirds who happened to be in the way, anddashed off as if an enraged cook had actually been after him,straight downstairs to the coal-bin, where he sat glaring in thedark, till the fun was over.</p> 
<p>　　When all the characters had filed in and stood in two long rows,music struck up and they'd anced, "All the way to Boston," asimple but lively affair, which gave each a chance to show his orher costume as they pranced down the middle and up outside.</p> 
<p>　　Such a funny medley as it was, for there went fat "King Cole" withthe most ragged of the beggar-maids. "Mistress Mary," in herpretty blue dress, tripped along with "Simple Simon" staring abouthim like a blockhead. The fine lady left her horse to dance with"Bobby Shafto" till every bell on her slippers tinkled its tongueout. "Bo-Peep" and a jolly fiddler skipped gayly up and down.</p> 
<p>　　"Miss Muffet" took the big spider for her partner, and made hismany legs fly about in the wildest way. The little wife got out ofthe wheelbarrow to help "Boy Blue" along, and Molly, with thefrying-pan over her shoulder, led off splendidly when it was"Grand right and left."But the old lady and her goose were the best of all, for the dame'sshoes-buckles cut the most astonishing pigeon-wings, and to seethat mammoth bird waddle down the middle with its wings halfopen, its long neck bridling, and its yellow legs in the first positionas it curtsied to its partner, was a sight to remember, it was sointensely funny.</p> 
<p>　　The merry old gentleman laughed till he cried; Mr. Burton split hisgloves, he applauded so enthusiastically; while the children beatthe dust out of the carpet hopping up and down, as they cried: "Doit again!" "We want it all over!" when the curtain went down at laston the flushed and panting party, Mother G----bowing, with her hatall awry, and the goose doing a double shuffle as if it did not knowhow to leave off.</p> 
<p>　　But they could not "do it all over again," for it was growing late,and the people felt that they certainly had received their money'sworth that evening.</p> 
<p>　　So it all ended merrily, and when the guests departed the boyscleared the room like magic, and the promised supper to the actorswas served in handsome style. Jack and Jill were at one end, Mrs.</p> 
<p>　　Goose and her bird at the other, and all between was a comicalcollection of military heroes, fairy characters, and nurserycelebrities. All felt the need of refreshment after their labors, andswept over the table like a flight of locusts, leaving devastationbehind. But they had earned their fun: and much innocent jollityprevailed, while a few lingering papas and mammas watched therevel from afar, and had not the heart to order these noble beingshome till even the Father of his Country declared "that he'd had aperfectly splendid time, but couldn't keep his eyes open anotherminute," and very wisely retired to replace the immortal cockedhat with a night-cap.</p>
