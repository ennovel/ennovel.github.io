<p>　　"Never mind the clothes, we only want a boating-suit apiece.</p> 
<p>　　Mamma can put a few collars in her trunk for us; but thesenecessary things must go," answered Jack, adding his target andair-pistol to the pile of bats, fishing-tackle, games, and a choicecollection of shabby balls.</p> 
<p>　　"Those are the necessaries and clothes the luxuries, are they? Whydon't you add a velocipede, wheelbarrow, and printing-press, mydear?" asked Mrs. Pecq, while Jill turned up her nose at "boys'</p> 
<p>　　rubbish.""Wish I could. Dare say we shall want them. Women don't knowwhat fellows need, and always must put in a lot of stiff shirts andclean handkerchiefs and clothes-brushes and pots of cold cream.</p> 
<p>　　We are going to rough it, and don't want any fuss and feathers,"said Jack, beginning to pack the precious balls in his rubber boots,and strap them up with the umbrellas, rods, and bats, seeing thatthere was no hope of a place in the trunk.</p> 
<p>　　Here Frank came in with two big books, saying calmly, "Just slipthese in somewhere, we shall need them.""But you are not to study at all, so you won't want those greatdictionaries," cried Jill, busily packing her new travelling-basketwith all sorts of little rolls, bags, and boxes.</p> 
<p>　　"They are not dics, but my Encyclopedia. We shall want to knowheaps of things, and this tells about everything. With those books,and a microscope and a telescope, you could travel round theworld, and learn all you wanted to. Can't possibly get on withoutthem," said Frank, fondly patting his favorite work.</p> 
<p>　　"My patience! What queer cattle boys are!" exclaimed Mrs. Pecq,while they all laughed. "It can't be done, Mr. Frank; all the boxesare brim full, and you'll have to leave those fat books behind, forthere's no place anywhere.""Then I'll carry them myself"; and Frank tucked one under eacharm, with a determined air, which settled the matter.</p> 
<p>　　"I suppose you'll study cockleology instead of boating, and read upon polywogs while we play tennis, or go poking round with yourold spy-glass instead of having a jolly good time," said Jack,hauling away on the strap till all was taut and ship-shape with thebundle.</p> 
<p>　　"Tadpoles don't live in salt water, my son, and if you meanconchology, you'd better say so. I shall play as much as I wish, andwhen I want to know about any new or curious thing, I shallconsult my Cyclo, instead of bothering other people withquestions, or giving it up like a dunce"; with which crushing replyFrank departed, leaving Jill to pack and unpack her treasures adozen times, and Jack to dance jigs on the lids of the trunks tillthey would shut.</p> 
<p>　　A very happy party set off the next day, leaving Mrs. Pecq wavingher apron on the steps. Mrs. Minot carried the lunch, Jack hisprecious bundle with trifles dropping out by the way, and Jill feltvery elegant bearing her new basket with red worsted cherriesbobbing on the outside. Frank actually did take the Encyclopedia,done up in the roll of shawls, and whenever the others wonderedabout anything--tides, lighthouses, towns, or natural productions--he brought forth one of the books and triumphantly read therefrom,to the great merriment, if not edification, of his party.</p> 
<p>　　A very short trip by rail and the rest of the journey by boat, to Jill'sgreat contentment, for she hated to be shut up; and while the ladsroved here and there she sat under the awning, too happy to talk.</p> 
<p>　　But Mrs. Minot watched with real satisfaction how the fresh windblew the color back into the pale cheeks, how the eyes shone andthe heart filled with delight at seeing the lovely world again, andbeing able to take a share in its active pleasures.</p> 
<p>　　The Willows was a long, low house close to the beach, and as fullas a beehive of pleasant people, all intent on having a good time. Agreat many children were swarming about, and Jill found itimpossible to sleep after her journey, there was such a livelyclatter of tongues on the piazzas, and so many feet going to and froin the halls, She lay down obediently while Mrs. Minot settledmatters in the two airy rooms and gave her some dinner, but shekept popping up her head to look out of the window to see whatshe could see. Just opposite stood an artist's cottage and studio,with all manner of charming galleries, towers, steps, and even asort of drawbridge to pull up when the painter wished to be left inpeace. He was absent now, and the visitors took possession of thisfine play-place. Children were racing up and down the galleries,ladies sitting in the tower, boys disporting themselves on the roof,and young gentlemen preparing for theatricals in the large studio.</p> 
<p>　　"What fun I'll have over there," thought Jill, watching the merryscene with intense interest, and wondering if the little girls she sawwere as nice as Molly and Merry.</p> 
<p>　　Then there were glimpses of the sea beyond the green bank wherea path wound along to the beach, whence came the cool dash ofwaves, and now and then the glimmer of a passing sail.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, when can I go out? It looks so lovely, I can't wait long," shesaid, looking as eager as a little gull shut up in a cage and piningfor its home on the wide ocean.</p> 
<p>　　"As soon as it is a little cooler, dear, I'm getting ready for our trip,but we must be careful and not do too much at once. 'Slow andsure' is our motto," answered Mrs. Minot, busily collecting thecamp-stools, the shawls, the air-cushions, and the big parasols.</p> 
<p>　　"I'll be good, only do let me have my sailor-hat to wear, and mynew suit. I'm not a bit tired, and I do want to be like other folksright off," said Jill, who had been improving rapidly of late, andfelt much elated at being able to drive out nearly every day, towalk a little, and sit up some hours without any pain or fatigue.</p> 
<p>　　To gratify her, the blue flannel suit with its white trimming wasput on, and Mamma was just buttoning the stout boots when Jackthundered at the door, and burst in with all sorts of glorious news.</p> 
<p>　　"Do come out, mother, it's perfectly splendid on the beach! I'vefound a nice place for Jill to sit, and it's only a step. Lots of capitalfellows here; one has a bicycle, and is going to teach us to ride. Noend of fun up at the hotel, and everyone seems glad to see us. Twoladies asked about Jill, and one of the girls has got some shells allready for her, Gerty Somebody, and her mother is so pretty andjolly, I like her ever so much. They sit at our table, and Wally isthe boy, younger than I am, but very pleasant. Bacon is the fellowin knickerbockers; just wish you could see what stout legs he's got!</p> 
<p>　　Cox is the chap for me, though: we are going fishing to-morrow.</p> 
<p>　　He's got a sweet-looking mother, and a sister for you, Jill. Now,then, do come on, I'll take the traps."Off they went, and Jill thought that very short walk to the shore themost delightful she ever took; for people smiled at the little invalidas she went slowly by leaning on Mrs. Minot's arm, while Jackpranced in front, doing the honors, as if he owned the wholeAtlantic. A new world opened to her eyes as they came out uponthe pebbly beach full of people enjoying their afternoonpromenade. Jill save one rapturous Oh. and then sat on her stool,forgetting everything but the beautiful blue ocean rolling away tomeet the sky, with nothing to break the wide expanse but a sailhere and there, a point of rocks on one hand, the little pier on theother, and white gulls skimming by on their wide wings.</p> 
<p>　　While she sat enjoying herself, Jack showed his mother the placehe had found, and a very nice one it was. Just under the green banklay an old boat propped up with some big stones. A willowdrooped over it, the tide rippled up within a few yards of it, and afine view of the waves could be seen as they'd ashed over therocks at the point.</p> 
<p>　　"Isn't it a good cubby-house? Ben Cox and I fixed it for Jill, andshe can have it for hers. Put her cushions and things there on thesand the children have thrown in--that will make it soft; then theseseats will do for tables; and up in the bow I'm going to have thatold rusty tin boiler full of salt-water, so she can put seaweed andcrabs and all sorts 0c chaps in h for an aquatium, you know,"explained Jack, greatly interested in establishing his familycomfortably before he left them.</p> 
<p>　　"There couldn't be a nicer place, and it is very kind of you to get itready. Spread the shawls and settle Jill, then you needn't think ofus any more, but go and scramble with Frank. I see him over therewith his spy-glass and some pleasant-looking boys," said Mamma,bustling about in great spirits.</p> 
<p>　　So the red cushions were placed, the plaids laid, and the littlework-basket set upon the seat, all ready for Jill, who was charmedwith her nest, and cuddled down under the big parasol, declaringshe would keep house there every day.</p> 
<p>　　Even the old boiler pleased her, and Jack raced over the beach tobegin his search for inhabitants for the new aquarium, leaving Jillto make friends with some pretty babies digging in the sand, whileMamma sat on the camp-stool and talked with a friend fromHarmony Village.</p> 
<p>　　It seemed as if there could not be anything more delightful than tolie there lulled by the sound of the sea, watching the sunset andlistening to the pleasant babble of little voices close by. But whenthcy went to tea in the great hall, with six tables full of merrypeople, and half a dozen maids flying about, Jill thought that waseven better, because it was so new to her. Gerty and Wally noddedto her, and their pretty mamma was so kind and so gay, rhat Jillcould not feel bashful after the first few minutes, and soon lookedabout her, sure of seeing friendly faces everywhere. Frank and Jackate as if the salt air bad already improved their appetites, aridtalked about Bacon and Cox as if they had been bosom friends foryears. Mamma was as happy as they for her friend, Mrs.</p> 
<p>　　Hammond, sat close by; and this rosy lady, who had been aphysician, cheered her up by predicting that Jill would soon berunning about as well as ever.</p> 
<p>　　But the best of all was in the evening, when the elder peoplegathered in the parlors and played Twenty Questions, while thechildren looked on for an hour before going to bed, much amusedat the sight of grown people laughing, squabbling, dodging, andjoking as if they had all become young again; for, as everyoneknows, it is impossible to help lively skirmishes when that game isplayed. Jill lay in the sofa corner enjoying it all immensely; for shenever saw anything so droll, and found it capital fun to help guessthe thing, or try to puzzle the opposite side. Her quick wits andbright face attracted people, and in the pauses of the sport she heldquite a levee, for everybody was interested in the little invalid. Thegirls shyly made friends in their own way, the mammas toldthrilling tales of the accidents their darlings had survived, severalgentlemen kindly offered their boats, and the boys, with the bestintentions in life, suggested strolls of two or three miles to Rafe'sChasm and Norman's Woe, or invited her to tennis and archery, asif violent exercise was the cure for all human ills. She was verygrateful, and reluctantly went away to bed, declaring, when she gotupstairs, that these new friends were the dearest people she evermet, and the Willows the most delightful place in the whole world.</p> 
<p>　　Next day a new life began for the young folks--a very healthy,happy life; and all threw themselves into it so heartily, that it wasimpossible to help getting great good from it, for these summerweeks, if well spent, work miracles in tired bodies and souls.</p> 
<p>　　Frank took a fancy to the bicycle boy, and, being able to hire oneof the breakneck articles, soon learned to ride it; and the two mightbe seen wildly working their long legs on certain smooth stretchesof road, or getting up their muscle rowing about the bay till theywere almost as brown and nautical in appearance and language asthe fishermen who lived in nooks and corners along the shore.</p> 
<p>　　Jack struck up a great friendship with the sturdy Bacon and theagreeable Cox: the latter, being about his own age, was hisespecial favorite; and they soon were called Box and Cox by theother fellows, which did not annoy them a bit, as both had playedparts in that immortal farce. They had capital times fishing,scrambling over the rocks, playing ball and tennis, and rainy daysthey took possession of the studio opposite, drew up the portcullis,and gallantly defended the castle, which some of the othersbesieged with old umbrellas for shields, bats for battering-rams,and bunches of burrs for cannon-balls. Great larks went on overthere, while the girls applauded from the piazza orchamber-windows, and made a gay flag for the victors to displayfrom the tower when the fight was over.</p> 
<p>　　But Jill had the best time of all, for each day brought increasingstrength and spirits, and she improved so fast it was hard to believethat she was the same girl who lay so long almost helpless in theBird Room at home. Such lively letters as she sent her W1o~he~,all aboul her new friends, her fine sails, drives, and little walks;the good times she had in the evening, the lovely things peoplegave her, and she was learning to make with shells and sea-weed,and what splendid fun it was to keep house in a boat.</p> 
<p>　　This last amusement soon grew quite absorbing, and her "cubby,"as she called it, rapidly became a pretty grotto, where she livedlike a little mermaid, daily loving more and more the beauty of thewonderful sea, Finding the boat too sunny at times, the boys cutlong willow boughs and arched them over the seats, layinghemlock branches across till a green roof made it cool and shadyinside. There Jill sat or lay among her cushions reading, trying tosketch, sorting shells, drying gay sea-weeds, or watching her crabs,jelly-fish, and anemones in the old boiler, now buried in sand andedged about with moss from the woods.</p> 
<p>　　Nobody disturbed her treasures, but kindly added to them, andoften when she went to her nest she found fruit or flowers, booksor bon-bons, laid ready for her. Everyone pitied and liked thebright little girl who could not run and frisk with the rest, who wasso patient and cheerful after her long confinement, ready to helpothers, and so grateful for any small favor. She found now that theweary months had not been wasted, and was very happy todiscover in herself a new sort of strength and sweetness that wasnot only a comfort to her, but made those about her love and trusther. The songs she had learned attracted the babies, who wouldleave their play to peep at her and listen when she sung over herwork. Passers-by paused to hear the blithe voice of the bird in thegreen cage, and other invalids, strolling on the beach, would takeheart when they saw the child so happy in spite of her great trial.</p> 
<p>　　The boys kept all their marine curiosities for her, and were alwaysready to take her a row or a sail, as the bay was safe and that sortof travelling suited her better than driving. But the girls had capitaltimes together, and it did Jill good to see another sort from thoseshe knew at home. She had been so much petted of late, that shewas getting rather vain of her small accomplishments, and beingwith strangers richer, better bred and educated than herself, madeher more humble in some things, while it showed her the worth ofsuch virtues as she could honestly claim. Mamie Cox took her todrive in the fine carriage of her mamma, and Jill was muchimpressed by the fact that Mamie was not a bit proud about it, anddid not put on any airs, though she had a maid to take care of her.</p> 
<p>　　Gerty wore pretty costumes, and came down with pink and blueribbons in her hair that Jill envied very much; yet Gerty liked hercurls, and longed to have some, while her mother, "the lady fromPhiladelphia," as they called her, was so kind and gay that Jillquite adored her, and always felt as if sunshine had come into theroom when she entered. Two little sisters were very interesting toher, and made her long for one of her own when she saw themgoing about together and heard them talk of their pleasant home,where the great silk factories were. But they invited her to comeand see the wonderful cocoons, and taught her to knot pretty grayfringe on a cushion, which delighted her, being so new and easy.</p> 
<p>　　There were several other nice little lasses, and they all gatheredabout Jill with the sweet sympathy children are so quick to showtoward those in pain or misfortune. She thought they would notcare for a poor little girl like herself, yet here she was the queen ofthe troupe, and this discovery touched and pleased her very much.</p> 
<p>　　In the morning they camped round the boat on the stones withbooks, gay work, and merry chatter, till bathing-time. Then thebeach was full of life and fun, for everyone looked so droll in theflannel suits, it was hard to believe that the neat ladies andrespectable gentlemen who went into the little houses could be thesame persons as the queer, short-skirted women with old hats tieddown, and bareheaded, barefooted men in old suits, who cameskipping over the sand to disport themselves in the sea in the mostundignified ways. The boys raced about, looking like circus-tumblers, and the babies were regular little cupids, running awayfrom the waves that tried to kiss their flying feet.</p> 
<p>　　Some of the young ladies and girls were famous swimmers, andlooked very pretty in their bright red and blue costumes, with loosehair and gay stockings, as they'd anced into the water and floatedaway as fearlessly as real mermaidens. Jill had her quiet dip andgood rubbing each fine day, and then lay upon the warm sandwatching the pranks of the others, and longing to run and dive andshout and tumble with the rest. Now that she was among the welland active, it seemed harder to be patient than when shut up andunable to stir. She felt so much better, and had so little pain toremind her of past troubles, it was almost impossible to helpforgetting the poor back and letting her recovered spirits run awaywith her. If Mrs. Minot had not kept good watch, she would havebeen off more than once, so eager was she to be "like other girls"again, so difficult was it to keep the restless feet quietly foldedamong the red cushions.</p> 
<p>　　One day she did yield to temptation, and took a little voyage whichmight have been her last, owing to the carelessness of those whomshe trusted. It was a good lesson, and made her as meek as a lambduring the rest of her stay. Mrs. Minot drove to Gloucester oneafternoon, leaving Jill safely established after her nap in the boat,with Gerty and Mamie making lace beside her.</p> 
<p>　　"Don't try to walk or run about, my dear. Sit on the piazza if youget tired of this, and amuse yourself quietly till I come back. I'llnot forget the worsted and the canvas," said Mamma, peeping overthe bank for a last word as she waited for the omnibus to comealong.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, don't forget the Gibraltars!" cried Jill, popping her head out ofthe green roof.</p> 
<p>　　"Nor the bananas, please!" added Gerty, looking round one end.</p> 
<p>　　"Nor the pink and blue ribbon to tie our shell-baskets," calledMamie, nearly tumbling into the aquarium at the other end.</p> 
<p>　　Mrs. Minot laughed, and promised, and rumbled away, leaving Jillto an experience which she never forgot.</p> 
<p>　　For half an hour the little girls worked busily, then the boys camefor Gerty and Mamie to go to the Chasm with a party of friendswho were to leave next day. Off they went, and Jill felt very lonelyas the gay voices died away. Everyone had gone somewhere, andonly little Harry Hammond and his maid were on the beach. Twoor three sand-pipers ran about among the pebbles, and Jill enviedthem their nimble legs so much, that she could not resist getting upto take a few steps. She longed to run straight away over the firm,smooth sand, and feel again the delight of swift motion; but shedared not try it, and stood leaning on her tall parasol with herbook in her hand, when Frank, Jack, and the bicycle boy camerowing lazily along and hailed her.</p> 
<p>　　"Come for a sail, Jill? Take you anywhere you like," called Jack,touched by the lonely figure on the beach.</p> 
<p>　　"I'd love to go, if you will row. Mamma made me promise not togo sailing without a man to take care of me. Would it spoil yourfun to have me?" answered Jill, eagerly.</p> 
<p>　　"Not a bit; come out on the big stones and we'll take you aboard,"said Frank, as they steered to the place where she could embark theeasiest.</p> 
<p>　　"All the rest are gone to the Chasm. I wanted to go, because I'venever seen it; but, of course, I had to give it up, as I do most of thefun"; and Jill sat down with an impatient sigh.</p> 
<p>　　"We'll row you round there. Can't land, but you can see the placeand shout to the others, if that will be any comfort to you,"proposed Frank, as they pulled away round the pier.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, yes, that would be lovely!" and Jill smiled at Jack, who wassteering, for she found it impossible to be dismal now with thefresh wind blowing in her face, the blue waves slapping against theboat, and three good-natured lads ready to gratify her wishes.</p> 
<p>　　Away they went, laughing and talking gayly till they came toGoodwin's Rocks, where an unusual number of people were to beseen though the tide was going out, and no white spray wasdashing high into the air to make a sight worth seeing.</p> 
<p>　　'What do you suppose they are about? Never saw such a lot offolks at this time. Shouldn't wonder if something had happened. Isay, put me ashore, and I'll cut up and see," said the bicycle boy,who was of an inquiring turn.</p> 
<p>　　"I'll go with you," said Frank; "it won't take but a minute, and I'dlike to discover what it is. Maybe something we ought to knowabout."So the boys pulled round into a quiet nook, and the two elder onesscrambled up the rocks, to disappear in the crowd. Five, ten,fifteen minutes passed, and they did not return. Jack grewimpatient, so did Jill, and bade him run up and bring them back.</p> 
<p>　　Glad to know what kept them, Jack departed, to be swallowed upin his turn, for not a sign of a boy did she see after that; and,having vainly strained her eyes to discover the attraction whichheld them, she gave it up, lay down on their jackets, and began toread.</p> 
<p>　　Then the treacherous tide, as it ebbed lower and lower down thebeach, began to lure the boat away; for it was not fastened, andwhen lightened of its load was an easy prize to the hungry sea,always ready to steal all it can. Jill knew nothing of this, for herstory was dull, the gentle motion proved soothing, and before sheknew it she was asleep. Little by little the runaway boat slid fartherfrom the shore, and presently was floating out to sea with itsdrowsy freight, while the careless boys, unconscious of the timethey were wasting, lingered to see group after group photographedby the enterprising man who had trundled his camera to the rocks.</p> 
<p>　　In the midst of a dream about home, Jill was roused by a loudshout, and, starting up so suddenly that the sun-umbrella wentoverboard, she found herself sailing off alone, while the distractedlads roared and beckoned vainly from the cove. The oars lay attheir feet, where they left them; and the poor child was quitehelpless, for she could not manage the sail, and even the parasol,with which she might have paddled a little, had gone down with allsail set. For a minute, Jill was so frightened that she could onlylook about her with a scared face, and wonder if drowning was avery disagreeable thing. Then the sight of the bicycle boystruggling with Jack, who seemed inclined to swim after her, andFrank shouting wildly, "Hold on! Come back!" made her laugh inspite of her fear, it was so comical, and their distress so muchgreater than hers, since it was their own carelessness which causedthe trouble.</p> 
<p>　　"I can't come back! There's nothing to hold on to! You didn't fastenme, and now I don't know where I'm going!" cried Jill, lookingfrom the shore to the treacherous sea that was gently carrying heraway.</p> 
<p>　　"Keep cool! We'll get a boat and come after you,~ roared Frank,before he followed Jack, who had collected his wits and wastearing up the rocks like a chamois hunter.</p> 
<p>　　The bicycle boy calmly sat down to keep his eye on the runaway,calling out from time to time such cheering remarks as "All aboardfor Liverpool! Give my love to Victoria! Luff and bear away whenyou come to Halifax! If you are hard up for provisions, you'll findan apple and some bait in my coat-pocket," and other directions fora comfortable voyage, till his voice was lost in the distance as astronger current bore her swiftly away and the big waves began totumble and splash.</p> 
<p>　　At first Jill had laughed at his efforts to keep up her spirits, butwhen the boat floated round a point of rock that shut in the cove,she felt all alone, and sat quite still, wondering what wouldbecome of her. She turned her back to the sea and looked at thedear, safe land, which never had seemed so green and beautifulbefore. Up on the hill rustled the wood through which the happyparty were wandering to the Chasm. On the rocks she still saw thecrowd all busy with their own affairs, unconscious of her danger.</p> 
<p>　　Here and there artists were sketching in picturesque spots, and inone place an old gentleman sat fishing peacefully. Jill called andwaved her handkerchief, but he never looked up, and an ugly littledog barked at her in what seemed to her a most cruel way.</p> 
<p>　　"Nobody sees or hears or cares, and those horrid boys will nevercatch up!" she cried in despair, as the boat began to rock more andmore, and the loud swash of water dashing in and out of theChasm drew nearer and nearer. Holding on now with both handsshe turned and looked straight before her, pale and shivering,while her eyes tried to see some sign of hope among the steepcliffs that rose up on the left. No one was there, though usually atthis hour they were full of visitors, and it was time for the walkersto have arrived.</p> 
<p>　　"I wonder if Gerty and Mamie will be sorry if I'm drowned,"thought Jill, remembering the poor girl who had been lost in theChasm not long ago. Her lively fancy pictured the grief of herfriends at her loss; but that did not help or comfort her now, and asher anxious gaze wandered along the shore, she said aloud, in apensive tone,"Perhaps I shall be wrecked on Norman's Woe, and somebody willmake poetry about me. It would be pretty to read, but I don't wantto die that way. Oh, why did I come! Why didn't I stay safe andcomfortable in my own boat?"At the thought a sob rose, and poor Jill laid her head down on herlap to cry with all her heart, feeling very helpless, small, andforsaken alone there on the great sea. In the midst of her tearscame the thought, "When people are in danger, they ask God tosave them"; and, slipping down upon her knees, she said her prayeras she had never said it before, for when human help seems gonewe turn to Him as naturally as lost children cry to their father, andfeel sure that he will hear and answer them.</p> 
<p>　　After that she felt better, and wiped away the drops that blindedher, to look out again like a shipwrecked mariner watching for asail. And there it was! Close by, coming swiftly on with a manbehind it, a sturdy brown fisher, busy with his lobster-pots, andquite unconscious how like an angel he looked to the helpless littlegirl in the rudderless boat.</p> 
<p>　　"Hi! hi! Oh, please do stop and get me! I'm lost, no oars, nobody tofix the sail! Oh, oh! please come!" screamed Jill, waving her hatfrantically as the other boat skimmed by and the man stared at heras if she really was a mermaid with a fishy tail.</p> 
<p>　　"Keep still! I'll come about and fetch you!" he called out; and Jillobeyed, sitting like a little image of faith, till with a good deal ofshifting and flapping of the sail, the other boat came alongside andtook her in tow,A few words told the story, and in five minutes she was sittingsnugly tucked up watching art unpleasant mass of lobsters flapabout dangerously near her toes, while the boat bounded over thewaves with a delightful motion, and every instant brought hernearer borne. She did not say much, but felt a good deal; and whenthey met two boats coming to meet her, manned by very anxiouscrews of men and boys, she was so pale and quiet that Jack wasquite bowed down with remorse, and Frank nearly pitched thebicycle boy overboard because he gayly asked Jill how she left herfriends in England. There was great rejoicing over her, for thepeople on the rocks had heard of her loss, and ran about like antswhen their hill is disturbed. Of course half a dozen amiable soulsposted off to the Willows to tell the family that the little girl wasdrowned, so that when the rescuers appeared quite a crowd wasassembled on the beach to welcome her. But Jill felt so used upwith her own share of the excitement that she was glad to becarried to the house by Frank and Jack, and laid upon her bed,where Mrs. Hammond soon restored her with sugar-coated pills,and words even sweeter and more soothing.</p> 
<p>　　Other people, busied with their own pleasures, forgot all about itby the next day; but Jill remembered that hour long afterward, bothawake and asleep, for her dreams were troubled, and she oftenstarted up imploring someone to save her. Then she would recallthe moment when, feeling most helpless, she had asked for help,and it had come as quickly as if that tearful little cry had beenheard and answered, though her voice had been drowned by thedash of the waves that seemed ready to devour her. This madea deep impression on her, and a sense of childlike faith in theFather of all began to grow up within her; for in that lonelyvoyage, short as it was, she had found a very precious treasure tokeep for ever, to lean on, and to love during the longer voyagewhich all must take before we reach our home.</p>
