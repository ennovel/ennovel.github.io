Not an easy penance, by any means,for the board was very hard, and she could do nothing while shelay there, as it did not slope enough to permit her to read withoutgreat fatigue of both eyes and hands. So the little martyr spent herfirst hour of trial in sobbing, the second in singing, for just as hermother and Mrs. Minot were deciding in despair that neither shenor they could bear it, Jill suddenly broke out into a merry chorusshe used to hear her father sing:</p> 
<p>　　"Faut jouer le mirliton,Faut jouer le mirlitir,Faut jouer le mirliter,Mir--li--ton."The sound of the brave little voice was very comforting to the twomothers hovering about her, and Jack said, with a look of mingledpity and admiration, as he brandished his crutch over theimaginary foes,"That's right! Sing away, and we'll play you are an Indian captivebeing tormented by your enemies, and too proud to complain. I'llwatch the clock, and the minute time is up I'll rush in and rescueyou."Jill laughed, but the fancy pleased her, and she straightened herselfout under the gay afghan, while she sang, in a plaintive voice,another little French song her father taught her:</p> 
<p>　　"J'avais une colombe blanche,J'avais un blanc petit pigeon,Tous deu~ volaient, do branche en branche,Jusqu'au falte de mon don geon:</p> 
<p>　　Mais comme un coup do vent d'automne,S'est abattu Za, I'éper-vier,Ft ma colombe si mignonneNe revient plus au colombier.""My poor Jean had a fine voice, and always hoped the child wouldtake after him. It would break his heart to see her lying there tryingto cheer her pain with the songs he used to sing her to sleep with,"said Mrs. Pecq, sadly.</p> 
<p>　　"She really has a great deal of talent, and when she is able sheshall have some lessons, for music is a comfort and a pleasure,sick or well," answered Mrs. Minot, who had often admired thefresh voice, with its pretty accent.</p> 
<p>　　Here Jill began the Canadian boat-song, with great vigor, as ifbound to play her part of Indian victim with spirit, and not disgraceherself by any more crying. All knew the air, and joined in,especially Jack, who came out strong on the "Row, brothers, row,"but ended in a squeak on a high note, so drolly, that the rest brokedown. So the hour that began with tears ended with music andlaughter, and a new pleasure to think of for the future.</p> 
<p>　　After that day Jill exerted all her fortitude, for she liked to have theboys call her brave and admire the cheerful way in which sheendured two hours of discomfort. She found she could use herzither as it lay upon her breast, and every day the pretty musicbegan at a certain hour, and all in the house soon learned to loveand listen for it. Even the old cook set open her kitchen door,saying pitifully, "Poor darlint, hear how purty she's singin', wid thepain, on that crewel boord. It's a little saint, she is. May her bedabove be aisy!"Frank would lift her gently on and off, with a kind word thatcomforted her immensely, and gentle Ed would come and teachher new bits of music, while the other fellows were frolickingbelow. Ralph added his share to her amusement, for he asked leaveto model her head in clay, and set up his work in a corner, Corningto pat, scrape, and mould whenever he had a spare minute,amusing her by his lively chat, and showing her how to shapebirds, rabbits, and queer faces in the soft clay, when the songswere all sung and her fingers tired of the zither.</p> 
<p>　　The girls sympathized very heartily with her new trial, and broughtall manner of gifts to cheer her captivity. Merry and Molly made agay screen by pasting pictures on the black cambric which coveredthe folding frame that stood before her to keep the draughts fromher as she lay on her board. Bright birds and flowers, figures andanimals, covered one side, and on the other they put mottoes, bitsof poetry, anecdotes, and short stories, so that Jill could lie andlook or read without the trouble of holding a book. It was not alldone at once, but grew slowly, and was a source of instruction aswell as amusement to them all, as they read carefully, that theymight make good Selections.</p> 
<p>　　But the thing that pleased Jill most was something Jack did, for hegave up going to school, and stayed at home nearly a fortnightafter he might have gone, all for her sake. The day the doctor saidhe might try it if he would be very careful, he was in great spirits,and limped about, looking up his books, and planning how hewould astonish his mates by the rapidity of his recovery. When hesat down to rest he remembered Jill, who had been lying quietlybehind the screen, while he talked with his mother, busy puttingfresh covers on the books.</p> 
<p>　　"She is so still, I guess she is asleep," thought Jack, peeping roundthe corner.</p> 
<p>　　No, not asleep, but lying with her eyes fixed on the sunny window,beyond which the bright winter world sparkled after a freshsnow-fall. The jingle of sleigh-bells could be heard, the laughter ofboys and girls on their way to school, all the pleasant stir of a newday of happy work and play for the rest of the world, more lonely,quiet, and wearisome than ever to her since her friend andfellow-prisoner was set free and going to leave her.</p> 
<p>　　Jack understood that patient, wistful look, and, without a word,went back to his seat, staring at the fire so soberly, that his motherpresently asked: "What are you thinking of so busily, with thatpucker in your forehead?""I've about made up my mind that I won't go to school just yet,"answered Jack, slowly lifting his head, for it cost him something togive up the long-expected pleasure.</p> 
<p>　　"Why not?" and Mrs. Minot looked much surprised, till Jackpointed to the screen, and, making a sad face to express Jill'sanguish, answered in a cheerful tone, 'Well, I'm not sure that it isbest. Doctor did not want me to go, but said I might because Iteased. I shall be sure to come to grief, and then everyone will say,'I told you so,' and that is so provoking. I'd rather keep still a weeklonger. Hadn't I better?"His mother smiled and nodded as she said, sewing away atmuch-abused old Caesar, as if she loved him, "Do as you thinkbest, dear. I always want you at home, but I don't wonder you arerather tired of it after this long confinement.""I say, Jill, should I be in your way if I didn't go to school till thefirst of February?" called Jack, laughing to himself at the absurdityof the question.</p> 
<p>　　"Not much!" answered a glad voice from behind the screen, and heknew the sorrowful eyes were shining with delight, though hecould not see them.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, I guess I may as well, and get quite firm on my legs before Istart. Another week or so will bring me up if I study hard, so I shallnot lose my time. I'll tackle my Latin as soon as it's ready, mother."Jack got a hearty kiss with the neatly covered book, and Mammaloved him for the little sacrifice more than if he had won a prize atschool. He did get a reward, for, in five minutes from the time hedecided, Jill was singing like a bobolink, and such a medley ofmerry music came from behind the screen, that it was a regularmorning concert. She did not know then that he stayed for hersake, but she found it out soon after, and when the time came didas much for him, as we shall see.</p> 
<p>　　It proved a wise decision, for the last part of January was sostormy Jack could not have gone half the time. So, while the snowdrifted, and bitter winds raged, he sat snugly at home amusing Jill,and getting on bravely with his lessons, for Frank took great painswith him to show his approbation of the little kindness, and,somehow, the memory of it seemed to make even the detestedLatin easier.</p> 
<p>　　With February fair weather set in, and Jack marched happily awayto school, with Jill's new mittens on his hands, Mamma noddingfrom the door-step, and Frank ready to give him a lift on the newsled, if the way proved too long or too rough.</p> 
<p>　　"I shall not have time to miss him now, for we are to be very busygetting ready for the Twenty-second. The Dramatic Club meetsto-night, and would like to come here, if they may, so 1 can help?"said Jill, as Mrs. Minot came up, expecting to find her rather lowin her mind.</p> 
<p>　　"Certainly; and I have a basket of old finery I looked up for theclub when I was rummaging out bits of silk for your blue quilt,"answered the good lady, who had set up a new employment tobeguile the hours of Jack's absence.</p> 
<p>　　When the girls arrived, that evening, they found Mrs. Chairwomansurrounded by a strew of theatrical properties, enjoying herselfvery much. All brought such contributions as they could muster,and all were eager about a certain tableau which was to be the gemof the whole, they thought. Jill, of course, was not expected to takeany part, but her taste was good, so all consulted her as theyshowed their old silks, laces, and flowers, asking who should bethis, and who that. All wanted to be the "Sleeping Beauty," for thatwas the chosen scene, with the slumbering court about theprincess, and the prince in the act of awakening her. Jack was to bethe hero, brave in his mother's velvet cape, red boots, and a realsword, while the other boys were to have parts of more or lesssplendor.</p> 
<p>　　"Mabel should be the Beauty, because her hair is so lovely," saidJuliet, who was quite satisfied with her own part of the Queen.</p> 
<p>　　"No, Merry ought to have it, as she is the prettiest, and has thatsplendid veil to wear," answered Molly, who was to be the maid ofhonor, cuffing the little page, Boo.</p> 
<p>　　"I don't care a bit, but my feather would be fine for the Princess,and I don't know as Emma would like to have me lend it to anyoneelse," said Annette, waving a long white plume over her head, withgirlish delight in its grace.</p> 
<p>　　"I should think the white silk dress, the veil, and the feather oughtto go together, with the scarlet crape shawl and these pearls. Thatwould be sweet, and just what princesses really wear," advised Jill,who was stringing a quantity of old Roman pearls.</p> 
<p>　　"We all want to wear the nice things, so let us draw lots. Wouldn'tthat be the fairest way?" asked Merry, looking like a rosy littlebride, under a great piece of illusion, which had done duty in manyplays.</p> 
<p>　　"The Prince is light, so the Princess must be darkish. We ought tochoose the girl who will look best, as it is a picture. I heard MissDelano say so, when the ladies got up the tableaux, last winter, andeveryone wanted to be Cleopatra," said Jill decidedly.</p> 
<p>　　"You choose, and then if we can't agree we will draw lots,"proposed Susy, who, being plain, knew there was little hope of hergetting a chance in any other way.</p> 
<p>　　So all stood in a row, and Jill, from her sofa, surveyed themcritically, feeling that the one Jack would really prefer was notamong the number.</p> 
<p>　　"I choose that one, for Juliet wants to be Queen, Molly wouldmake faces, and the others are too big or too light," pronouncedJill, pointing to Merry, who looked pleased, while Mabel's facedarkened, and Susy gave a disdainful sniff.</p> 
<p>　　"You'd better draw lots, and then there will be no fuss. Ju and I areout of the fight, but you three can try, and let this settle thematter," said Molly, handing Jill a long strip of paper.</p> 
<p>　　All agreed to let it be so, and when the bits were ready drew inturn. This time fate was evidently on Merry's side, and no onegrumbled when she showed the longest paper.</p> 
<p>　　"Go and dress, then come back, and we'll plan how we are to beplaced before we call up the boys," commanded Jill, who wasmanager, since she could be nothing else.</p> 
<p>　　The girls retired to the bedroom and began to "rig up," as theycalled it; but discontent still lurked among them, and showed itselfin sharp words, envious looks, and disobliging acts.</p> 
<p>　　"Am I to have the white silk and the feather?" asked Merry,delighted with the silvery shimmer of the one and the gracefuldroop of the other, though both were rather shabby.</p> 
<p>　　"You can use your own dress. I don't see why you should haveeverything," answered Susy, who was at the mirror, putting awreath of scarlet flowers on her red head, bound to be gay sinceshe could not be pretty.</p> 
<p>　　"I think I'd better keep the plume, as I haven't anything else that isnice, and I'm afraid Emma wouldn't like me to lend it," addedAnnette, who was disappointed that Mabel was not to be theBeauty.</p> 
<p>　　"1 don't intend to act at all!" declared Mabel, beginning to braid upher hair with a jerk, out of humor with the whole affair.</p> 
<p>　　"1 think you are a set of cross, selfish girls to back out and keepyour nice things just because you can't all have the best part. I'mashamed of you!" scolded Molly, standing by Merry, who wassadly surveying her mother's old purple silk, which looked likebrown in the evening.</p> 
<p>　　"I'm going to have Miss Delano's red brocade for the Queen, and Ishall ask her for the yellow-satin dress for Merry when I go to getmine, and tell her how mean you are," said Juliet, frowning underher gilt-paper crown as she swept about in a red table-S cloth fortrain till the brocade arrived.</p> 
<p>　　"Perhaps you'd like to have Mabel cut her hair off, so Merry canhave that, too?" cried Susy, with whom hair was a tender point.</p> 
<p>　　"Light hair isn't wanted, so Ju will have to give hers, or you'd betterborrow Miss Bat's frisette," added Mabel, with a scornful laugh.</p> 
<p>　　"I just wish Miss Bat was here to give you girls a good shaking. Dolet someone else have a chance at the glass, you peacock!"exclaimed Molly Loo, pushing Susy aside to arrange her own blueturban, out of which she plucked the pink pompon to give Merry.</p> 
<p>　　"Don't quarrel about me. I shall do well enough, and the scarletshawl will hide my ugly dress," said Merry, from the corner, whereshe sat waiting for her turn at the mirror.</p> 
<p>　　As she spoke of the shawl her eye went in search of it, andsomething that she saw in the other room put her owndisappointment out of her head. Jill lay there all alone, rather tiredwith the lively chatter, and the effort it cost her not to repine atbeing shut out from the great delight of dressing up and acting.</p> 
<p>　　Her eyes were closed, her net was off, and all the pretty black curlslay about her shoulders as one hand idly pulled them out, while theother rested on the red shawl, as if she loved its glowing color andsoft texture. She was humming to herself the little song of the doveand the donjon, and something in the plaintive voice, the solitaryfigure, went straight to Merry's gentle heart.</p> 
<p>　　"Poor Jilly can't have any of the fun," was the first thought; thencame a second, that made Merry start and smile, and in a minutewhisper so that all but Jill could hear her, "Girls, I'm not going tobe the Princess. But I've thought of a splendid one!"'Who?" asked the rest, staring at one another, much surprised bythis sudden announcement.</p> 
<p>　　"Hush! Speak low, or you will spoil it all. Look in the Bird Room,and tell me if that isn't a prettier Princess than I could make?"They all looked, but no one spoke, and Merry added, with sweeteagerness, "It is the only thing poor Jill can be, and it would makeher so happy; Jack would like it, and it would please everyone, Iknow. Perhaps she will never walk again, so we ought to be verygood to her, poor dear."The last words, whispered with a little quiver in the voice, settledthe matter better than hours of talking, for girls are tenderheartedcreatures, and not one of these but would have gladly given all thepretty things she owned to see Jill dancing about well and strongagain. Like a ray of sunshine the kind thought touched andbrightened every face; envy, impatience, vanity, and discontentflew away like imps at the coming of the good fairy, and with oneaccord they all cried,"It will be lovely; let us go and tell her!"Forgetting their own adornment, out they trooped after Merry, whoran to the sofa, saying, with a smile which was reflected in all theother faces, "Jill, dear, we have chosen another Princess, and Iknow you'll like her.""Who is it?" asked Jill, languidly, opening her eyes without theleast suspicion of the truth.</p> 
<p>　　"I'll show you"; and taking the cherished veil from her own head,Merry dropped it like a soft cloud over Jill; Annette added the longplume, Susy laid the white silk dress about her, while Juliet andMabel lifted the scarlet shawl to spread it over the foot of the sofa,and Molly tore the last ornament from her turban, a silver star, toshine on Jill's breast. Then they all took hands and danced roundthe couch, singing, as they laughed at her astonishment, "There sheis! There she is! Princess Jill as fine as you please!</p> 
<p>　　"Do you really mean it? But can I? Is it fair? How sweet of you!</p> 
<p>　　Come here and let me hug you all!" cried Jill, in a rapture at thesurprise, and the pretty way in which it was done.</p> 
<p>　　The grand scene on the Twenty-second was very fine, indeed; butthe little tableau of that minute was infinitely better, though no onesaw it, as Jill tried to gather them all in her arms, for that nosegayof girlish faces was the sweeter, because each one bad sacrificedher own little vanity to please a friend, and her joy was reflected inthe eyes that sparkled round the happy Princess.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, you dear, kind things, to think of me and give me all yourbest clothes! I never shall forget it, and I'll do anything for you.</p> 
<p>　　Yes! I'll write and ask Mrs. Piper to lend us her ermine cloak forthe king. See if I don't!"Shrieks of delight hailed this noble offer, for no one had dared toborrow the much-coveted mantle, but all agreed that the old ladywould not refuse Jill. It was astonishing how smoothly everythingwent after this, for each was eager to help, admire, and suggest, inthe friendliest way; and when all were dressed, the boys found aparty of very gay ladies waiting for them round the couch, wherelay the brightest little Princess ever seen.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, Jack, I'm to act! Wasn't it dear of the girls to choose me?</p> 
<p>　　Don't they look lovely? Aren't you glad?" cried Jill, as the ladsstared and the lasses blushed and smiled, well pleased at the frankadmiration the boyish faces showed.</p> 
<p>　　"I guess I am! You are a set of trumps, and we'll give you afirst-class spread after the play to pay for it. Won't we, fellows?"answered Jack, much gratified, and feeling that now he could acthis own part capitally.</p> 
<p>　　"We will. It was a handsome thing to do, and we think well of youfor it. Hey, Gus?" and Frank nodded approvingly at all, though helooked only at Annette.</p> 
<p>　　"As king of this crowd, I call it to order," said Gus, retiring to thethrone, where Juliet sat laughing in her red table-cloth.</p> 
<p>　　"We'll have 'The Fair One with Golden Locks' next time; I promiseyou that," whispered Ed to Mabel, whose shining hair streamedover her blue dress like a mantle of gold-colored silk.</p> 
<p>　　"Girls are pretty nice things, aren't they? Kind of 'em to take Jill in.</p> 
<p>　　Don't Molly look fine, though?" and Grif's black eyes twinkled ashe planned to pin her skirts to Merry's at the first opportunity.</p> 
<p>　　"Susy looks as gay as a feather-duster. I like her. She never snubs afellow," said Joe, much impressed with the splendor of the courtladies.</p> 
<p>　　The boys' costumes were not yet ready, but they posed well, and allhad a merry time, ending with a game of blind-man's-buff, inwhich everyone caught the right person in the most singular way,and all agreed as they went home in the moonlight that it had beenan ususually jolly meeting.</p> 
<p>　　So the fairy play woke the sleeping beauty that lies in all of us, andmakes us lovely when we rouse it with a kiss of unselfishgood-will, for, though the girls did not know it then, they hadadorned themselves with pearls more precious than the waxenones they'd ecked their Princess in.</p>
