She had taught them to behave well at meals, so, thoughtheir eyes glared and their tails quivered with impatience, theyobeyed; and when she put the food on a high shelf and retired tothe big basket, the four old cats sat demurely down before her,while the five kits scrambled after her and tumbled into her lap, asif hoping to hasten the desired feast by their innocent gambols.</p> 
<p>　　Granny, Tobias, Mortification, and Molasses were the elders.</p> 
<p>　　Granny, a gray old puss, was the mother and grandmother of all therest. Tobias was her eldest son, and Mortification his brother, sonamed because he had lost his tail, which affliction depressed hisspirits and cast a blight over his young life. Molasses was a yellowcat, the mamma of four of the kits, the fifth being Granny's latestdarling. Toddlekins, the little aunt, was the image of her mother,and very sedate even at that early age; Miss Muffet, so called fromher dread of spiders, was a timid black and white kit; Beauty, apretty Maltese, with a serene little face and pink nose; Ragbag, afunny thing, every color that a cat could be; and Scamp, who welldeserved his name, for he was the plague of Miss Bat's life, andMolly's especial pet.</p> 
<p>　　He was now perched on her shoulder, and, as she talked, keptpeeping into her face or biting her ear in the most impertinent way,while the others sprawled in her lap or promenaded round thebasket rim.</p> 
<p>　　"My friends, something very remarkable has happened: Miss Bat iscleaning house!" and, having made this announcement, Mollyleaned back to see how the cats received it, for she insisted thatthey understood all she said to them.</p> 
<p>　　Tobias stared, Mortification lay down as if it was too much forhim, Molasses beat her tail on the floor as if whipping a dustycarpet, and Granny began to purr approvingly. The giddy kits paidno attention, as they did not know what house-cleaning meant,happy little dears!</p> 
<p>　　"I thought you'd like it, Granny, for you are a decent cat, and knowwhat is proper," continued Molly, leaning down to stroke the oldpuss, who blinked affectionately at her. "I can't imagine what put itinto Miss Bat's head. I never said a word, and gave up groaningover the clutter, as I couldn't mend it. I just took care of Boo andmyself, and left her to be as untidy as she pleased, and she is aregular old----"Here Scamp put his paw on her lips because he saw them moving,but it seemed as if it was to check the disrespectful word justcoming out.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, I won't call names; but what shall I do when I seeeverything in confusion, and she won't let me clear up?" askedMolly, looking round at Scamp, who promptly put the little paw onher eyelid, as if the roll of the blue ball underneath amused him.</p> 
<p>　　"Shut my eyes to it, you mean? I do all I can, but it is hard, when Iwish to be nice, and do try; don't I?" asked Molly. But Scamp wasready for her, and began to comb her hair with both paws as hestood on his hind legs to work so busily that Molly laughed andpulled him down, saying, as she cuddled the sly kit.</p> 
<p>　　"You sharp little thing! I know my hair is not neat now, for I'vebeen chasing Boo round the garden to wash him for school. ThenMiss Bat threw the parlor carpet out of the window, and I was sosurprised I had to run and tell you. Now, what had we better doabout it?"The cats all winked at her, but no one had any advice to offer,except Tobias, who walked to the shelf, and, looking up, uttered adeep, suggestive yowl, which said as plainly as words, "Dinnerfirst and discussion afterward.""Very well, don't scramble," said Molly, getting up to feed herpets. First the kits, who rushed at the bowl and thrust their headsin, lapping as if for a wager; then the cats, who each went to one ofthe four piles of scraps laid round at intervals and placidly ate theirmeat; while Molly retired to the basket, to ponder over thephenomena taking place in the house.</p> 
<p>　　She could not imagine what had started the old lady. It was not theexample of her neighbors, who had beaten carpets and scrubbedpaint every spring for years without exciting her to any greaterexertion than cleaning a few windows and having a man to clearaway the rubbish displayed when the snow melted. Molly neverguessed that her own efforts were at the bottom of the change, orknew that a few words not meant for her ear had shamed Miss Batinto action. Coming home from prayer-meeting one dark night, shetrotted along behind two old ladies who were gossiping in loudvoices, as one was rather deaf, and Miss Bat was both pleased andtroubled to hear herself unduly praised.</p> 
<p>　　"I always said Sister Dawes meant well; but she's getting intoyears, and the care of two children is a good deal for her, with hercooking and her rheumatiz. I don't deny she did neglect 'em for aspell, but she does well by 'em now, and I wouldn't wish to seebetter-appearing children.""You've no idee how improved Molly is. She came in to see mygirls, and brought her sewing-work, shirts for the boy, and done itas neat and capable as you'd wish to see. She always was a smartchild, but dreadful careless," said the other old lady, evidentlymuch impressed by the change in harum-scarum Molly Loo.</p> 
<p>　　"Being over to Mis Minot's so much has been good for her, and upto Mis Grant's. Girls catch neat ways as quick as they'd o untidyones, and them wild little tykes often turn out smart women.""Sister Dawes has done well by them children, and I hope Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Bemis sees it. He ought to give her something comfortable to liveon when she can't do for him any longer. He can well afford it.""I haven't a doubt he will. He's a lavish man when he starts to do athing, but dreadful unobserving, else he'd have seen to matters longago. Them children was town-talk last fall, and I used to feel as ifit was my bounden duty to speak to Miss Dawes. But I never did,fearing I might speak too plain, and hurt her feelings.""You've spoken plain enough now, and I'm beholden to you,though you'll never know it," said Miss Bat to herself, as sheslipped into her own gate, while the gossips trudged on quiteunconscious of the listener behind them.</p> 
<p>　　Miss Bat was a worthy old soul in the main, only, like so many ofus, she needed rousing up to her duty. She had got the rousingnow, and it did her good, for she could not bear to be praised whenshe had not deserved it. She had watched Molly's efforts with lazyinterest, and when the girl gave up meddling with her affairs, asshe called the housekeeping, Miss Bat ceased to oppose her, andlet her scrub Boo, mend clothes, and brush her hair as much as sheliked. So Molly had worked along without any help from her,running in to Mrs. Pecq for advice, to Merry for comfort, or Mrs.</p> 
<p>　　Minot for the higher kind of help one often needs so much. NowMiss Bat found that she was getting the credit and the praisebelonging to other people, and it stirred her up to try and deserve apart at least.</p> 
<p>　　"Molly don't want any help about her work or the boy: it's too latefor that; but if this house don't get a spring cleaning that will makeit shine, my name ain't Bathsheba Dawes," said the old lady, as sheput away her bonnet that night, and laid energetic plans for a grandrevolution, inspired thereto not only by shame, but by the hint that"Mr. Bemis was a lavish man," as no one knew better than she.</p> 
<p>　　Molly's amazement next day at seeing carpets fly out of window,ancient cobwebs come down, and long-undisturbed closets routedout to the great dismay of moths and mice, has been alreadyconfided to the cats, and as she sat there watching them lap andgnaw, she said to herself,"I don't understand it, but as she never says much to me about myaffairs, I won't take any notice till she gets through, then I'll admireeverything all I can. It is so pleasant to be praised after you've beentrying hard."She might well say that, for she got very little herself, and hertrials had been many, her efforts not always successful, and herreward seemed a long way off. Poor Boo could have sympathizedwith her, for he had suffered much persecution from his smallschoolmates when he appeared with large gray patches on the littlebrown trousers, where he had worn them out coasting down thosetoo fascinating steps. As he could not see the patches himself, hefancied them invisible, and came home much afflicted by the jeersof his friends. Then Molly tried to make him a new pair out of asack of her own; but she cut both sides for the same leg, so onewas wrong side out. Fondly hoping no one would observe it, shesewed bright buttons wherever they could be put, and sentconfiding Boo away in a pair of blue trousers, which were absurdlyhunchy behind and buttony before. He came home heart-brokenand muddy, having been accidentally tipped into a mud-puddle bytwo bad boys who felt that such tailoring was an insult to mankind.</p> 
<p>　　That roused Molly's spirit, and she begged her father to take theboy and have him properly fitted out, as he was old enough now tobe well-dressed, and she wouldn't have him tormented. Hisattention being called to the trousers, Mr. Bemis had a good laughover them, and then got Boo a suit which caused him to be theadmired of all observers, and to feel as proud as a little peacock.</p> 
<p>　　Cheered by this success, Molly undertook a set of small shirts, andstitched away bravely, though her own summer clothes were in asad state, and for the first time in her life she cared about what sheshould wear.</p> 
<p>　　"I must ask Merry, and maybe father will let me go with her andher mother when they do their shopping, instead of leaving it toMiss Bat, who dresses me like an old woman. Merry knows whatis pretty and becoming: I don't," thought Molly, meditating in thebushel basket, with her eyes on her snuff-colored gown and thedark purple bow at the end of the long braid Muffet had beenplaying with.</p> 
<p>　　Molly was beginning to see that even so small a matter as thechoice of colors made a difference in one's appearance, and towonder why Merry always took such pains to have a blue tie forthe gray dress, a rosy one for the brown, and gloves that matchedher bonnet ribbons. Merry never wore a locket outside her sack, agay bow in her hair and soiled cuffs, a smart hat and the braidworn off her skirts. She was exquisitely neat and simple, yetalways looked well-dressed and pretty; for her love of beautytaught her what all girls should learn as soon as they begin to carefor appearances--that neatness and simplicity are their bestornaments, that good habits are better than fine clothes, and themost elegant manners are the kindest.</p> 
<p>　　All these thoughts were dancing through Molly's head, and whenshe left her cats, after a general romp in which even decorousGranny allowed her family to play leap-frog over her respectableback, she had made up her mind not to have yellow ribbons on hersummer hat if she got a pink muslin as she had planned, but tofinish off Boo's last shirt before she went shopping with Merry.</p> 
<p>　　It rained that evening, and Mr. Bemis had a headache, so he threwhimself down upon the lounge after tea for a nap, with his silkhandkerchief spread over his face. He did get a nap, and when hewaked he lay for a time drowsily listening to the patter of the rain,and another sound which was even more soothing. Putting back acorner of the handkerchief to learn what it was, he saw Mollysitting by the fire with Boo in her lap, rocking and humming as shewarmed his little bare feet, having learned to guard against croupby attending to the damp shoes and socks before going to bed. Boolay with his round face turned up to hers, stroking her cheek whilethe sleepy blue eyes blinked lovingly at her as she sang her lullabywith a motherly patience sweet to see. They made a pretty littlepicture, and Mr. Bemis looked at it with pleasure, having a leisuremoment in which to discover, as all parents do sooner or later, thathis children were growing up.</p> 
<p>　　"Molly is getting to be quite a woman, and very like her mother,"thought papa, wiping the eye that peeped, for he had been fond ofthe pretty wife who died when Boo was born. "Sad loss to them,poor things! But Miss Bat seems to have done well by them. Mollyis much improved, and the boy looks finely. She's a good soul,after all"; and Mr. Bemis began to think he had been hasty whenhe half made up his mind to get a new housekeeper, feeling thatburnt steak, weak coffee, and ragged wristbands were sure signsthat Miss Bat's days of usefulness were over.</p> 
<p>　　Molly was singing the lullaby her mother used to sing to her, andher father listened to it silently till Boo was carried away toosleepy for anything but bed. When she came back she sat down toher work, fancying her father still asleep. She had a crimson bowat her throat and one on the newly braided hair, her cuffs wereclean, and a white apron hid the shabbiness of the old dress. Shelooked like a thrifty little housewife as she sat with her basketbeside her full of neat white rolls, her spools set forth, and a newpair of scissors shining on the table. There was a sort of charm inwatching the busy needle flash to and fro, the anxious pucker ofthe forehead as she looked to see if the stitches were even, and theexpression of intense relief upon her face as she surveyed thefinished button-hole with girlish satisfaction. Her father was wideawake and looking at her, thinking, as he did so,"Really the old lady has worked well to change my tomboy intothat nice little girl: I wonder how she did it." Then he gave a yawn,pulled off the handkerchief, and said aloud, 'What are you making,Molly?" for it struck him that sewing was a new amusement.</p> 
<p>　　"Shirts for Boo, sir. Four, and this is the last," she answered, withpardonable pride, as she held it up and nodded toward the pile inher basket.</p> 
<p>　　"Isn't that a new notion? I thought Miss Bat did the sewing," saidMr. Bemis, as he smiled at the funny little garment, it looked solike Boo himself.</p> 
<p>　　"No, sir; only yours. I do mine and Boo's. At least, I'm learninghow, and Mrs. Pecq says I get on nicely," answered Molly,threading her needle and making a knot in her most capable way.</p> 
<p>　　"I suppose it is time you did learn, for you are getting to be a greatgirl, and all women should know how to make and mend. Youmust take a stitch for me now and then: Miss Bat's eyes are notwhat they were, I find"; and Mr. Bemis looked at his frayedwristband, as if he particularly felt the need of a stitch just then.</p> 
<p>　　"I'd love to, and I guess I could. I can mend gloves; Merry taughtme, so I'd better begin on them, if you have any," said Molly, muchpleased at being able to do anything for her father, and still moreso at being asked.</p> 
<p>　　"There's something to start with"; and he threw her a pair, withnearly every finger ripped.</p> 
<p>　　Molly shook her head over them, but got out her gray silk and fellto work, glad to show how well she could sew.</p> 
<p>　　"What are you smiling about?" asked her father, after a little pause,for his head felt better, and it amused him to question Molly.</p> 
<p>　　"I was thinking about my summer clothes. I must get them beforelong, and I'd like to go with Mrs. Grant and learn how to shop, ifyou are willing."I thought Miss Bat did that for you.</p> 
<p>　　"She always has, but she gets ugly, cheap things that I don't like. Ithink I am old enough to choose myself, if there is someone to tellme about prices and the goodness of the stuff. Merry does; and sheis only a few months older than I am.""How old are you, child?" asked her father, feeling as if he had losthis reckoning.</p> 
<p>　　"Fifteen in August"; and Molly looked very proud of the fact.</p> 
<p>　　"So you are! Bless my heart, how the time goes! Well, get whatyou please; if I'm to have a young lady here, I'd like to have herprettily dressed. It won't offend Miss Bat, will it?"Molly's eyes sparkled, but she gave a little shrug as she answered,"She won't care. She never troubles herself about me if I iet ncralone.</p> 
<p>　　"Hey? what? Not trouble herself? If she doesn't, who does?" andMr. Bemis sat up as if this discovery was more surprising than theother.</p> 
<p>　　"I take care of myself and Boo, and she looks after you. The housegoes anyway.""I should think so! I nearly broke my neck over the parlor sofa inthe hall to-night. What is it there for?"Molly laughed. "That's the joke, sir, Miss Bat is cleaning house,and I'm sure it needs cleaning, for it is years since it was properlydone. I thought you might have told her to.""I've said nothing. Don't like house-cleaning well enough tosuggest it. I did think the hall was rather dirty when I dropped mycoat and took it up covered with lint. Is she going to upset thewhole place?" asked Mr. Bemis, looking alarmed at the prospect.</p> 
<p>　　"I hope so, for I really am ashamed when people come, to havethem see the dust and cobwebs, and old carpets and dirtywindows," said Molly, with a sigh, though she never had cared abit till lately.</p> 
<p>　　"Why don't you dust round a little, then? No time to spare from thebooks and play?""I tried, father, but Miss Bat didn't like it, and it was too hard forme alone. If things were once in nice order, I think I could keepthem so; for I do want to be neat, and I'm learning as fast as I can.""It is high time someone took hold, if matters are left as you say.</p> 
<p>　　I've just been thinking what a clever woman Miss Bat was, to makesuch a tidy little girl out of what I used to hear called the greatesttomboy in town, and wondering what I could give the old lady.</p> 
<p>　　Now I find you are the one to be thanked, and it is a very pleasantsurprise to me.""Give her the present, please; I'm satisfied, if you like what I'vedone. It isn't much, and I'd idn't know as you would ever observeany difference. But I'd id try, and now I guess I'm really gettingon," said Molly, sewing away with a bright color in her cheeks, forshe, too, found it a pleasant surprise to be praised after manyfailures and few successes.</p> 
<p>　　"You certainly are, my dear. I'll wait till the house-cleaning is over,and then, if we are all alive, I'll see about Miss Bat's reward.</p> 
<p>　　Meantime, you go with Mrs. Grant and get whatever you and theboy need, and send the bills to me"; and Mr. Bemis lighted a cigar,as if that matter was settled.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, thank you, sir! That will be splendid. Merry always has prettythings, and I know you will like me when I get fixed," said Molly,smoothing down her apron, with a little air.</p> 
<p>　　"Seems to me you look very well as you are. Isn't that a prettyenough frock?" asked Mr. Bemis, quite unconscious that his ownunusual interest in his daughter's affairs made her look so brightand winsome.</p> 
<p>　　"This? Why, father, I've worn it all winter, and it's frightfully ugly,and almost in rags. I asked you for a new one a month ago, and yousaid you'd 'see about it'; but you didn't, so I patched this up as wellas I could"; and Molly showed her elbows, feeling that suchmasculine blindness as this deserved a mild reproof.</p> 
<p>　　"Too bad! Well, go and get half a dozen pretty muslin andgingham things, and be as gay as a butterfly, to make up for it,"laughed her father, really touched by the patches and Molly'sresignation to the unreliable "I'll see about it," which he recognizedas a household word.</p> 
<p>　　Molly clapped her hands, old gloves and all, exclaiming, withgirlish delight, "How nice it will seem to have a plenty of new,neat dresses all at once, and be like other girls! Miss Bat alwaystalks about economy, and has no more taste than a--caterpillar."Molly meant to say "cat," but remembering her pets, spared themthe insult.</p> 
<p>　　"I think I can afford to dress my girl as well as Grant does his. Geta new hat and coat, child, and any little notions you fancy. MissBat's economy isn't the sort I like"; and Mr. Bemis looked at hiswristbands again, as if he could sympathize with Molly's elbows.</p> 
<p>　　"At this rate, I shall have more clothes than I know what to dowith, after being a rag-bag," thought the girl, in great glee, as shebravely stitched away at the worst glove, while her father smokedsilently for a while, feeling that several little matters had escapedhis eye which he really ought to "see about."Presently he went to his desk, but not to bury himself in businesspapers, as usual, for, after rummaging in several drawers, he tookout a small bunch of keys, and sat looking at them with anexpression only seen on his face when he looked up at the portraitof a dark-eyed woman hanging in his room. He was a very busyman, but he had a tender place in his heart for his children; andwhen a look, a few words, a moment's reflection, called hisattention to the fact that his little girl was growing up, he foundboth pride and pleasure in the thought that this young daughter wastrying to fill her mother's place, and be a comfort to him, if hewould let her.</p> 
<p>　　"Molly, my dear, here is something for you," he said; and when shestood beside him, added, as he put the keys into her hand, keepingboth in his own for a minute,"Those are the keys to your mother's things. I always meant you tohave them, when you were old enough to use or care for them. Ithink you'ii fancy this better than any other present, for you are agood child, and very like her."Something seemed to get into his throat there, and Molly put herarm round his neck, saying, with a little choke in her own voice,"Thank you, father, I'd rather have this than anything else in theworld, and I'll try to be more like her every day, for your sake.</p> 
<p>　　He kissed her, then said, as he began to stir his papers about, "Imust write some letters. Run off to bed, child. Good-night, mydear, good-night."Seeing that he wanted to be alone, Molly slipped away, feeling thatshe had received a very precious gift; for she remembered the dear,dead mother, and had often longed to possess the relics laid awayin the one room where order reigned and Miss Bat had no power tomeddle. As she siowly undressed, she was not thinking of thepretty new gowns in which she was to be "as gay as a butterfly,"but of the half-worn garments waiting for her hands to unfold witha tender touch; and when she fell asleep, with the keys under herpillow and her arms round Boo, a few happy tears on her cheeksseemed to show that, in trying to do the duty which lay nearest her,she had earned a very sweet reward.</p> 
<p>　　So the little missionaries succeeded better in their second attemptthan in their first; for, though still very far from being perfect girls,each was slowly learning, in her own way, one of the three lessonsall are the better for knowing--that cheerfulness can changemisfortune into love and friends; that in ordering one's self arightone helps others to do the same; and that the power of findingbeauty in the humblest things makes home happy and life lovely.</p>
