Bell's rung! Get up, lazy-bones!" called Frank from hisroom as the clock struck six one bright morning, and a greatcreaking and stamping proclaimed that he was astir.</p> 
<p>　　"All right, I'm coming," responded a drowsy voice, and Jack turnedover as if to obey; but there the effort ended, and he was off again,for growing lads are hard to rouse, as many a mother knows to hersorrow.</p> 
<p>　　Frank made a beginning on his own toilet, and then took a look athis brother, for the stillness was suspicious.</p> 
<p>　　"I thought so! He told me to wake him, and I guess this will do it";and, filling his great sponge with water, Frank stalked into the nextroom and stood over the unconscious victim like a sternexecutioner, glad to unite business with pleasure in this agreeablemanner.</p> 
<p>　　A woman would have relented and tried some milder means, forwhen his broad shoulders and stout limbs were hidden, Jacklooked very young and innocent in his sleep. Even Frank paused amoment to look at the round, rosy face, the curly eyelashes,half-open mouth, and the peaceful expression of a dreaming baby.</p> 
<p>　　"I must do it, or he won't be ready for breakfast," said the Spartanbrother, and down came the sponge, cold, wet, and choky, as itwas briskly rubbed to and fro regardless of every obstacle.</p> 
<p>　　"Come, I say! That's not fair! Leave me alone!" sputtered Jack,hitting out so vigorously that the sponge flew across the room, andFrank fell back to laugh at the indignant sufferer.</p> 
<p>　　"I promised to wake you, and you believe in keeping promises, soI'm doing my best to get you up.""Well, you needn't pour a quart of water down a fellow's neck, andrub his nose off, need you? I'm awake, so take your old sponge andgo along," growled Jack, with one eye open and a mighty gape.</p> 
<p>　　"See that you keep so, then, or I'll come and give you another sortof a rouser," said Frank, retiring well-pleased with his success.</p> 
<p>　　"I shall have one good stretch, if I like. It is strengthening to themuscles, and I'm as stiff as a board with all that footballyesterday," murmured Jack, lying down for one delicious moment.</p> 
<p>　　He shut the open eye to enjoy it thoroughly, and forgot the stretchaltogether, for the bed was warm, the pillow soft, and ahalf-finished dream still hung about his drowsy brain. Who doesnot know the fatal charm of that stolen moment--for once yield toit, and one is lost.</p> 
<p>　　Jack was miles away "in the twinkling of a bedpost," and thepleasing dream seemed about to return, when a ruthless hand toreoff the clothes, swept him out of bed, and he really did awake tofind himself standing in the middle of his bath-pan with bothwindows open, and Frank about to pour a pail of water over him.</p> 
<p>　　"Hold on! Yah, how cold the water is! Why, I thought I was up";and, hopping out, Jack rubbed his eyes and looked about with sucha genuine surprise that Frank put down the pail, feeling that thedeluge would not be needed this time.</p> 
<p>　　"You are now, and I'll see that you keep so," he said, as he strippedthe bed and carried off the pillows.</p> 
<p>　　"I don't care. What a jolly day!" and Jack took a little promenadeto finish the rousing process.</p> 
<p>　　"You'd better hurry up, or you won't get your chores done beforebreakfast. No time for a go as you please now, said Frank; andboth boys laughed, for it was an old joke of theirs, and ratherfunny.</p> 
<p>　　Going up to bed one night expecting to find Jack asleep, Frankdiscovered him tramping round and round the room airily attired ina towel, and so dizzy with his brisk revolutions that as his brotherlooked he tumbled over and lay panting like a fallen gladiator.</p> 
<p>　　"What on earth are you about?""Playing Rowell. Walking for the belt, and I've got it too," laughedJack, pointing to an old gilt chandelier chain hanging on thebedpost.</p> 
<p>　　"You little noodle, you'd better revolve into bed before you loseyour head entirely. I never saw such a fellow for taking himself offhis legs.""Well, if I didn't exercise, do you suppose I should be able to dothat--or that?" cried Jack, turning a somersault and striking a fineattitude as he came up, flattering himself that he was the model ofa youthful athlete.</p> 
<p>　　"You look more like a clothes-pin than a Hercules," was thecrushing reply of this unsympathetic brother, and Jack meeklyretired with a bad headache.</p> 
<p>　　"I don't do such silly things now: I'm as broad across the shouldersas you are, and twice as strong on my pins, thanks to mygymnastics. Bet you a cent I'll be dressed first, though you have gotthe start," said Jack, knowing that Frank always had a protractedwrestle with his collar-buttons, which gave his adversary a greatadvantage over him.</p> 
<p>　　"Done!" answered Frank, and at it they went. A wild scramble washeard in Jack's room, and a steady tramp in the other as Frankworked away at the stiff collar and the unaccommodating buttontill every finger ached. A clashing of boots followed, while Jackwhistled "Polly Hopkins," and Frank declaimed in his deepestvoice,"Arma virumque cano, Trojae qui primus ab oris Italiam, fatoprofugus, Laviniaque venit litora."Hair-brushes came next, and here Frank got ahead, for Jack's thickcrop would stand straight up on the crown, and only a goodwetting and a steady brush would make it lie down.</p> 
<p>　　"Play away, No. 2 called out frank as he put on his vest, whileJack was still at it with a pair of the stiffest brushes procurable formoney.</p> 
<p>　　"Hold hard, No. 11, and don't forget your teeth," answered Jack,who had done his.</p> 
<p>　　Frank took a hasty rub and whisked on his coat, while Jack waspicking up the various treasures which had flown out of hispockets as he caught up his roundabout.</p> 
<p>　　"Ready! I'll trouble you for a cent, sonny"; and Frank held out hishand as he appeared equipped for the day.</p> 
<p>　　"You haven't hung up your night-gown, nor aired the bed, noropened the windows. That's part of the dressing; mother said so.</p> 
<p>　　I've got you there, for you did all that for me, except this," and Jackthrew his gown over a chair with a triumphant flourish as Frankturned back to leave his room in the order which they had beentaught was one of the signs of a good bringing-up in boys as wellas girls.</p> 
<p>　　"Ready! I'll trouble you for a cent, old man"; and Jack held out hishand, with a chuckle.</p> 
<p>　　He got the money and a good clap beside; then they retired to theshed to black their boots, after which Frank filled the woodboxesand Jack split kindlings, till the daily allowance was ready. Bothwent at their lessons for half an hour, Jack scowling over hisalgebra in the sofa corner, while Frank, with his elbows on and hislegs round the little stand which held his books, seemed to behaving a wrestling-match with Herodotus.</p> 
<p>　　When the bell rang they were glad to drop the lessons and fallupon their breakfast with the appetite of wolves, especially Jack,who sequestered oatmeal and milk with such rapidity that onewould have thought he had a leathern bag hidden somewhere toslip it into, like his famous namesake when he breakfasted with thegiant.</p> 
<p>　　"I declare I don't see what he does with it! He really ought not to'gobble' so, mother," said Frank, who was eating with greatdeliberation and propriety.</p> 
<p>　　"Never you mind, old quiddle. I'm so hungry I could tuck away abushel," answered Jack, emptying a glass of milk and holding outhis plate for more mush, regardless of his white moustache.</p> 
<p>　　"Temperance in all things is wise, in speech as well as eating anddrinking--remember that, boys," said Mamma from behind the urn.</p> 
<p>　　"That reminds me! We promised to do the 'Observer' this week,and here it is Tuesday and I haven't done a thing: have you?" askedFrank.</p> 
<p>　　"Never thought of it. We must look up some bits at noon instead 0fplaying. Dare say Jill has got some: she always saves all she findsfor me.""I have one or two good items, and can do any copying there maybe. But I think if you undertake the paper you should give sometime and labor to make it good," said Mamma, who was used tothis state of affairs, and often edited the little sheet read everyweek at the Lodge. The boys seldom missed going, but the busylady was often unable to be there, so helped with the paper as hershare of the labor.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes, we ought, but somehow we don't seem to get up much steamabout it lately. If more people belonged, and we could have agrand time now and then, it would be jolly"; and Jack sighedat the lack of interest felt by outsiders in the loyal little Lodgewhich went on year after year kept up by the faithful few.</p> 
<p>　　"I remember when in this very town we used to have a Cold WaterArmy, and in the summer turn out with processions, banners, andbands of music to march about, and end with a picnic, songs, andspeeches in some grove or hall. Nearly all the children belonged toit, and the parents also, and we had fine times here twenty-five orthirty years ago.""It didn't do much good, seems to me, for people still drink, andwe haven't a decent hotel in the place," said Frank, as his mothersat looking out of the window as if she saw again the pleasant sightof old and young working together against the great enemy ofhome peace and safety.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh yes, it did, my dear; for to this day many of those children aretrue to their pledge. One little girl was, I am sure, and now has twobig boys to fight for the reform she has upheld all her life. Thetown is better than it was in those days, and if we each do our partfaithfully, it will improve yet more. Every boy and girl who joins isone gained, perhaps, and your example is the best temperancelecture you can give. Hold fast, and don't mind if it isn't 'jolly': it isright, and that should be enough for us."Mamma spoke warmly, for she heartily believed in young people'sguarding against this dangerous vice before it became atemptation, and hoped her boys would never break the pledge theyhad taken; for, young as they were, they were old enough to see itsworth, feel its wisdom, and pride themselves on the promise whichwas fast growing into a principle. Jack's face brightened as helistened, and Frank said, with the steady look which made his facemanly,"It shall be. Now I'll tell you what I was going to keep as a surprisetill to-night, for I wanted to have my secret as well as other folks.</p> 
<p>　　Ed and I went up to see Bob, Sunday, and he said he'd join theLodge, if they'd have him. I'm going to propose him to-night.""Good! good!" cried Jack, joyfully, and Mrs. Minot clapped herhands, for every new member was rejoiced over by the goodpeople, who were not discouraged by ridicule, indifference, oropposition.</p> 
<p>　　"We've got him now, for no one will object, and it is just the thingfor him. He wants to belong somewhere, he says, and he'll enjoythe fun, and the good things will help him, and we will look afterhim, The Captain was so pleased, and you ought to have seen Ed'sface when Bob said, 'I'm ready, if you'll have me."Frank's own face was beaming, and Jack forgot to "gobble," he wasso interested in the new Convert, while Mamma said, as she threwdown her napkin and took up the newspaper,"We must not forget our 'Observer,' but have a good one tonight inhonor of the occasion. There may be something here. Come homeearly at noon, and I'll help you get your paper ready.""I'll be here, but if you want Frank, you'd better tell him not todawdle over Annette's gate half an hour," began Jack, who couldnot resist teasing his dignified brother about one of the few foolishthings he was fond of doing.</p> 
<p>　　"Do you want your nose pulled?" demanded Frank, who neverwould stand joking on that tender point from his brother.</p> 
<p>　　"No, I don't; and if I did, you couldn't do it"; with which taunt hewas off and Frank after him, having made a futile dive at theimpertinent little nose which was turned up at him and hissweetheart.</p> 
<p>　　"Boys, boys, not through the parlor!" implored Mamma, resignedto skirmishes, but trembling for her piano legs as the four stoutboots pranced about the table and then went thundering down thehail, through the kitchen where the fat cook cheered them on, andMary, the maid, tried to head off Frank as Jack rushed out into thegarden. But the pursuer ducked under her arm and gave chase withall speed. Then there was a glorious race all over the place; forboth were good runners, and, being as full of spring vigor as friskycalves, they did astonishing things in the way of leaping fences,dodging round corners, and making good time down the widewalks.</p> 
<p>　　But Jack's leg was not quite strong yet, and he felt that his roundnose was in danger of a vengeful tweak as his breath began to giveout and Frank's long arms drew nearer and nearer to the threatenedfeature. Just when he was about to give up and meet his fate like aman, old Bunny, who had been much excited by the race, camescampering across the path with such a droll skip into the air andshake of the hind legs that Frank had to dodge to avoid stepping onhim, and to laugh in spite of himself. This momentary check gaveJack a chance to bolt up the back stairs and take refuge in the BirdRoom, from the window of which Jill had been watching the racewith great interest.</p> 
<p>　　No romping was allowed there, so a truce was made by lockinglittle fingers, and both sat down to get their breath.</p> 
<p>　　"I am to go on the piazza, for an hour, by and by, Doctor said.</p> 
<p>　　Would you mind carrying me down before you go to school, youdo it so nicely, I'm not a bit afraid," said Jill, as eager for the littlechange as if it had been a long and varied journey.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes, indeed! Come on, Princess," answered Jack, glad to see herso well and happy.</p> 
<p>　　The boys made an arm-chair, and away she went, for a pleasantday downstairs. She thanked Frank with a posy for his buttonhole,well knowing that it would soon pass into other hands, and hedeparted to join Annette. Having told Jill about Bob, and set her towork on the "Observer," Jack kissed his mother, and wentwhistling down the street, a gay little bachelor, with a nod andsmile for all he met, and no turned-up hat or jaunty turban bobbingalong beside him to delay his steps or trouble his peace of mind.</p> 
<p>　　At noon they worked on their paper, which was a collection ofitems, cut from other papers, concerning temperance, a fewanecdotes, a bit of poetry, a story, and, if possible, an originalarticle by the editor. Many hands make light work, and nothingremained but a little copying, which Jill promised to do beforenight. So the boys had time for a game of football after school inthe afternoon, which they much enjoyed. As they sat resting on theposts, Gus said,"Uncle Fred says he will give us a hay-cart ride to-night, as it ismoony, and after it you are all to come to our house and havegames.</p> 
<p>　　"Can't do it," answered Frank, sadly.</p> 
<p>　　"Lodge," groaned Jack, for both considered a drive in the cart,where they all sat in a merry bunch among the hay, one of the joysof life, and much regretted that a prior engagement would preventtheir sharing in it.</p> 
<p>　　That s a pity! I forgot it was Tuesday, and can'tput it off, as I'veasked all the rest. Give up your old Lodge and come along," saidGus, who had not joined yet.</p> 
<p>　　"We might for once, perhaps, but I don't like to"--began Jack,hesitating.</p> 
<p>　　"I won't. Who's to propose Bob if we don't? I want to go awfully;but I wouldn't disappoint Bob for a good deal, now he is willing tocome." And Frank sprang off his post as if anxious to fleetemptation, for it was very pleasant to go singing, up hill and downdale, in the spring moonlight, with--well, the fellows of his set.</p> 
<p>　　"Nor Ed, I forgot that. No, we can't go. We want to be GoodTemplars, and we mustn't shirk," added Jack, following hisbrother.</p> 
<p>　　"Better come. Can't put it off. Lots of fun," called Gus,disappointed at losing two of his favorite mates.</p> 
<p>　　But the boys did not turn back, and as they went steadily away theyfelt that they were doing their little part in the good work, andmaking their small sacrifices, like faithful members.</p> 
<p>　　They got their reward, however, for at home they found Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Chauncey, a good and great man, from England, who had knowntheir grandfather, and was an honored friend of the family. Theboys loved to hear him talk, and all tea-time listened with interestto the conversation, for Mr. Chauncey was a reformer as well as afamous clergyman, and it was like inspiring music to hear him tellabout the world's work, and the brave men and women who werecarrying it on. Eager to show that they had, at least, begun, theboys told him about their Lodge, and were immensely pleasedwhen their guest took from his pocket-book a worn paper, provingthat he too was a Good Templar, and belonged to the same army asthey did. Nor was that all, for when they reluctantly excusedthemselves, Mr. Chauncey gave each a hearty "grip," and said,holding their hands in his, as he smiled at the young faces lookingup at him with so much love and honor in them,"Tell the brothers and Sisters that if I can serve them in anywaywhile here, to command me. I will give them a lecture at theirLodge or in public, whichever they like; and I wish you God-speed,dear boys."Two prouder lads never walked the streets than Frank and Jack asthey hurried away, nearly forgetting the poor little paper in theirhaste to tell the good news; for it was seldom that such an offerwas made the Lodge, and they felt the honor done them as bearersof it.</p> 
<p>　　As the secrets of the association cannot be divulged to theuninitiated, we can only say that there was great rejoicing over thenew member, for Bob was unanimously welcomed, and muchgratitude both felt and expressed for Mr. Chauncey's interest in thissmall division of the grand army; for these good folk met withlittle sympathy from the great people of the town, and it was verycheering to have a well-known and much-beloved man say a wordfor them. All agreed that the lecture should be public, that othersmight share the pleasure with them, and perhaps be converted by ahigher eloquence than any they possessed.</p> 
<p>　　So the services that night were unusually full of spirit and goodcheer; for all felt the influence of a friendly word, the beauty of afine example. The paper was much applauded, the songs were veryhearty, and when Frank, whose turn it was to be chaplain, read theclosing prayer, everyone felt that they had much to give thanks for,since one more had joined them, and the work was slowly gettingon with unexpected helpers sent to lend a hand. The lights shoneout from the little hall across the street, the music reached the earsof passers-by, and the busy hum of voices up there told howfaithfully some, at least, of the villagers tried to make the town asafer place for their boys to grow up in, though the tavern still hadits private bar and the saloon-door stood open to invite them in.</p> 
<p>　　There are many such quiet lodges, and in them many young peoplelearning as these lads were learning something of the duty theyowed their neighbors as well as themselves, and being fitted tobecome good men and sober citizens by practising and preachingthe law and gospel of temperance.</p> 
<p>　　The next night Mr. Chauncey lectured, and the town turned out tohear the distinguishei man, who not only told them of the crimeand misery produced by this terrible vice which afflicted bothEngland and America, but of the great crusade against it going oneverywhere, and the need of courage, patience, hard work, andmuch faith, that in time it might be overcome. Strong and cheerfulwords that all liked to hear and many heartily believed, especiallythe young Templars, whose boyish fancies were won by the idea offighting as knights of old did in the famous crusades they readabout in their splendid new young folks' edition of Froissart.</p> 
<p>　　"We can't pitch into people as the Red Cross fellows did, but wecan smash rum-jugs when we get the chance, and stand by our flagas our men did in the war," said Frank, with sparkling eyes, as theywent home in the moonlight arm in arm, keeping step behind Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Chauncey, who led the way with their mother on his arm, a martialfigure though a minister, and a good captain to follow, as the boysfelt after hearing his stirring words.</p> 
<p>　　"Let's try and get up a company of boys like those mother told usabout, and show people that we mean what we say. I'll becolor-bearer, and you may drill us as much as you like. A real ColdWater Army, with flags flying, and drums, and all sorts of larks,"said Jack, much excited, and taking a dramatic view of the matter.</p> 
<p>　　"We'll see about it. Something ought to be done, and perhaps weshall be the men to do it when the time comes," answered Frank,feeling ready to shoulder a musket or be a minute-man in goodearnest.</p> 
<p>　　Boyish talk and enthusiasm, but it was of the right sort; and whentime and training had fitted them to bear arms, these young knightswould be worthy to put on the red cross and ride away to help rightthe wrongs and slay the dragons that afflict the world.</p>
