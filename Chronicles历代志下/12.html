<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the LORD, and all Israel with him.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now when Rehoboam's position as king had been made certain, and he was strong, he gave up the law of the Lord, and all Israel with him.
<br>12:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;罗 波 安 王 第 五 年 ， 埃 及 王 示 撒 上 来 攻 打 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 因 为 王 和 民 得 罪 了 耶 和 华 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the LORD,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem, because of their sin against the Lord,
<br>12:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;示 撒 带 战 车 一 千 二 百 辆 ， 马 兵 六 万 ， 并 且 跟 从 他 出 埃 及 的 路 比 人 ， 苏 基 人 ， 和 古 实 人 ， 多 得 不 可 胜 数 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;With twelve hundred war-carriages and sixty thousand horsemen: and the people who came with him out of Egypt were more than might be numbered: Lubim and Sukkiim and Ethiopians.
<br>12:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 攻 取 了 犹 大 的 坚 固 城 ， 就 来 到 耶 路 撒 冷 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and came to Jerusalem.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he took the walled towns of Judah, and came as far as Jerusalem.
<br>12:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 时 ， 犹 大 的 首 领 因 为 示 撒 就 聚 集 在 耶 路 撒 冷 。 有 先 知 示 玛 雅 去 见 罗 波 安 和 众 首 领 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 你 们 离 弃 了 我 ， 所 以 我 使 你 们 落 在 示 撒 手 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of Shishak.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the chiefs of Judah, who had come together in Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, The Lord has said, Because you have given me up, I have given you up into the hands of Shishak.
<br>12:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 王 和 以 色 列 的 众 首 领 都 自 卑 说 ， 耶 和 华 是 公 义 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then the chiefs of Israel and the king made themselves low and said, The Lord is upright.
<br>12:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 和 华 见 他 们 自 卑 ， 耶 和 华 的 话 就 临 到 示 玛 雅 说 ， 他 们 既 自 卑 ， 我 必 不 灭 绝 他 们 。 必 使 他 们 略 得 拯 救 ， 我 不 借 着 示 撒 的 手 将 我 的 怒 气 倒 在 耶 路 撒 冷 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the Lord, seeing that they had made themselves low, said to Shemaiah, They have made themselves low: I will not send destruction on them, but in a short time I will give them salvation, and will not let loose my wrath on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
<br>12:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;然 而 他 们 必 作 示 撒 的 仆 人 ， 好 叫 他 们 知 道 ， 服 事 我 与 服 事 外 邦 人 有 何 分 别 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But still they will become his servants, so that they may see how different my yoke is from the yoke of the kingdoms of the lands.
<br>12:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 ， 埃 及 王 示 撒 上 来 攻 取 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 夺 了 耶 和 华 殿 和 王 宫 里 的 宝 物 ， 尽 都 带 走 ， 又 夺 去 所 罗 门 制 造 的 金 盾 牌 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the shields of gold which Solomon had made.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem and took away all the stored wealth of the house of the Lord and the king's house: he took everything away, and with the rest the gold body-covers which Solomon had made.
<br>12:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;罗 波 安 王 制 造 铜 盾 牌 代 替 那 金 盾 牌 ， 交 给 守 王 宫 门 的 护 卫 长 看 守 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that kept the entrance of the king's house.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And in their place King Rehoboam had other body-covers made of brass and gave them into the care of the captains of the armed men who were stationed at the door of the king's house.
<br>12:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;王 每 逢 进 耶 和 华 的 殿 ， 护 卫 兵 就 拿 这 盾 牌 ， 随 后 仍 将 盾 牌 送 回 ， 放 在 护 卫 房 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the guard chamber.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And whenever the king went into the house of the Lord, the armed men went with him taking the body-covers, and then took them back to their room.
<br>12:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;王 自 卑 的 时 候 ， 耶 和 华 的 怒 气 就 转 消 了 ， 不 将 他 灭 尽 ， 并 且 在 犹 大 中 间 也 有 善 益 的 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in Judah things went well.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when he made himself low, the wrath of the Lord was turned back from him, and complete destruction did not come on him, for there was still some good in Judah.
<br>12:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;罗 波 安 王 自 强 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 王 。 他 登 基 的 时 候 年 四 十 一 岁 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 就 是 耶 和 华 从 以 色 列 众 支 派 中 所 选 择 立 他 名 的 城 ， 作 王 十 七 年 。 罗 波 安 的 母 亲 名 叫 拿 玛 ， 是 亚 扪 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So King Rehoboam made himself strong in Jerusalem and was ruling there. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king, and he was ruling for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the town which the Lord had made his out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there; and his mother's name was Naamah, an Ammonite woman.
<br>12:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;罗 波 安 行 恶 ， 因 他 不 立 定 心 意 寻 求 耶 和 华 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he did evil because his heart was not true to the Lord.
<br>12:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;罗 波 安 所 行 的 事 ， 自 始 至 终 不 都 写 在 先 知 示 玛 雅 和 先 见 易 多 的 史 记 上 吗 ？ 罗 波 安 与 耶 罗 波 安 时 常 争 战 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not recorded in the words of Shemaiah the prophet and Iddo the seer? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.
<br>12:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;罗 波 安 与 他 列 祖 同 睡 ， 葬 在 大 卫 城 里 。 他 儿 子 亚 比 雅 接 续 他 作 王 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Rehoboam went to rest with his fathers, and was put into the earth in the town of David; and Abijah his son became king in his place.
