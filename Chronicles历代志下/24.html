<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was Zibiah of Beersheba.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he was ruling for forty years in Jerusalem: his mother's name was Zibiah of Beer-sheba.
<br>24:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;祭 司 耶 何 耶 大 在 世 的 时 候 ， 约 阿 施 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 正 的 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD all the days of Jehoiada the priest.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Joash did what was right in the eyes of the Lord as long as Jehoiada the priest was living.
<br>24:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 何 耶 大 为 他 娶 了 两 个 妻 ， 并 且 生 儿 养 女 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and daughters.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jehoiada took two wives for him, and he became the father of sons and daughters.
<br>24:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;此 后 ， 约 阿 施 有 意 重 修 耶 和 华 的 殿 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to repair the house of the LORD.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now after this Joash had a desire to put the house of the Lord into good order again;
<br>24:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;便 召 聚 众 祭 司 和 利 未 人 ， 吩 咐 他 们 说 ， 你 们 要 往 犹 大 各 城 去 ， 使 以 色 列 众 人 捐 纳 银 子 ， 每 年 可 以 修 理 你 们 神 的 殿 。 你 们 要 急 速 办 理 这 事 。 只 是 利 未 人 不 急 速 办 理 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites hastened it not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And getting together the priests and Levites, he said to them, Go out into the towns of Judah year by year, and get from all Israel money to keep the house of your God in good condition; and see that this is done without loss of time. The Levites, however, were slow in doing so.
<br>24:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;王 召 了 大 祭 司 耶 何 耶 大 来 ， 对 他 说 ， 从 前 耶 和 华 的 仆 人 摩 西 ， 为 法 柜 的 帐 幕 与 以 色 列 会 众 所 定 的 捐 项 ， 你 为 何 不 叫 利 未 人 照 这 例 从 犹 大 和 耶 路 撒 冷 带 来 作 殿 的 费 用 呢 ？
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then the king sent for Jehoiada, the chief priest, and said to him, Why have you not given the Levites orders that the tax fixed by Moses, the servant of the Lord, and by the meeting of Israel, for the Tent of witness, is to be got in from Judah and Jerusalem and handed over?
<br>24:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 为 那 恶 妇 亚 他 利 雅 的 众 子 曾 拆 毁 神 的 殿 ， 又 用 耶 和 华 殿 中 分 别 为 圣 的 物 供 奉 巴 力 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For the house of the Lord had been broken up by Athaliah, that evil woman, and her sons; and all its holy things they had given to the Baals.
<br>24:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 王 下 令 ， 众 人 作 了 一 柜 ， 放 在 耶 和 华 殿 的 门 外 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it without at the gate of the house of the LORD.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So at the king's order they made a chest and put it outside the doorway of the house of the Lord.
<br>24:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 通 告 犹 大 和 耶 路 撒 冷 的 百 姓 ， 要 将 神 仆 人 摩 西 在 旷 野 所 吩 咐 以 色 列 人 的 捐 项 给 耶 和 华 送 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And an order was sent out through all Judah and Jerusalem that payment was to be made to the Lord of the tax which Moses, the servant of God, had put on Israel in the waste land.
<br>24:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 首 领 和 百 姓 都 欢 欢 喜 喜 地 将 银 子 送 来 ， 投 入 柜 中 ， 直 到 捐 完 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And all the chiefs and all the people came gladly and put their money into the chest, till they had all given.
<br>24:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;利 未 人 见 银 子 多 了 ， 就 把 柜 抬 到 王 所 派 的 司 事 面 前 。 王 的 书 记 和 大 祭 司 的 属 员 来 将 柜 倒 空 ， 仍 放 在 原 处 。 日 日 都 是 这 样 ， 积 蓄 的 银 子 甚 多 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it, and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So when the chest was taken to the king's servants by the Levites, and they saw that there was much money in it, the king's scribe and the chief priest's servant took the money out, and put the chest back in its place. They did this day by day, and got together a great amount of money.
<br>24:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;王 与 耶 何 耶 大 将 银 子 交 给 耶 和 华 殿 里 办 事 的 人 ， 他 们 就 雇 了 石 匠 ， 木 匠 重 修 耶 和 华 的 殿 ， 又 雇 了 铁 匠 ， 铜 匠 修 理 耶 和 华 的 殿 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then the king and Jehoiada gave it to those who were responsible for getting the work done on the Lord's house, and with it they got wall-builders and woodworkers and metal-workers to put the house of the Lord in good order again.
<br>24:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;工 人 操 作 ， 渐 渐 修 成 ， 将 神 殿 修 造 得 与 从 前 一 样 ， 而 且 甚 是 坚 固 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them, and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So the workmen did their work, making good what was damaged and building up the house of God till it was strong and beautiful again.
<br>24:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;工 程 完 了 ， 他 们 就 把 其 余 的 银 子 拿 到 王 与 耶 何 耶 大 面 前 ， 用 以 制 造 耶 和 华 殿 供 奉 所 用 的 器 皿 和 调 羹 ， 并 金 银 的 器 皿 。 耶 何 耶 大 在 世 的 时 候 ， 众 人 常 在 耶 和 华 殿 里 献 燔 祭 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD continually all the days of Jehoiada.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the work was done, they took the rest of the money to the king and Jehoiada, and it was used for making the vessels for the house of the Lord, all the vessels needed for the offerings, the spoons and the vessels of gold and silver. And as long as Jehoiada was living, the regular burned offerings were offered in the house of the Lord.
<br>24:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 何 耶 大 年 纪 老 迈 ， 日 子 满 足 而 死 。 死 的 时 候 年 一 百 三 十 岁 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But Jehoiada became old and full of days, and he came to his end; he was a hundred and thirty years old at the time of his death.
<br>24:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;葬 在 大 卫 城 列 王 的 坟 墓 里 。 因 为 他 在 以 色 列 人 中 行 善 ， 又 事 奉 神 ， 修 理 神 的 殿 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they buried him in the city of David among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and toward his house.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they put him into his last resting-place in the town of David, among the kings, because he had done good in Israel for God and for his house.
<br>24:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 何 耶 大 死 后 ， 犹 大 的 众 首 领 来 朝 拜 王 。 王 就 听 从 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now after the death of Jehoiada, the chiefs of Judah came and went down on their faces before the king. Then the king gave ear to them.
<br>24:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 离 弃 耶 和 华 他 们 列 祖 神 的 殿 ， 去 事 奉 亚 舍 拉 和 偶 像 。 因 他 们 这 罪 ， 就 有 忿 怒 临 到 犹 大 和 耶 路 撒 冷 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and Jerusalem for this their trespass.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they gave up the house of the Lord God of their fathers, and became worshippers of pillars of wood and of the images; and because of this sin of theirs, wrath came on Judah and Jerusalem.
<br>24:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 神 仍 遣 先 知 到 他 们 那 里 ， 引 导 他 们 归 向 耶 和 华 。 这 先 知 警 戒 他 们 ， 他 们 却 不 肯 听 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give ear.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the Lord sent them prophets to make them come back to him; and they gave witness against them, but they would not give ear.
<br>24:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 时 ， 神 的 灵 感 动 祭 司 耶 何 耶 大 的 儿 子 撒 迦 利 亚 ， 他 就 站 在 上 面 对 民 说 ， 神 如 此 说 ， 你 们 为 何 干 犯 耶 和 华 的 诫 命 ， 以 致 不 得 亨 通 呢 ？ 因 为 你 们 离 弃 耶 和 华 ， 所 以 他 也 离 弃 你 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them, Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the LORD, he hath also forsaken you.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then the spirit of God came on Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada the priest, and, getting up before the people, he said to them, God has said, Why do you go against the orders of the Lord, so that everything goes badly for you? because you have given up the Lord, he has given you up.
<br>24:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;众 民 同 心 谋 害 撒 迦 利 亚 ， 就 照 王 的 吩 咐 ， 在 耶 和 华 殿 的 院 内 用 石 头 打 死 他 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the LORD.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But when they had made a secret design against him, he was stoned with stones, by the king's order, in the outer square of the Lord's house.
<br>24:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 样 ， 约 阿 施 王 不 想 念 撒 迦 利 亚 的 父 亲 耶 何 耶 大 向 自 己 所 施 的 恩 ， 杀 了 他 的 儿 子 。 撒 迦 利 亚 临 死 的 时 候 说 ， 愿 耶 和 华 鉴 察 伸 冤 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So King Joash did not keep in mind how good Jehoiada his father had been to him, but put his son to death. And in the hour of his death he said, May the Lord see it and take payment!
<br>24:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;满 了 一 年 ， 亚 兰 的 军 兵 上 来 攻 击 约 阿 施 ， 来 到 犹 大 和 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 杀 了 民 中 的 众 首 领 ， 将 所 掠 的 财 货 送 到 大 马 色 王 那 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now in the spring, the army of the Aramaeans came up against him; they came against Judah and Jerusalem, putting to death all the great men of the people and sending all the goods they took from them to the king of Damascus.
<br>24:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;亚 兰 的 军 兵 虽 来 了 一 小 队 ， 耶 和 华 却 将 大 队 的 军 兵 交 在 他 们 手 里 ， 是 因 犹 大 人 离 弃 耶 和 华 他 们 列 祖 的 神 ， 所 以 借 亚 兰 人 惩 罚 约 阿 施 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men, and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand, because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So they executed judgment against Joash.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For though the army of Aram was only a small one, the Lord gave a very great army into their hands, because they had given up the Lord, the God of their fathers. So they put into effect the punishment of Joash.
<br>24:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;亚 兰 人 离 开 约 阿 施 的 时 候 ， 他 患 重 病 。 臣 仆 背 叛 他 ， 要 报 祭 司 耶 何 耶 大 儿 子 流 血 之 仇 ， 杀 他 在 床 上 ， 葬 他 在 大 卫 城 ， 只 是 不 葬 在 列 王 的 坟 墓 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when they had gone away from him, (for he was broken with disease,) his servants made a secret design against him because of the blood of the son of Jehoiada the priest, and they put him to death on his bed; and they put his body into the earth in the town of David, but not in the resting-place of the kings.
<br>24:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;背 叛 他 的 是 亚 扪 妇 人 示 米 押 的 儿 子 撒 拔 和 摩 押 妇 人 示 米 利 的 儿 子 约 萨 拔 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a Moabitess.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Those who made designs against him were Zabad, the son of Shimeath, an Ammonite woman, and Jehozabad, the son of Shimrith, a Moabite woman.
<br>24:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;至 于 他 的 众 子 和 他 所 受 的 警 戒 ， 并 他 重 修 神 殿 的 事 ， 都 写 在 列 王 的 传 上 。 他 儿 子 亚 玛 谢 接 续 他 作 王 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son reigned in his stead.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now the story of his sons, and all the words said by the prophet against him, and the building up again of the Lord's house, are recorded in the account in the book of the kings. And Amaziah his son became king in his place.
