<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So all the work which Solomon did for the house of the Lord was complete. And Solomon took the holy things which David his father had given, the silver and the gold and all the vessels, and put them in the store-houses of the house of God.
<br>5:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 时 ， 所 罗 门 将 以 色 列 的 长 老 ， 各 支 派 的 首 领 ， 并 以 色 列 的 族 长 招 聚 到 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 要 把 耶 和 华 的 约 柜 从 大 卫 城 就 是 锡 安 运 上 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Solomon sent for all the responsible men of Israel, all the chiefs of the tribes and the heads of families of the children of Israel, to come to Jerusalem and take the ark of the Lord's agreement up out of the town of David, which is Zion.
<br>5:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;于 是 以 色 列 众 人 在 七 月 节 前 都 聚 集 到 王 那 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And all the men of Israel came together to the king at the feast in the seventh month.
<br>5:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;以 色 列 众 长 老 来 到 ， 利 未 人 便 抬 起 约 柜 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the ark.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;All the responsible men of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark.
<br>5:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;祭 司 利 未 人 将 约 柜 运 上 来 ， 又 将 会 幕 和 会 幕 的 一 切 圣 器 具 都 带 上 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;They took up the ark and the Tent of meeting and all the holy vessels which were in the Tent; all these the priests, the Levites, took up.
<br>5:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;所 罗 门 王 和 聚 集 到 他 那 里 的 以 色 列 全 会 众 都 在 约 柜 前 献 牛 羊 为 祭 ， 多 得 不 可 胜 数 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And King Solomon and all the men of Israel who had come together there with him, were before the ark, making offerings of sheep and oxen more than might be numbered.
<br>5:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;祭 司 将 耶 和 华 的 约 柜 抬 进 内 殿 ， 就 是 至 圣 所 ， 放 在 两 个 基 路 伯 的 翅 膀 底 下 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place, even under the wings of the cherubims:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the priests took the ark of the Lord's agreement and put it in its place, in the inner room of the house, in the most holy place, under the wings of the winged ones.
<br>5:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;基 路 伯 张 着 翅 膀 在 约 柜 之 上 ， 遮 掩 约 柜 和 抬 柜 的 杠 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For their wings were outstretched over the place where the ark was, covering the ark and its rods.
<br>5:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 杠 甚 长 ， 杠 头 在 内 殿 前 可 以 看 见 ， 在 殿 外 却 不 能 看 见 ， 直 到 如 今 还 在 那 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen without. And there it is unto this day.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;The rods were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place before the inmost room; but they were not seen from outside; and there they are to this day.
<br>5:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;约 柜 里 惟 有 两 块 石 版 ， 就 是 以 色 列 人 出 埃 及 后 ， 耶 和 华 与 他 们 立 约 的 时 候 ， 摩 西 在 何 烈 山 所 放 的 。 除 此 以 外 ， 并 无 别 物 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Nothing was in the ark but the two flat stones which Moses put there at Horeb, where the Lord made an agreement with the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt.
<br>5:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;当 时 ， 在 那 里 所 有 的 祭 司 都 已 自 洁 ， 并 不 分 班 供 职 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did not then wait by course:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now when the priests had come out of the holy place, (for all the priests who were present had made themselves holy, not keeping to their divisions;
<br>5:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 出 圣 所 的 时 候 ， 歌 唱 的 利 未 人 亚 萨 ， 希 幔 ， 耶 杜 顿 ， 和 他 们 的 众 子 众 弟 兄 都 穿 细 麻 布 衣 服 ， 站 在 坛 的 东 边 ， 敲 钹 ， 鼓 瑟 ， 弹 琴 ， 同 着 他 们 有 一 百 二 十 个 祭 司 吹 号 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph, of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the Levites who made the music, all of them, Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and brothers, robed in fair linen, were in their places with their brass and corded instruments at the east side of the altar, and with them a hundred and twenty priests blowing horns;)
<br>5:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;吹 号 的 ， 歌 唱 的 都 一 齐 发 声 ， 声 合 为 一 ， 赞 美 感 谢 耶 和 华 。 吹 号 ， 敲 钹 ， 用 各 种 乐 器 ， 扬 声 赞 美 耶 和 华 说 ， 耶 和 华 本 为 善 ， 他 的 慈 爱 永 远 长 存 。 那 时 ， 耶 和 华 的 殿 有 云 充 满 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the house of the LORD;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And when the players on horns, and those who made melody in song, with one voice were sounding the praise and glory of the Lord; with loud voices and with wind instruments, and brass and corded instruments of music, praising the Lord and saying, He is good; his mercy is unchanging for ever: then the house was full of the cloud of the glory of the Lord,
<br>5:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;甚 至 祭 司 不 能 站 立 供 职 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 的 荣 光 充 满 了 神 的 殿 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So that the priests were not able to keep their places to do their work because of the cloud; for the house of God was full of the glory of the Lord.
