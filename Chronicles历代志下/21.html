<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And Jehoshaphat went to rest with his fathers, and his body was put into the earth in the town of David. And Jehoram his son became king in his place.
<br>21:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;约 兰 有 几 个 兄 弟 ， 就 是 约 沙 法 的 儿 子 亚 撒 利 雅 ， 耶 歇 ， 撒 迦 利 雅 ， 亚 撒 利 雅 ， 米 迦 勒 ， 示 法 提 雅 。 这 都 是 犹 大 王 约 沙 法 的 儿 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And he had brothers, sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were sons of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel.
<br>21:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 的 父 亲 将 许 多 金 银 ， 财 宝 ， 和 犹 大 地 的 坚 固 城 赐 给 他 们 。 但 将 国 赐 给 约 兰 ， 因 为 他 是 长 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And their father gave them much silver and gold and things of great value, as well as walled towns in Judah; but the kingdom he gave to Jehoram, because he was the oldest.
<br>21:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;约 兰 兴 起 坐 他 父 的 位 ， 奋 勇 自 强 ， 就 用 刀 杀 了 他 的 众 兄 弟 和 以 色 列 的 几 个 首 领 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now when Jehoram had taken his place over his father's kingdom, and had made his position safe, he put all his brothers to death with the sword, as well as some of the princes of Israel.
<br>21:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;约 兰 登 基 的 时 候 年 三 十 二 岁 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 王 八 年 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king; and he was ruling in Jerusalem for eight years.
<br>21:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 行 以 色 列 诸 王 的 道 ， 与 亚 哈 家 一 样 。 因 他 娶 了 亚 哈 的 女 儿 为 妻 ， 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife: and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He went in the ways of the kings of Israel, and did as the family of Ahab did, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife; and he did evil in the eyes of the Lord.
<br>21:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 和 华 却 因 自 己 与 大 卫 所 立 的 约 ， 不 肯 灭 大 卫 的 家 ， 照 他 所 应 许 的 ， 永 远 赐 灯 光 与 大 卫 和 他 的 子 孙 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But it was not the Lord's purpose to send destruction on the family of David, because of the agreement he had made with David, when he said he would give to him and to his sons a light for ever.
<br>21:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;约 兰 年 间 ， 以 东 人 背 叛 犹 大 ， 脱 离 他 的 权 下 ， 自 己 立 王 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of Judah, and made themselves a king.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;In his time Edom made themselves free from the rule of Judah, and took a king for themselves.
<br>21:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;约 兰 就 率 领 军 长 和 所 有 的 战 车 ， 夜 间 起 来 ， 攻 击 围 困 他 的 以 东 人 和 车 兵 长 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Jehoram went over with his captains and all his war-carriages ... made an attack by night on the Edomites, whose forces were all round him ... on the captains of the war-carriages.
<br>21:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 样 ， 以 东 人 背 叛 犹 大 ， 脱 离 他 的 权 下 ， 直 到 今 日 。 那 时 ， 立 拿 人 也 背 叛 了 ， 因 为 约 兰 离 弃 耶 和 华 他 列 祖 的 神 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So Edom made themselves free from the rule of Judah, to this day: and at the same time Libnah made itself free from his rule; because he was turned away from the Lord, the God of his fathers.
<br>21:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 又 在 犹 大 诸 山 建 筑 丘 坛 ， 使 耶 路 撒 冷 的 居 民 行 邪 淫 ， 诱 惑 犹 大 人 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and compelled Judah thereto.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And more than this, he made high places in the mountains of Judah, teaching the people of Jerusalem to go after false gods, and guiding Judah away from the true way.
<br>21:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;先 知 以 利 亚 达 信 与 约 兰 说 ， 耶 和 华 你 祖 大 卫 的 神 如 此 说 ， 因 为 你 不 行 你 父 约 沙 法 和 犹 大 王 亚 撒 的 道 ，
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father, nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And a letter came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, The Lord, the God of your father David, says, Because you have not kept to the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or the ways of Asa, king of Judah,
<br>21:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;乃 行 以 色 列 诸 王 的 道 ， 使 犹 大 人 和 耶 路 撒 冷 的 居 民 行 邪 淫 ， 像 亚 哈 家 一 样 ， 又 杀 了 你 父 家 比 你 好 的 诸 兄 弟 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring, like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were better than thyself:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But have gone in the way of the kings of Israel, and have made Judah and the people of Jerusalem go after false gods, as the family of Ahab did: and because you have put to death your father's sons, your brothers, who were better than yourself:
<br>21:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;故 此 ， 耶 和 华 降 大 灾 与 你 的 百 姓 和 你 的 妻 子 ， 儿 女 ， 并 你 一 切 所 有 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people, and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now, truly, the Lord will send a great destruction on your people and your children and your wives and everything which is yours:
<br>21:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 的 肠 子 必 患 病 ， 日 加 沉 重 ， 以 致 你 的 肠 子 坠 落 下 来 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And you yourself will undergo the cruel pains of a disease in your stomach, so that day by day your inside will be falling out because of the disease.
<br>21:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;以 后 ， 耶 和 华 激 动 非 利 士 人 和 靠 近 古 实 的 亚 拉 伯 人 来 攻 击 约 兰 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then the Philistines and the Arabians, who are by Ethiopia, were moved by the Lord to make war on Jehoram;
<br>21:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 上 来 攻 击 犹 大 ， 侵 入 境 内 ， 掳 掠 了 王 宫 里 所 有 的 财 货 和 他 的 妻 子 ， 儿 女 ， 除 了 他 小 儿 子 约 哈 斯 （ 又 名 亚 哈 谢 ） 之 外 ， 没 有 留 下 一 个 儿 子 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they came up against Judah, forcing a way into it, and took away all the goods in the king's house, as well as his sons and his wives; so that he had no son but only Jehoahaz, the youngest.
<br>21:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 些 事 以 后 ， 耶 和 华 使 约 兰 的 肠 子 患 不 能 医 治 的 病 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And after all this the Lord sent on him a disease of the stomach from which it was impossible for him to be made well.
<br>21:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 患 此 病 缠 绵 日 久 ， 过 了 二 年 ， 肠 子 坠 落 下 来 ， 病 重 而 死 。 他 的 民 没 有 为 他 烧 什 么 物 件 ， 像 从 前 为 他 列 祖 所 烧 的 一 样 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And time went on, and after two years, his inside falling out because of the disease, he came to his death in cruel pain. And his people made no burning for him like the burning made for his fathers.
<br>21:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;约 兰 登 基 的 时 候 年 三 十 二 岁 ， 在 耶 路 撒 冷 作 王 八 年 。 他 去 世 无 人 思 慕 ， 众 人 葬 他 在 大 卫 城 ， 只 是 不 在 列 王 的 坟 墓 里 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he was ruling in Jerusalem for eight years: and at his death he was not regretted; they put his body into the earth in the town of David, but not in the resting-place of the kings.
