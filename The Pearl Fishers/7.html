There had been strong winds blowing for the last week and big seas tumbling along the reef, the spray finding the oysters that they had put out on the coral, otherwise they might not only have rotted, but dried up. As it was, they were just in the prime of their horribleness.
<br> 
<br> "Good heavens!" said Floyd, as they set to work. "This is worse than salving cargo—a jolly sight worse even than diving."
<br> 
<br> "You'll get used to it," said Schumer, "and if it's any comfort to you to know it's worse for me than you, for I have an olfactory sense more acute than ordinary. Get more to windward of your work. You ought to know that as a sailor."
<br> 
<br> "Upon my word!" said Floyd, "these things must have half stunned me; they are enough to make one forget one's instincts, even. Go ahead, I won't complain."
<br> 
<br> He got to windward, and the stiff breeze helped matters considerably. Schumer had brought a piece of sailcloth, also a canvas bucket, which they filled as required from a reef pool near by.
<br> 
<br> [Pg 66]Every shell was searched and washed over the canvas, Schumer, with the eye and hand of an expert, doing the manipulation while Floyd poured the water in trickles as required.
<br> 
<br> Dozen by dozen the shells were explored, drained of their mushy contents, and flung away. Not a pearl showed.
<br> 
<br> Floyd forgot everything in the excitement of the moment. He had no longer a sense of smell, and then, as the heap of shells steadily grew without sign or symptom of what they were in search of, his spirits fell.
<br> 
<br> "Pour away," said Schumer; "this is only the beginning of the business; there's no knowing what is to come. Ah, here's something!"
<br> 
<br> He stood up, poured some water into the palm of his hand, examined what was in his palm, and then held out his dripping hand to Floyd.
<br> 
<br> In the palm lay a small black stone about the size of a pea.
<br> 
<br> "What is it?" asked Floyd.
<br> 
<br> Schumer laughed.
<br> 
<br> "Only a black pearl, worth maybe a hundred dollars. But it's fortune, all the same. We have struck it! A hundred dollars for half an hour's work for two men. It's good!"
<br> 
<br> He sat down on the coral, while Floyd, now deeply excited, took his seat beside him. The gulls cried and wheeled overhead, and the sun burned on the blue sea and the foam of the reef, and the wind blew the spray in their faces as they sat handing their treasure from one to the other, examining it and gloating over it.
<br> 
<br> Washed and dried now, its luster appeared. It was[Pg 67] a perfect black pearl, not large, but of splendid quality, globular and slightly flattened on one side.
<br> 
<br> "It's worth more even than I thought at first," said Schumer. "It's a beauty. Well, we mustn't chuckle too soon; it may be the only pearl in the lagoon, though I don't think so. And the shell is of fine quality; all the indications are good."
<br> 
<br> "I thought all pearls were white," said Floyd. "Of course, I know nothing about them, and the only ones I have seen were in shop windows."
<br> 
<br> "And most likely false, at that," said Schumer. "No. Pearls are not all white. I don't know what makes the color in them, but there it is. Some are black like this, and a few are pink, and I've seen some gray—they aren't much good. Pink are the rarest, then come black, then white. Well, I'll put this fellow in my match box, and now let's get to work again."
<br> 
<br> He put the pearl in the match box and the box in the pocket of his coat, which he had taken off. Then, having placed a lump of coral on the coat to prevent any chance of the wind blowing it about, they returned to work.
<br> 
<br> They worked right through the whole take of shell, and the sun was setting when they had finished. The result was triumphant.
<br> 
<br> Twelve pearls was the harvest, including the black. Four of these were quite inconsiderable, but of good quality; four more, though larger, were not of good shape or quality, but there were three white beauties. The largest, Schumer estimated at a thousand dollars and over, the next largest at less than a thousand, and the third at five hundred.
<br> 
<br> [Pg 68]There were also some seed pearls, tiny things like nits' eggs.
<br> 
<br> "If the whole lagoon pays up like that," said Floyd, "we'll be rich ten times over."
<br> 
<br> Schumer shook his head.
<br> 
<br> "We can't tell. Nothing is more uncertain than pearling. We are sure to find blank streaks, and it's possible we may have just struck the richest corner. In a lagoon like this a lot depends on the different temperatures, the depth, and the rush of the currents. But we've done well, and a lot better than I expected."
<br> 
<br> They set off back across the lagoon to their camping place, and the day's take was placed in the box with the ship's money.
<br> 
<br> Schumer had suggested to Floyd that the money of the Cormorant should be placed with that of the Tonga in the same box, and Floyd had agreed, seeing the wisdom of centralizing their treasure so that in eventualities it might be more easily protected.
<br> 
<br> Together with the pearls the hoard made now a very respectable show, though Floyd had pointed out that the Cormorant money, being Coxon's, must not be counted in their mutual assets. Schumer had agreed, though evidently with reservations. The money of the Tonga was a different matter; he seemed to look on it as his own. Never once did he refer to it in other terms, nor had he told Floyd the name of the Tonga's skipper.
<br> 
<br> Floyd did not press the point—it was a matter entirely to do with Schumer.
