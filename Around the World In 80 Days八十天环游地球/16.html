She was as fast, but not as well fitted up, as the `Mongolia', and Aouda was not as comfortably provided for on board of her as Phileas Fogg could have wished. However, the trip from Calcutta to Hong Kong only comprised some three thousand five hundred miles, occupying from ten to twelve days, and the young woman was not difficult to please. </p> 
<p>During the first days of the journey Aouda became better acquainted with her protector, and constantly gave evidence of her deep gratitude for what he had done. The phlegmatic gentleman listened to her, apparently at least, with coldness, neither his voice nor his manner betraying the slightest emotion; but he seemed to be always on the watch that nothing should be wanting to Aouda's comfort. He visited her regularly each day at certain hours, not so much to talk himself as to sit and hear her talk. He treated her with the stri tell him what kind of a fellow his master really was. That Passepartout was not Fogg's accomplice, he was very certain. The servant, enlightened by his disclosure, and afraid of being himself implicated in the crime,ster's eccentricity, and made her smile by telling her of the wager which was sending him round the world. After all, she owed Phileas Fogg her life, and she always regarded him through the exalting medium of her gratitude. </p> 
<p>Aouda confirmed the Parsee guide's narrative of her touching history. She didndeed, belong to the highest of the native races of India. Many of the Parsee merchants have made great fortunes there by dealing in cotton; and one of them, Sir Jametsee Jeejeebhoy, was made a baronet by the English government. Aouda was a relative of this great man, and it was his cousin Jeejeeh, whom she hoped to join at Hong Kong. Whether she would find a protector in him she could not tell; but Mr Fogg essayed to calm her anxieties, and to assure her that everything would be mathematically - he used the very word - arranged. Aouda fastened her great eyes, `clear as the sacred lakes of the Himalaya', upon him; but the intractable Fogg, as reserved as ever, did not seem at all inclined to throw himself into this lake. </p> 
<p>The first few days of the voyage passed prosperously, amid favourable weather and propitious winds, and they soon came in sight of the great Andaman, the principal of the islands in the Bay of Bengal, with its picturesque Saddle Peak, two thousand four hundred feet high, looming above the waters. The steamer passed along near the shores, but the savage Papuans, who are in the lowest scale of humanity, but are not, as has been asserted, cannibals, did not make their appearance. </p> 
<p>The panorama of the islands, as they steamed by them, was superb. Vast forests of palms, arecs, bamboo, teakwood, of the gigantic mimosa, and tree-like ferns covered the foreground, while behind, the graceful outlines of the mountains were traced against the sky; and along the coasts swarmed by thousands the precious swallows whose nests furnish a luxurious dish to the tables of the Celestial Empire. The varied landscape afforded by the Andaman Islands was soon passed, however, and the `Rangoon' rapidly approached the Straits of Malacca, which give access to the China seas. </p> 
<p>What was detective Fix, so unluckily drawn on from country to country, doing all this while? He had managed to embark on the `Rangoon' at Calcutta without being seen by Passepartout, after leaving orders that, if the warrant should arrive, it should be forwarded to him at Hong Kong; and he hoped to conceal his presence to the end of the voyage. It would have been difficult to explain why he was on board without awaking Passepartout's suspicions, who thought him still at Bombay. But necessity impelled him, nevertheless, to renew his acquaintance with the worthy servant, as will be seen. </p> 
<p>All the detective's hopes and wishes were now centred on Hong Kong; for the steamer's stay at Singapore would be too brief to enable him to take any steps there. The arrest must be made at Hong Kong, or the robber would probably escape him for ever. Hong Kong was the last English ground on which he would set foot; beyond, China, Japan, America offered to Fogg an almost certain refuge. If the warrant should at last make its appearance at Hong Kong, Fix could arrest him and give him into the hands of the local police, and there would be no further trouble. But beyond Hong Kong, a simple warrant would be of no avail; an extradition warrant would be necessary, and that would result in delays and obstacles, of which the rascal would take advantage to elude justice. </p> 
<p>Fix thought over these probabilities during the long hours which he spent in his cabin, and kept repeating to himself, `Now either the warrant will be at Hong Kong, in which case I shall arrest my man, or it will not be there; and this time it is absolutely necessary that I should delay his departure. I have failed at Bombay, and I have failed at Calcutta: if I fail at Hong Kong, my reputation is lost. Cost what it may, I must succeed! But how shall I prevent his departure, if that should turn out to be my last resource?' </p> 
<p>Fix made up his mind that, if worst came to worst, he would make a confidant of Passepartout, and tell him what kind of a fellow his master really was. That Passepartout was not Fogg's accomplice, he was very certain. The servant, enlightened by his disclosure, and afraid of being himself implicated in the crime, would doubtless become an ally of the detective. But this method was a dangerous one, only to be employed when everything else had failed. A word from Passepartout to his master would ruin all. The detective was therefore in a sore strait. But suddenly a new idea struck him. The presence of Aouda on the `Rangoon', in company with Phileas Fogg, gave him new material for reflection. </p> 
<p>Who was this woman? What combination of events had made her Fogg's travelling companion? They had evidently met somewhere between Bombay and Calcutta; but where? Had they met accidentally, or had Fogg gone into the interior purposely in quest of this charming damsel? Fix was fairly puzzled. He asked himself whether there had not been a wicked elopement; and this idea so impressed itself upon his mind that he determined to make use of the supposed intrigue. Whether the young woman were married or not, he would be able to create such difficulties for Mr Fogg at Hong Kong, that he could not escape by paying any amount of money. </p> 
<p>But could he even wait till they reached Hong Kong? Fogg had an abominable way of jumping from one boat to another, and, before anything could be effected, might get full under weigh again for Yokohama. </p> 
<p>Fix decided that he must warn the English authorities, and Signal the `Rangoon' before her arrival. This was easy to do, since the steamer stopped at Singapore, whence there is a telegraphic wire to Hong Kong. He finally resolved, moreover, before acting more positively, to question Passepartout. It would not be difficult to make him talk; and, as there was no time to lose, Fix prepared to make himself known. </p> 
<p>It was now the 30th of October, and on the following day the `Rangoon' was due at Singapore. </p> 
<p>Fix emerged from his cabin and went on deck. Passepartout was promenading up and down in the forward part of the steamer. The detective rushed forward with every appearance of extreme surprise, and exclaimed, `You here, on the "Rangoon"?' </p> 
<p>`What, Monsieur Fix, are you on board?' returned the really astonished Passepartout, recognizing his crony of the `Mongolia'. `Why, I left you at Bombay, and here you are, on the way to Hong Kong! Are you going round the world too?' </p> 
<p>`No, no,' replied Fix; `I shall stop at Hong Kong - at least for some days.' </p> 
<p>`Hum!' said Passepartout, who seemed for an instant perplexed. `But how is it I have not seen you on board since we left Calcutta?' </p> 
<p>`Oh, a trifle of seasickness, - I've been staying in my berth. The Gulf of Bengal does not agree with me as well as the Indian Ocean. And how is Mr Fogg?' </p> 
<p>`As well and as punctual as ever, not a day behind time! But, Monsieur Fix, you don't know that we have a young lady with us.' </p> 
<p>`A young lady?' replied the detective, not seeming to comprehend what was said. </p> 
<p>Passepartout thereupon recounted Aouda's history, the affair at the Bombay pagoda, the purchase of the elephant for two thousand pounds, the rescue, the arrest and sentence of the Calcutta court, and the restoration of Mr Fogg and himself to liberty on bail. Fix, who was familiar with the last events, seemed to be equally ignorant of all that Passepartout related; and the latter was charmed to find so interested a listener. </p> 
<p>`But does your master propose to carry this young woman to Europe?' </p> 
<p>`Not at all. We are simply going to place her under the protection of one of her relatives, a rich merchant at Hong Kong.' </p> 
<p>`Nothing to be done there,' said Fix to himself, concealing his disappointment. `A glass of gin, Mr Passepartout?' </p> 
<p>`Willingly, Monsieur Fix. We must at least have a friendly glass on board the "Rangoon".' s</p>  
<p>开船后的头几天，艾娥达夫人对于福克先生有了更进一步的了解。她一再对福克先生表示衷心感谢。这位沉默寡言的绅士只听她讲，至少在外表上看来他完全是冷冰冰的，不论在语调和动作上都没有表现出一点激情。福克先生什么都为艾娥达夫人准备得妥妥当当。在一定的时间，他照例到艾娥达夫人的房舱去看望一番，即使他不是去跟她谈天，至少他是在听她讲话。他对艾娥达夫人严格地遵守着一种礼节上的责任，但是在履行这些责任时他总是带着作为一个死板板的绅士所固有的那种关心和令人摸不透的心情，他的一切举止都是用来表现这种心情的。</p> 
<p>艾娥达夫人对这一切简直不知道该怎样去想，但路路通给她谈了一些关于他主人的古怪脾气。他告诉她福克先生为了打什么“赌”才作这次环球旅行的。艾娥达夫人笑了，但无论如何，她是感激从死里救她出来的福克先生的。她根据自己的观察，认为她的救命恩人这次的赌博是不会输的。</p> 
<p>艾娥达夫人证实了帕西向导所叙述的关于她自己的那一段可怕的经历。她也是帕西人，帕西人在印度各族中占着最重要的地位。很多帕西商人在印度作棉花生意发了大财。其中有一位詹姆斯·杰吉荷依爵士曾被英国政府授予贵族称号。这位杰吉荷依富翁跟艾娥达夫人是亲戚，现在住在孟买。艾娥达夫人要到香港去找的那位尊贵的杰吉先生，正是那位杰吉荷依爵士的堂兄弟。但是，她是不是能在杰吉先生那里找到安身之处和得到帮助呢？这一点艾娥达夫人毫无把握。对这件事，福克先生的答复很简单，教她一点也不用发愁，一切都将会按部就班地得到解决，这是他的一句老话。</p> 
<p>这位年轻的女人是不是明白“按部就班地”这个副词的意思，我们不知道。她那两只象喜玛拉雅山圣湖湖水一样清澈的大眼睛，在凝视着福克先生的眼睛。可是这位永远那样规规矩矩冷冷冰冰的绅士，半点也不象是会掉进这湖里去的人。</p> 
<p>仰光号的第一段路程走得非常顺利。风向也利于航行，在这个被海员称为“双臂环抱的孟加拉”辽阔的海湾里，邮船航行一帆风顺。</p> 
<p>不久，仰光号上的旅客已经看见了安达曼群岛的主岛大安达曼岛。岛上美丽的鞍峰山高达两千四百英尺，老远地就为航海家们指出了前进的方向。仰光号从大安达曼岛的海岸近旁驰过。岛上的帕卜阿斯人一个也没出现。他们被人认为是人类中最不开化的民族，但是说他们吃人肉，那是瞎扯的。</p> 
<p>安达曼群岛的风景非常优美。那儿有一望无际的森林遍布全岛的近海一面，其中最多的是：棕树、槟榔树、肉豆蔻、竹子、柏木、大含羞草和桫椤树。森林的后面，是一群俊秀山峦的侧影。海滩上飞翔着成群珍贵的海燕。这种海燕的窝在中国是一种很讲究的名菜——燕窝。</p> 
<p>所有安达曼群岛的美丽的景物，都飞快地从船旁掠过。仰光号迅速地开向马六甲海峡，这条海峡是通向中国领海的门户。</p> 
<p>在这一段航程中，那个被拖着环绕地球的倒霉蛋费克斯在干什么呢？在离开加尔各答时，他先交代好：如果伦敦的拘票一到，马上转寄香港。然后他背着路路通偷偷地上了仰光号。他预备好好地躲藏起来，一直等船到香港时再出来。实际上他也很难向路路通解释清楚他为什么也在这条船上而不会引起对方的怀疑，因为，路路通还以为他现在是在孟买呢。但是为了适应环境改变的需要，他又和这个忠厚的小伙子见面了。他们怎么见面的呢？我们下面来谈。</p> 
<p>侦探费克斯的全部希望和幻想现在只有集中在地球的这一点上，也就是香港。因为邮船在新加坡停留的时间很短，不能在那里解决问题。所以逮捕盗窃犯的活动必须在香港完成，不然，就只有任凭大盗从此逍遥法外了。</p> 
<p>实际上，香港还是一块英国割据的地盆，但是，它也是福克旅途中最后的一块英国地盘了。一过香港，就是中国、日本、美洲，那些地方对福克说来，是更妥当的避难所。如果费克斯到了香港，就能拿到了那跟在他后面寄来的拘票，那么，他就可以把福克抓起来交给当地的警察局。这一切将不费吹灰之力。但是，过了香港，光有一张拘票，就不顶事了，还必须办理引渡手续。办引渡手续就免不了延迟、拖拉和遇到各种阻碍。到那时，这个流氓十拿九稳又会逃之夭夭。所以说，若在香港逮不住他，以后即使不是完全不可能，至少也是很难再找到逮住他的好机会了。</p> 
<p>“对了，”费克斯在自己房舱里苦想了老半天，自言自语地说，“对了，要是拘票已经到了香港，那我就逮住这家伙；要是没寄来，这一回我决定要不借任何代价拖住他，叫他走不成！在孟买我失败了，在加尔各答我也没成功，要是到了香港，再让他滑过去，那我这个侦探的脸就要丢光了！即使拼了这条命，这一回也得拖住他。可是，话又说回来了，要是真需要拖住他的话，那我用什么办法才能让这个该死的福克走不成呢？”</p> 
<p>想到最后，费克斯拿定了主意，先跟路路通打开窗子说亮话，叫他知道他伺候的这位老爷是什么人。他当然不会是福克的同谋。等路路通明自了这件事之后，他一定会害怕被拖下水，到了那个时候，不用说，路路通就会站到他费克斯这一边了。可是，话又说回来了，这到底是一个冒险的办法，这一手儿只能在万不得已的时候才能拿出来。不然，只要路路通在他主人面前走漏半点风声，就会把事情全盘弄糟。</p> 
<p>这个警察厅密探现在感到非常为难。但是，当他看见福克陪着艾娥达夫人在仰光号上散步的时候，他觉得又有一线新的希望。这个女的是什么人？她怎么会跟福克搞在一块儿的？不用说，他们准是在孟买到加尔各答的路上碰见的。可是，到底是在哪儿呢？这个年轻的女人难道会是在旅途中碰巧认识了这位斐利亚·福克吗？从反面来想一想，他这趟穿越印度大陆的旅行，会不会是他预先计划好的，为了要去找这位如花似玉的美人呢？这个女人确实漂亮！费克斯在加尔各答法庭上已经见过她了。</p> 
<p>我们可以想见：这个密探现在是多么伤脑筋啊。他挖空心思地在想，这件事会不会牵连到诱拐妇女的罪行呢？对呀！没错，准是诱拐妇女！费克斯心里认定了这个想法，他发现自己从这件事上能找到很大便宜。不论这个女人是不是有夫之妇，反正是诱拐妇女，因此就有可能在香港给这个得意忘形的骗子制造一些困难，叫他不论拿多少钱出来也不能脱身。</p> 
<p>但是，这事儿不能等仰光号到了香港才动手，因为福克有一种很可恶的习惯：他从一条船上刚跳下来会马上又跳上另一条船。这样他会在你动手之前早就远走高飞了。</p> 
<p>所以最要紧的是要预先通知香港英国当局，并且在他下船之前就监视仰光号的出口。这事儿可是再容易也没有了，因为仰光号要在新加坡停留，新加坡和中国海岸有一条电报线可以联系。</p> 
<p>但是，在动手之前，费克斯为了把事情办得更有把握，他决定先去探探路路通的口气，他知道要想叫这个小伙子打开话匣子那是很容易的。从开船到现在，他一直没在路路通跟前露过面，现在费克斯决定不再躲避他了。时间不能再耽搁了，今天已经是10月30号，仰光号明天就要到新加坡了。</p> 
<p>当天，费克斯就从他的房舱里出来了。他走上了船甲板，故意装作非常惊奇的样子去“主动地”和路路通打招呼。这时路路通正在他面前散步，费克斯从后面赶上去向路路通喊着说：</p> 
<p>“咦！你也在仰光号上！”</p> 
<p>“呃——费克斯先生，您也在这儿！”路路通非常惊奇地回答说，他认出了这位在蒙古号上跟他同船的旅伴。“这是怎么回事？我把您给甩在孟买，怎么在这条去香港的船上又把您给找回来了！难道您也是要环游地球吗？”</p> 
<p>“不，不，”费克斯说，“我打算留在香港，至少要在香港待几天。”</p> 
<p>“奇怪啊！”路路通惊奇地楞了一会儿说，“可是从加尔各答开船到现在，我怎么就没见过您的面儿啊？”</p> 
<p>“说老实话，这几天我不大舒服……有点晕船……我一直在我的房舱里躺着……在印度洋上航行我无所谓，可是在孟加拉湾我就不行了。你的主人福克先生好吗？”</p> 
<p>“他的身体好极了，他还是跟他的行程计划表一样准确，没有拖延过一天！哦，费克斯先生，您还不知道吧，我们现在有了一位年轻的夫人跟我们同路。”</p> 
<p>“一位年轻的夫人？”费克斯说，他对路路通的话装出完全不明白的样子。</p> 
<p>路路通马上就把整个故事的经过都告诉了费克斯。他说了自己在孟买庇拉吉庙怎么闯的祸，又谈了怎么花两千英镑买了一只大象，还讲了怎么在火葬场上劫救了艾娥达夫人以及在加尔各答怎么被判刑和交保释放的事儿。费克斯对于后面这几件事知道得很清楚，但是他假装一点儿也不知道。路路通兴高采烈他讲他的故事，这个听的人看样子也听得津津有味。</p> 
<p>“可是，归根到底，”费克斯说，“您这位主人是不是打算把这位年轻的女人带到欧洲去？”</p> 
<p>“不，费克斯先生，绝不会的。我们只是把她送到香港她的一个亲戚家里。她这个亲戚是香港的一位富商。”</p> 
<p>“这一下可真难办了！”费克斯心里说，他掩饰着自己内心的失望对路路通说：“咱们去喝杯杜松子酒吧，路路通先生？”</p> 
<p>“那太妙了，费克斯先生，咱们能为在仰光号上重见碰杯，这也是个千载难逢的好机会啊！”</p>
