The Pacific railroad is, however, really divided into two distinct lines: the Central Pacific, between San Francisco and Ogden, and the Union Pacific, between Ogden and Omaha. Five main lines connect Omaha with New York. </p> 
<p>New York and San Francisco are thus united by an uninterrupted metal ribbon, which measures no less than three thousand seven hundred and eighty-six miles. Between Omaha and the Pacific the railway crosses a territory which is still infested by Indians and wild beasts, and a large tract which the Mormons, after they were driven from Illinois in 1845, began to colonize. </p> 
<p>The journey from New York to San Francisco consumed, formerly, under the most favourable conditions, at least six months. It is now accomplished in seven days. </p> 
<p>It was in 1862 that, in spite of the Southern Members of Congress, who wished a more southerly route, it was decided to lay the road between the forty-first and forty-second parallels. Ped to have no outlet. The locomotive, its great funnel emitting a weird light, with its sharp bell, and its cow-catcher extended like a spur, mingled its shrieks and bellowings with the noise of torrents and cascades, and twined its smoke among the branches of the gigantic pines. </p> 
<p>There were few or no bridges or tunnels on the route. The railway turned around the sides of the mountains, and did not attempt to violate nature by taking the shortest cut from one pc Railroad is joined by several branches Iowa, Kansas, Colorado and Oregon. On leaving Omaha, it passes along the left bank of the Platte River as far as the junction of its northern branch, follows its southern branch, crosses the Laramie territory and the Wahsatch Mountains, turns the Great Salt Lake, and reaches Salt Lake City, the Mormon capital, plunges into the Tuilla Valley, across the American Desert, Cedar and Humboldt Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, and descends, via Sacramento, to the Pacific - its grade, even on the Rocky Mountains, never exceeding one hundred and twelve feet to the mile. </p> 
<p>Such was the road to be traversed in seven days, which would enable Phileas Fogg - at least, so he hoped - to take the Atlantic steamer at New York on the 11th for Liverpool. </p> 
<p>The car which he occupied was a sort of long omnibus on eight wheels, and with no compartments in the interior. It was supplied with two rows of seats, perpendicular to the direction of the train on either side of an aisle which conducted to the front and rear platforms. These platforms were found throughout the train, and the passengers were able to pass from one end of the train to the other. It was supplied with saloon cars, balcony cars, restaurants and smoking cars; theatre cars alone were wanting, and they will have these some day. </p> 
<p>Book and news dealers, sellers of edibles, drinkables, and cigars, who seemed to have plenty of customers, were continually circulating in the aisles. </p> 
<p>The train left Oakland station at six o'clock. It was already night, cold and cheerless, the heavens being overcast with clouds which seemed to threaten snow. The train did not proceed rapidly; counting the stoppages, it did not run more than twenty miles an hour, which was a sufficient speed, however, to enable it to reach Omaha within its designated time. </p> 
<p>There was but little conversation in the car, and soon many of the passengers were overcome with sleep. Passepartout found himself beside the detective; but he did not talk to him. After recent events, their relations with each other had grown somewhat cold; there could no longer be mutual sympathy or intimacy between them. Fix's manner had not changed; but Passepartout was very reserved, and ready to strangle his former friend on the slightest provocation. </p> 
<p>Snow began to fall an hour after they started, a fine snow, however, which happily could not obstruct the train; nothing could be seen from the windows but a vast, white sheet, against which the smoke of the locomotive had a grayish aspect. </p> 
<p>At eight o'clock a steward entered the car and announced that the time for going to bed had arrived; and in a few minutes the car was transformed into a dormitory. The backs of the seats were thrown back, bedsteads carefully packed were rolled out by an ingenious system, berths were suddenly improvised, and each traveller had soon at his disposition a comfortable bed, protected from curious eyes by thick curtains. The sheets were clean and the pillows soft. It only remained to go to bed and sleep - which everybody did - while the train sped on across the State of California. </p> 
<p>The country between San Francisco and Sacramento is not very hilly. The Central Pacific, taking Sacramento for its starting-point, extends eastwards to meet the road from Omaha. The line from San Francisco to Sacramento runs in a north-easterly direction, along the American River, which empties into San Pablo Bay. The one hundred and twenty miles between these cities were accomplished in six hours, and towards midnight, while fast asleep, the travellers passed through Sacramento; so that they saw nothing of that important place, the seat of the State government, with its fine quays, its broad streets, its noble hotels, squares and churches. </p> 
<p>The train, on leaving Sacramento, and passing the junction, Roclin, Auburn, and Colfax, entered the range of the Sierra Nevada. Cisco was reached at seven in the morning; and an hour later the dormitory was transformed into an ordinary car, and the travellers could observe the picturesque beauties of the mountain region through which they were steaming. The railway track wound in and out among the passes, now approaching the mountain sides, now suspended over precipices, avoiding abrupt angles by bold curves, plunging into narrow defiles, which seemed to have no outlet. The locomotive, its great funnel emitting a weird light, with its sharp bell, and its cow-catcher extended like a spur, mingled its shrieks and bellowings with the noise of torrents and cascades, and twined its smoke among the branches of the gigantic pines. </p> 
<p>There were few or no bridges or tunnels on the route. The railway turned around the sides of the mountains, and did not attempt to violate nature by taking the shortest cut from one point to another. </p> 
<p>The train entered the State of Nevada through the Carson valley about nine o'clock, going always north-easterly; and at midday reached Reno, where there was a delay of twenty minutes for breakfast. </p> 
<p>From this point the road, running along Humboldt River, passed northward for several miles by its banks; then it turned eastward, and kept by the river until it reached the Humboldt Range, nearly at the extreme eastern limit of Nevada. </p> 
<p>Having breakfasted, Mr Fogg and his companions resumed their places in the car, and observed the varied landscape which unfolded itself as they passed along; the vast prairies, the mountains lining the horizon, and the creeks with their frothy, foaming streams. Sometimes a great herd of buffaloes, massing together in the distance, seemed like a movable dam. These innumerable multitudes of ruminating beasts often form an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the trains; thousands of them have been seen passing over the track for hours together, in compact ranks. The locomotive is then forced to stop and wait till the road is once more clear. </p> 
<p>This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr Fogg was travelling. About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to clear the way with its cow-catcher; but the mass of animals was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain. </p> 
<p>The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should please the buffaloes to get out of the way. </p> 
<p>Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them. </p> 
<p>`What a country!' cried he. `Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if they were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!' </p> 
<p>The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was wise. He would have crushed the first buffaloes, no doubt, with the cow-catcher; but the locomotive, however powerful, would soon have been checked, the train would inevitably have been thrown off the track, and would then have been helpless. </p> 
<p>The best course was to wait patiently, and regain the lost time by greater speed when the obstacle was removed. The procession of buffaloes lasted three full hours, and it was night before the track was clear. The last ranks of the herd were now passing over the rails, while the first had already disappeared below the southern horizon. </p> 
<p>It was eight o'clock when the train passed through the defiles of the Humboldt Range, and half-past nine when it penetrated Utah, the region of the Great Salt Lake, the singular colony of the Mormons. </p>  
<p>所以目前从旧金山到纽约，是由一条至少有三千七百八十六英里长的完整的铁路线连结起来的。</p> 
<p>从奥马哈到太平洋海岸，铁路要穿过一片至今还经常有印第安人和野兽出没的地区，1845年左右，摩门教徒被赶出伊利诺斯州以后，就开始在这里建立了定居点。</p> 
<p>过去即使在最顺利的情况下，从纽约到旧金山也要走六个月，而现在只需要七天时间。</p> 
<p>1862年，尽管有南方的议员反对，结果还是选定了在北纬四十一度和四十二度之间的地区修了这条铁路，而南方议员则要求铁路建筑得更靠南部一些。当时是那位令人永远怀念的林肯总统亲自选定了内布拉斯加州的奥马哈城作为这个新铁路网的起点。铁路工程立即以美国人那种实干的精神动工了，这种精神就是既没有文牍主义，又没有官僚主义。工人们高速度的施工一点也没有影响铁路的质量。在草原地区，前进的速度每天竟达一英里半。机车就在头一天铺起的路轨上运来了第二天需用的钢轨，就这样沿着一节节陆续铺成的新轨不停地前进。</p> 
<p>太平洋铁路沿途附设了很多支线。这些支线穿过衣阿华、堪萨斯、科罗拉多、俄勒冈等州。铁路从奥马哈向西伸展，沿着普拉特河北岸，直到普拉特河北部支流的入口处向西南延伸，继续顺着这条河的南部支流前进，它穿过拉拉岷地区和瓦萨乞山丛，绕着大咸湖到达摩尔蒙的首府咸湖城，从咸湖城进入颓拉山谷，沿着美洲大沙漠，经过赛达和亨堡尔特山区，跨过亨堡尔特河和西爱拉——内华达河，向南经萨克拉门托直到太平洋岸。这一条大铁路上下的坡度很小。即使在穿过落矾山脉的时候，每英里路的坡度也没超过一百十二英尺。</p> 
<p>这就是需要火车七日行程才能走完的这条大铁路，正是因为有了这条大铁路，斐利亚·福克先生才有可能，至少他才敢希望在12月11日从纽约搭船到英国利物浦。</p> 
<p>斐利亚·福克坐的车厢是一种加长的车厢。这一节客车的底盘是由两节各有四个车轮的车架联结成的。这样的装置使列车能在转弯角度较小的路线上，顺利前进。车厢内部根本没有分隔起来的旅客房间，只是从正中间分隔开，整齐地排着两行靠背椅。中间是一条过道，可以通向盥洗室和其他车厢。这些设备在每一节客车都是一样。一节车厢与另一节车厢之间有车桥相互联结。整个列车前后贯通，旅客可以从第一节车走到最后一节车。列车上附设有：客厅、眺望车、餐车、喝咖啡车，就是没有观剧车，不过这在将来还是会有的。</p> 
<p>车厢里的过道上有小贩来往出卖书报、酒类、食品和雪茄烟，生意颇为兴隆。</p> 
<p>晚上六点钟，火车载着旅客从奥克兰出发。这时天已黑了，寒冷和黑暗笼罩着大地，天空乌云密布，看样子将要下雪。火车前进的速度并不很快，如果连站上停留的时间计算在内，每小时速度不超过二十英里。但是就这样的速度，已经能够保证列车在规定时间内横贯美国大陆。</p> 
<p>车厢里，旅客们很少交谈，大家很快地都打起盹来了。路路通坐在密探费克斯旁边，但是他不跟费克斯说话。自从那次交手和谈判之后。他们的关系已经大为疏远了。过去的友好亲善，今日已烟消云散。其实费克斯一点也没有改变对路路通的态度；可是路路通却完全不同，他一直保持着高度的警惕，只要这位老兄有一点可疑的行动，他就准备立刻掐死他。</p> 
<p>火车出站之后一小时，天上就飘起雪花来了。幸运的是这样的小雪并不会阻碍火车前进。车窗外面只是一片白雪，茫无边际，机车喷出灰色烟雾在雪野里上下盘旋飞舞。</p> 
<p>八点钟，一个列车员走进车厢，通知旅客睡觉的时候到了。原来这个车厢也同时是一节卧车。不一会儿，车厢已经改装成了宿舍。人们把坐椅的靠背放平，巧妙地搭成了一个个非常舒适的卧铺，同时分隔成了一间间的小房间。每个旅客马上都有了自己舒适的床位。厚布的帷幔挡住了一切漫不经心的视线。雪白的被单铺好了，柔软的枕头放好了，只等躺下睡觉了。每一个旅客在这里都象是在邮船上舒服的房舱里。这时，火车正以全速在加利福尼亚州的土地上飞驰。</p> 
<p>现在火车正经过旧金山和萨克拉门托之间的地区。这里，地势并不十分险峻。这一段叫中央太平洋铁路，火车以萨克拉门托为起点，向东方前进和奥马哈开出的火车在中途错车。从旧金山到加利福尼亚州的首府，火车沿着流入圣巴布洛湾的美洲河直奔东北，这一段联系着两座大城市的铁路约有一百二十英里，六小时就可以走完。午夜十二时，火车驰过萨克拉门托，车上旅客这时初入梦境不久。所以他们一点也没看见这座巨大的城市——加利福尼亚州的立法议会所在地，他们既没看见这个城市的美丽车站和码头，也没看见它那宽阔的大街和豪华的旅馆，更没看见那些教堂和街心公园。</p> 
<p>火车从萨克拉门托继续前进，经过江克欣、洛克林、奥本和科尔法克斯等站，进入了西埃拉——内华达山区。上午七点钟火车开过了西斯科。一小时之后，车上的卧铺又变成了普通的坐椅。旅客们可以透过玻璃窗尽情阅览这山区的美景。这里的铁路线是顺着西埃拉山脉崎岖的山势铺设的。它忽而贴在山腰，忽而在悬崖上前进，有时为了避免急转弯，它的曲度大得惊人，有时伸入两山对峙的狭谷里，使人颇有“山穷无路”之感。那火车头看来黑里透光，象是一具灵柩，顶上一盏照明灯射出雪亮刺眼的光芒，此外还附装着一个银色的警钟和一具象猪嘴似的伸在车头前的“驱牛”排障器。这时，在汽笛怒吼和瀑布奔流的共鸣声中，只见火车吐出的黑烟在漆黑的松林上空缭绕飞舞。</p> 
<p>在这一段路上几乎可以说没有山洞，也没有桥梁。铁路盘着山腰前进，从这座山到那座山，铁路完全是顺着自然地势铺设的，毫不寻求捷径和直路。</p> 
<p>将近九点钟的时候，火车从卡尔松山谷进入了内华达州，继续向东北奔驰。火车在雷诺停了二十分钟，旅客们吃了午饭，十二时正，又从雷诺出发。</p> 
<p>铁路线沿着亨堡尔特河从这里北上，一直要走好几英里：然后又转向东进，一直到亨博尔特山脉，始终不离开这条河的河岸。位于内华达州东部边缘的亨博尔特山脉，是亨博尔特河的发源地。</p> 
<p>饭后，福克先生、艾娥达夫人和他们的两个旅伴重新回到车厢，舒舒服服地分坐在两张双人椅上，他们欣赏着从眼前掠过的千变万化的景物：广阔无边的草原，浮现在天边的群山和滚滚流动的小河。有时可以看到一大群野牛在远处排成大队，它们简直象是一座活动的堤防，这一支由无数反刍动物组成的大军，经常在铁路上给来往火车造成无法克服的障碍。人们曾经看见过成千上万的野牛一队紧接着一队穿过铁路，往往一过就得好几个钟头，这时火车只好停下来，等野牛过完了才能继续前进。</p> 
<p>今天正好就遇上了这种事。下午快三点钟的时候，约有一万两三千头野牛，拦住了前面的路轨，机车放慢了速度，想用车头前面的排障器冲入牛群强行通过，但是，没有成功，火车只好在这个攻不进的牛群前停了下来。</p> 
<p>人们只好眼看着这些被美国人错误地叫做“水牛”的反刍野兽不慌不忙地穿过铁路。它们一边走一边时而发出惊人的吼声。这些野牛比欧洲的牡牛大，腿和尾巴都很短，前肩高耸形成一个肉峰，两角分开向下弯曲，头颈和双肩都满了长鬃毛。这种牛群的移动是无法阻拦的。当它们朝着某一个方向前进的时候，谁也不能叫它们停止或者改变方狗。它们简直是活肉形成的河流，任何堤防也挡不住。</p> 
<p>旅客们都跑到车桥上看这个奇怪的场面去了。但是斐利亚·福克，这位本来应该比别人更着急的绅士却依然稳坐不动，用哲学家那种“以不变应万变”的精神等待野牛让路。而路路通却对这一大群野兽拦住火车白白耗费时间，感到异常愤怒。他简直想把他所有的几支手枪都拿出来向这群畜牲狠狠地射击一顿、</p> 
<p>“这种鬼地方！”路路通叫着说，“一群死牛就能把火车给拦住！成群结队地过铁路，一点也不着急，好象它们一点不妨碍交通似的。天晓得！我现在倒很想知道福克先生对这件意外的事是不是也预先定在他的计划里了。还有这个火车司机，他居然不敢开车从这群拦路的野牛中冲过去！”</p> 
<p>司机确实是一点也没打算冲破面前的障碍，他这样谨慎是对的。他如果冲过去的话，毫无疑问那几头首当其中的野牛一定会被机车排障器压碎，但是，不管机车多么有力，它也会很快地被迫停车，少不了还会出轨，结果那就要真的抛锚了。</p> 
<p>所以最好的办法就是耐心地等待，完事之后再加快速度来补偿耽搁了的时间。野牛的队伍，足足过了三个小时，直到天黑，铁路才给让出来。在最后一批牛群跨过铁路的时候，它们的先头部队则已经在南方地平线上消失了。</p> 
<p>当火车驰过亨博尔特山脉的狭窄山道的时候，已经是晚上八点钟了。九点半钟，火车进入了犹他州。这里是大咸湖区域，是摩门教徒的世外桃源。</p>
