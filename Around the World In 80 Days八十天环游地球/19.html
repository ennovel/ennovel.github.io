The island is situated at the mouth of the Canton River, and is separated by about sixty miles from the Portuguese town of Macao, on the opposite coast. Hong Kong has beaten Macao in the struggle for the Chinese trade, and now the greater part of the transportation of Chinese goods finds its depot at the former place. Docks, hospitals, wharves, a Gothic cathedral, a government house, macadamized streets give to Hong Kong the appearance of a town in Kent or Surrey transferred by some strange magic to the antipodes. </p> 
<p>Passepartout wandered, with his hands in his pockets, towards the Victoria port, gazing as he went at the curious palanquins and other modes of conveyance, and the groups of Chinese, Japanese and Europeans who passed to and fro in the streets. Hong Kong seemed to him not unlike Bombay, Calcutta and Singapore, since, like them, it betrayed everywhere the evidence of English supremacy. At the Victoria port he found a confused mass of ships of all nations: English, French, American and Dutch, men-of-war and trading vessels, Japanese and Chinese junks, sempas, tankas and flower-boats, which formed so many floating parterres. Passepartout noticed in the crowd a number of the natives who seemed very old and were dressed in yellow. On going into a barber's to get shaved he learned that these ancient men were all at least eighty years old, at which age they are permitted to wear yellow, which is the Imperial colour. Passepartout, without exactly knowing why, thought this very funny. </p> 
<p>On reaching the quay where they were to embark on the `Carnatic', he was not astonished to find Fix walking up and down. The detective seemed very much disturbed and disappointed. </p> 
<p>`This is bad,' muttered Passepartout, `for the gentlemen of the Reform Club!' He accosted Fix with a merry smile, as if he had not perceived that gentleman's chagrin. The detective had, indeed, good reasons to inveigh against the bad luck which pursued him. The warrant had not come! It was certainly on the way, but as certainly it could not now reach Hong Kong for several days; and this being the last English territory on Mr Fogg's route, the robber would escape, unless he could manage to detain him. </p> 
<p>`Well, Monsieur Fix,' said Passepartout, `have you decided to go on with us as far as America?' </p> 
<p>`Yes,' returned Fix, through his set teeth. `Good!' exclaimed Passepartout, laughing heartily. `I knew you could not persuade yourself to separate from us. Come and engage your berth.' </p> 
<p>They entered the steamer office and secured cabins for four persons. The clerk, as he gave them the tickets, informed them that, the repairs on the `Carnatic' having been completed, the steamer would leave that very evening, and not next morning as had been announced. </p> 
<p>`That will suit my master all the better,' said Passepartout. `I will go and let him know.' </p> 
<p>Fix now decided to make a bold move; he resolved to tell Passepartout all. It seemed to be the only possible means of keeping Phileas Fogg several days longer at Hong Kong. He accordingly invited his companion into a tavern which caught his eye on the quay. On entering, they found themselves in a large room handsomely decorated, at the end of which was a large campbed furnished with cushions. Several persons lay upon this bed in a deep sleep. At the same tables which were arranged about the room some thirty customers were drinking English beer, porter, gin and brandy; smoking, the while, long red clay pipes stuffed with little balls of opium mingled with essence of rose. From time to time one of the smokers, overcome with the narcotic, would slip under the table, whereupon the waiters, taking him by the head and feet, carried and laid him upon the bed. The bed already supported twenty of these stupefied sots. </p> 
<p>Fix and Passepartout saw that they were in a smoking-house haunted by those wretched, cadaverous, idiotic creatures, to whom the English merchants sell every year the miserable drug called opium, to the amount of one million four hundred thousand pounds - thousands devoted to one of the most despicable vices which afflict humanity! The Chinese government has in vain attempted to deal with the evil by stringent laws. It passed gradually from the rich, to whom it was at first exclusively reserved, to the lower classes, and then its ravages could not be arrested. Opium is smoked everywhere, at all times, by men and women, in the Celestial Empire; and, once accustomed to it, the victims cannot dispense with it, except by suffering horrible bodily contortions and agonies. A great smoker can smoke as many as eight pipes a day; but he dies in five years. It was in one of these dens that Fix and Passepartout, in search of a friendly glass, found themselves. Passepartout had no money, but willingly accepted Fix's invitation in the hope of returning the obligation at some future time. </p> 
<p>They ordered two bottles of port, to which the Frenchman did ample justice, whilst Fix observed him with close attention. They chatted about the journey, and Passepartout was especially merry at the idea that Fix was going to continue it with them. When the bottles were empty, however, he rose to go and tell his master of the change in the time of the sailing of the `Carnatic'. </p> 
<p>Fix caught him by the arm, and said, `Wait a moment.' </p> 
<p>`What for, Mr Fix?' </p> 
<p>`I want to have a serious talk with you.' </p> 
<p>`A serious talk!' cried Passepartout, drinking up the little wine that was left in the bottom of his glass. `Well, we'll talk about it to-morrow; I haven't time now.' </p> 
<p>`Stay! What I have to say concerns your master.' </p> 
<p>Passepartout, at this, looked attentively at his companion. Fix's face seemed to have a singular expression. He resumed his seat. </p> 
<p>`What is it that you have to say?' </p> 
<p>Fix placed his hand upon Passepartout's arm, and, lowering his voice, said, `You have guessed who I am?' </p> 
<p>`Parbleu!' said Passepartout, smiling. `Then I'm going to tell you everything--' </p> 
<p>`Now that I know everything, my friend! Ah! that's very good. But go on, go on. First, though, let me tell you that those gentlemen have put themselves to a useless expense.' </p> 
<p>`Useless!' said Fix. `You speak confidently. It's clear that you don't know how large the sum is.' </p> 
<p>`Of course I do,' returned Passepartout. `Twenty thousand pounds.' </p> 
<p>`Fifty-five thousand!' answered Fix, pressing his companion's hand. </p> 
<p>`What!' cried the Frenchman. `Has Monsieur Fogg dared - fifty-five thousand pounds! Well, there's all the more reason for not losing an instant,' he continued, getting up hastily. </p> 
<p>Fix pushed Passepartout back in his chair, and resumed: `Fifty-five thousand pounds; and if I succeed, I get two thousand pounds. If you'll help me, I'll let you have five hundred of them.' </p> 
<p>`Help you?' cried Passepartout, whose eyes were standing wide open. </p> 
<p>`Yes; help me keep Mr Fogg here for two or three days.' </p> 
<p>`Why, what are you saying? Those gentlemen are not satisfied with following my master and suspecting his honour, but they must try to put obstacles in his way! I blush for them!' </p> 
<p>`What do you mean?' </p> 
<p>`I mean that it is a piece of shameful trickery. They might as well waylay Mr Fogg and put his money in their pockets!' </p> 
<p>`That's just what we count on doing.' </p> 
<p>`It's a conspiracy, then,' cried Passepartout, who became more and more excited as the liquor mounted in his head, for he drank without perceiving it. `A real conspiracy! And gentlemen, too. Bah!' </p> 
<p>Fix began to be puzzled. </p> 
<p>`Members of the Reform Club!' continued Passepartout. `You must know, Monsieur Fix, that my master is an honest man, and that, when he makes a wager, he tries to win it fairly!' </p> 
<p>`But who do you think I am?' asked Fix, looking at him intently. </p> 
<p>`Parbleu! An agent of the members of the Reform Club, sent out here to interrupt my master's journey. But, though I found you out some time ago, I've taken good care to say nothing about it to Mr Fogg.' </p> 
<p>`He knows nothing, then?' </p> 
<p>`Nothing,' replied Passepartout, again emptying his glass. </p> 
<p>The detective passed his hand across his forehead, hesitating before he spoke again. What should he do? Passepartout's mistake seemed sincere, but it made his design more difficult. It was evident that the servant was not the master's accomplice, as Fix had been inclined to suspect. </p> 
<p>`Well,' said the detective to himself, `as he is not an accomplice, he will help me.' </p> 
<p>He had no time to lose: Fogg must be detained at Hong Kong, so he resolved to make a clean breast of it. </p> 
<p>`Listen to me,' said Fix abruptly. `I am not, as you think, an agent of the members of the Reform Club--' </p> 
<p>`Bah!' retorted Passepartout, with an air of raillery. </p> 
<p>`I am a police detective, sent out here by the London office.' </p> 
<p>`You, a detective?' </p> 
<p>`I will prove it. Here is my commission.' </p> 
<p>Passepartout was speechless with astonishment when Fix displayed this document, the genuineness of which could not be doubted. </p> 
<p>`Mr Fogg's wager,' resumed Fix, `is only a pretext, of which you and the gentlemen of the Reform are dupes. He had a motive for securing your innocent complicity.' </p> 
<p>`But why?' </p> 
<p>`Listen. On the 28th of last September a robbery of fifty-five thousand pounds was committed at the Bank of England by a person whose description was fortunately secured. Here is this description; it answers exactly to that of Mr Phileas Fogg.' </p> 
<p>`What nonsense!' cried Passepartout, striking the table with his fist. `My master is the most honourable of men!' </p> 
<p>`How can you tell? You know scarcely anything about him. You went into his service the day he came away; and he came away on a foolish pretext, without trunks, and carrying a large amount in bank-notes. And yet you are bold enough to assert that he is an honest man!' </p> 
<p>`Yes, yes,' repeated the poor fellow, mechanically. `Would you like to be arrested as his accomplice?' Passepartout, overcome by what he had heard, held his head between his hands, and did not dare to look at the detective. Phileas Fogg, the saviour of Aouda, that brave and generous man, a robber! And yet how many presumptions there were against him! Passepartout essayed to reject the suspicions which forced themselves upon his mind; he did not wish to believe that his master was guilty. </p> 
<p>`Well, what do you want of me?' said he, at last, with an effort. </p> 
<p>`See here,' replied Fix; `I have tracked Mr Fogg to this place, but as yet I have failed to receive the warrant of arrest for which I sent to London. You must help me to keep him here in Hong Kong--' </p> 
<p>`I! But I--' </p> 
<p>`I will share with you the two thousand pounds reward offered by the Bank of England.' </p> 
<p>`Never!' replied Passepartout, who tried to rise, but fell back, exhausted in mind and body. </p> 
<p>`Mr Fix,' he stammered; `even should what you say be true - if my master is really the robber you are seeking for - which I deny - I have been, am, in his service; I have seen his generosity and goodness; and I will never betray him - not for all the gold in the world. I come from a village where they don't eat that kind of bread!' </p> 
<p>`You refuse?' </p> 
<p>`I refuse.' </p> 
<p>`Consider that I've said nothing,' said Fix; `and let us drink.' </p> 
<p>`Yes; let us drink!' </p> 
<p>Passepartout felt himself yielding more and more to the effects of the liquor. Fix, seeing that he must, at all hazards, be separated from his master, wished to entirely overcome him. Some pipes full of opium lay upon the table. Fix slipped one into Passepartout's hand. He took it put it between his lips, lit it, drew several puffs, and his head, becoming heavy under the influence of the narcotic, fell upon the table. </p> 
<p>`At last!' said Fix, seeing Passepartout unconscious. `Mr Fogg will not be informed of the "Carnatic's" departure; and, if he is, he will have to go without this cursed Frenchman!' </p> 
<p>And, after paying his bill, Fix left the tavern. </p>  
<p>路路通两手插在衣袋里一面走向维多利亚港，一面欣赏着那些在中国还十分流行的轿子和带篷的轿车。成群的中国人、日本人和欧洲人在街上熙熙攘攘非常忙碌。路路通觉得这个城市和他沿途经过的孟买、加尔各答或新加坡等城市差不多没有什么两样。这些地方都好象是环绕着地球排成的一条英国城市的索链。</p> 
<p>路路通到了珠江口上的维多利亚港，这里聚集着各国的船只：英国的、法国的、美国的、荷兰的，其中有军舰，有商船，有日本的或是中国的小船，有大帆船、汽艇和舢板，甚至还有“花船”，这些“花船”就象是漂浮在水面上的花坛。路路通在路上还看见一些穿黄色衣服的本地人，这些人年纪都很大。路路通想按中国习惯刮一次脸，就走进了一家中国理发店，他从一位英语讲得相当好的理发师那里才知道刚才看见的那些老人年纪最小的也都在八十岁以上，他们只有到这样高龄，才有权利穿黄衣服，因为黄色是代表皇家的颜色。路路通虽然不了解究竟，不过他觉得这倒挺滑稽。</p> 
<p>他刮好了脸就走向卡尔纳蒂克停靠的码头。到了那儿，他看见费克斯正独自在河边上徘徊，这路路通一点也不奇怪。这时，这位侦探脸上露着十分失望的表情。</p> 
<p>“好！”路路通心里说，“这一来对改良俱乐部那些老爷们可就不大妙了！”</p> 
<p>他对费克斯的烦恼装着完全没有看见的样子，笑嘻嘻地走上去跟他打了招呼。</p> 
<p>说实在话，一点也不能怪费克斯咒骂他一再碰上的坏运气。还是没有拘票！显然这份拘票还正在他后面追着转寄，要是能在香港再待上几天，就准会收到了。既然香港是这次旅途上最后一个受英国管辖的地方，要是在此地不能逮捕福克，那么这个贼就一定会远走高飞了。</p> 
<p>“嘿，费克斯先生，您是决定跟我们一同到美洲去了？”路路通问。</p> 
<p>“是啊。”费克斯咬着牙说。</p> 
<p>“那就快走吧，”路路通一面说着一面哈哈大笑。“我早知道您是不会跟我们分手的。好吧，咱们一齐去订船票吧！”</p> 
<p>他们一同走进了海运售票处，订了四个舱位。这时售票员告诉他们说，卡尔纳蒂克号已经修好了，原来规定明天早晨开船，现在提前了，今天晚上八点钟就开。</p> 
<p>“那好极了，”路路通说，“提早开船对于我的主人更合适，我就去告诉他。”</p> 
<p>现在费克斯决定采取最后一着了。他决定把一切都告诉路路通。要拖住斐利亚·福克在香港多待几天，也许这是唯一的一个办法了。离开售票处以后，费克斯就请路路通到酒店去喝两杯。路路通看时候还早，也就接受了他的邀请。</p> 
<p>码头对面就有一家外表很吸引人的酒店。他们两个便走了进去。这是一间装修得很漂亮的大厅。靠里边放着一张板床，上面铺着垫子。床上一个挨一个地睡了好些人。在这大厅里，有三十多个人散坐在那些用藤条编的桌子上。他们有的在大杯地喝着清淡的或浓烈的英国啤酒，有的在喝着英国烧酒：杜松子酒或白兰地。另外，大部分人都在吸着长杆红瓦头的大烟枪，大烟斗上装着玫瑰露合鸦片制成的烟泡。不断有吸烟的人晕过去，倒在桌子底下，于是酒店的伙计就过去拖住他的脚和脖子把他搬到板床上和那些已经晕过去的烟鬼放在一起。晕过去的烟鬼就这样被一个一个地排着放在板床上，共有二十多个，他们那种狼狈不堪的样子真是使人恶心。</p> 
<p>费克斯和路路通现在才知道他们是进了一家专做这些无赖汉、白痴、荒唐鬼、糊涂虫生意的大烟馆。这个死要钱的大英帝国每年要卖给这些人价值两亿六千万法郎的这种害死人的所谓“鸦片”药膏！利用人类最悲惨的恶习赚来的这笔钱是多么污秽呵！</p> 
<p>中国政府曾经想用严厉的法律来禁绝这种恶习，但是没有成效。吸鸦片的恶习从富有阶级——鸦片首先是专给他们享用的——一直蔓延到了下层阶级，这种灾祸就再也无法禁止了。目前在中华帝国吸鸦片的人随时随地都有。男人女人都贪恋这种可悲的嗜好。他们一旦吸上了瘾，就再也戒不掉了，否则就会产生剧烈的胃疼。烟瘾大的人一天能吸八筒，这种人过不了五年就得死。象这样的大烟馆香港很多，费克斯和路路通怀着喝两杯的念头走进的这个地方不过是其中之一罢了。</p> 
<p>路路通没有钱，但是他很乐意接受了他朋友的这番“美意”。他提出改一天要回请费克斯。</p> 
<p>他们要了两瓶有名的葡萄牙红酒，这个小伙子便开怀畅饮起来。但是费克斯却喝得很有分寸，他在注意观察路路通。他们天南地北地聊起来了。谈得特别起劲的是关于费克斯决定搭乘卡尔纳蒂克号船去横滨的这个好主意。当他们谈到这一条船要提早几小时动身的时候路路通把酒喝光了站了起来，要回去通知他的主人提早上船。这时费克斯一把把他拖住。</p> 
<p>“你等一会儿。”费克斯说。</p> 
<p>“您要怎么样，费克斯先生？”</p> 
<p>“我有件要紧的事要跟你谈谈。”</p> 
<p>“要紧的事儿？”路路通大声说，同时把酒杯里剩下的几滴酒喝干了。“好吧，咱们明天再谈，我今天没时间。”</p> 
<p>“别走！”费克斯说，“关于你主人的事。”</p> 
<p>路路通听了这句话就注意望着费克斯。他发现费克斯的面部表情非常奇怪。于是他就又坐下来。</p> 
<p>“你到底要跟我说什么？”路路通说。</p> 
<p>费克斯一只手放在路路通的手臂上，低声地说：</p> 
<p>“你已经猜出来我是什么人了吗？”费克斯问。</p> 
<p>“这还用说！”路路通笑着说。</p> 
<p>“好吧，那我现在把全部情况都告诉你。”</p> 
<p>“现在，我已经全部都知道了，老兄！喏，这没什么，好吧，你讲下去吧，不过先让我说一句，那些老爷们把钱给白花了。”</p> 
<p>“把钱白花了！”费克斯说，“你别跟我瞎扯了，我一看就知道你根本不了解这件事关系到多大一笔数目呵！”</p> 
<p>“你错了，我知道，”路路通说，“两万英镑！”</p> 
<p>“不是两万！”费克斯抓紧路路通的手说，“是五万五千英镑！”</p> 
<p>“怎么着？”路路通叫着说，“福克先生他居然敢拿……五万五千英镑……好吧，这就更不能耽误时候了。”说到这里他又站起来了。</p> 
<p>“五万五千英镑！”费克斯一面强拉着路路通又坐下来，又叫了一瓶白兰地，一面接着说，“要是我这事办成了，我会得到两千英镑奖金。只要你肯帮忙，我分给你五百英镑（一万二千五百法郎），干不干？”</p> 
<p>“要我帮你的忙？”路路通大声说，他的两只眼晴简直都瞪圆了。</p> 
<p>“对了，你帮我拖住福克先生在香港多待几天！”</p> 
<p>“嘻！”路路通说，“你这说的什么话呵？这些老爷们不拿我的主人当正人君子看，叫你来盯他的梢，这还不够，还要千方百计阻扰人家，我真替他们难为情。”</p> 
<p>“噢，你这话是什么意思呢？”</p> 
<p>“我说这简直太不漂亮啦！这简直是要把福克先生口袋里的钱都挖出来，等于是要夺去他的全部财产！”</p> 
<p>“对呵，咱们就是要打算这么干。”</p> 
<p>“可是这是个阴谋！”路路通嚷着说。费克斯敬他一杯他就喝一杯，根本没注意自己喝了多少，现在白兰地酒劲一冲，气可就更大了。“这是不折不扣的阴谋！这些老爷们，还是朋友呢？”</p> 
<p>费克斯开始觉得他的话文不对题了。</p> 
<p>“朋友？”路路通嚷着说，“还都是改良俱乐部的会员呢，费克斯先生，您要知道，我的主人是一个正派人，他这个人只要说跟人家打赌，他就是规规矩矩地去赢人家。”</p> 
<p>“你等一下，你到底以为我是什么人？”费克斯两只眼睛直盯着路路通说。</p> 
<p>“这还用说？你是改良俱乐部那些老爷们派来的暗探，你的任务是要监视我主人沿途旅行的情况，这简直太不体面了！我虽然早已经看出了你的身分，可是我一直一个字儿也没有对福克先生说过。”</p> 
<p>“他一点也不知道？”费克斯激动地问。</p> 
<p>“他半点儿都不知道。”路路通说着又干了一杯。</p> 
<p>密探用手摸着自己的前额。在他接着谈下去之前，他感到非常犹豫。他该怎么办呢？路路通的误会看起来绝不是装的，不过这就使费克斯的计划更难完成了。这个小伙子讲的完完全全是老实话，这是很明显的。他也绝对不会是福克的同谋，这一点本来是费克斯最担心的。这时，费克斯心里说：“既然他不是福克的同谋，他就一定会帮助我。”</p> 
<p>密探又重新拿定了主意。何况时间也不容许他再拖延下去了。无论如何必须在香港把福克逮起来。于是他就直截了当地对路路通说：</p> 
<p>“你听我说，你注意听着。我不是你所猜想的那种人。我不是改良俱乐部那些会员派来的暗探……”</p> 
<p>“噢！”路路通滑稽地看着费克斯说。</p> 
<p>“我是警察厅的侦探，接受了伦敦警察当局的任务……”</p> 
<p>“您……警察厅的侦探……”</p> 
<p>“对了，我给你看证件，”费克斯说，“喏，这是我的出差证明书。”</p> 
<p>侦探从他的皮夹里拿出一张证件给路路通看，那是伦敦警察总局局长签署的公差证明书。路路通给吓傻了。两眼直瞪着费克斯，一句话也说不上来了。这时费克斯就接着说：</p> 
<p>“福克先生说打赌，这不过是个借口。你和那些改良俱乐部的会员都是被他这个花招儿给骗了。因为他需要你这个不自觉的同谋者为他服务。”</p> 
<p>“那是为什么？……”路路通嚷着说。</p> 
<p>“你听我说，上一个月，9月28号那一天，英国国家银行被人偷走了五万五千英镑，这个人的外貌已经被查出来了。喏，这就是有关他的外貌的记录，这简直跟福克先生一模一样。”</p> 
<p>“去你的吧！”路路通用他的大拳头捶着桌子说，“我的主人是世界上最正派的人！”</p> 
<p>“你怎么会知道他是正派人？”费克斯说，“你甚至连认识也不认识他！你在他动身那一天才到他家工作。他找了个毫无意义的借口急急忙忙地离开了伦敦，连行李也不带，只带了一大口袋钞票！你敢担保他是正派人？”</p> 
<p>“我敢担保！我就是敢担保！”可怜的路路通机械地重复着说。</p> 
<p>“那么你是愿意作为他的从犯一起被捕了！”</p> 
<p>路路通两手抱着脑袋，他的脸色全变了。他不敢抬头看费克斯。</p> 
<p>福克先生，艾娥达夫人的救命恩人，这么一个仁慈而又勇敢的人，他会是贼？可是费克斯提出来的那些怀疑又那样活龙活现！路路通是绝不肯相信自己的主人会做这种事的。</p> 
<p>“干脆说吧，你想要我怎么样？”他鼓起最大勇气向费克斯说。</p> 
<p>“喏，”费克斯说，“我盯着福克先生一直盯到今天，但是我还没有接到我向伦敦要的那张拘票，所以我需要你帮助我拖住他留在香港……”</p> 
<p>“你叫我……”</p> 
<p>“我跟你平分英国国家银行许下的两千英镑奖金。”</p> 
<p>“我不干！”路路通说着，就打算站起来，可是他感觉到精神恍惚，又没有力气，于是又坐了下来。</p> 
<p>“费克斯先生，”他结结巴巴他说，“即使你刚才对我说的那些话都是真的……即使我的主人真的是你要抓的那个贼，……我也不承认……我是他的仆人……我看他是个好人，是个仁人君子。要我出卖他，绝对办不到。就是把全世界的金子都给我，我也不能那么干……”</p> 
<p>“你拒绝吗？”</p> 
<p>“我不干！”</p> 
<p>“好吧，那就算我什么也没说，”费克斯说，“来，咱们喝酒。”</p> 
<p>“好，咱们喝酒！”</p> 
<p>路路通觉得越来越醉了。费克斯认为现在必须不惜任何代价把路路通和他的主人隔离开。他决定一不做，二不休。正好桌上放着几支装好了鸦片的烟枪。费克斯拿了一支放到路路通手里，路路通迷迷糊糊地接过来放到嘴上就吸了几口。他的头因为麻醉而感到沉重，结果晕倒了。</p> 
<p>“好了，”费克斯说，“再没有人去通知福克先生卡尔纳蒂克号提早开船的消息了。即使他能走的话，至少这个死不了的法国人是不会再跟着他走了！”费克斯付了账就扬长而去。</p>
