It was all very well for an Englishman like Mr Fogg to make the tour of the world with a carpet-bag; a lady could not be expected to travel comfortably under such conditions. He acquitted his task with characteristic serenity, and invariably replied to the remonstrances of his fair companion, who was confused by his patience and generosity,-- </p> 
<p>`It is in the interest of my journey - a part of my programme.' </p> 
<p>The purchases made, they returned to the hotel, where they dined at a sumptuously served table-d'h?te; after which Aouda, shaking hands with her protector after the English fashion, retired to her room for rest. Mr Fogg absorbed himself throughout the evening in the perusal of the Times and Illustrated London News. </p> 
<p>Had he been capable of being astonished at anything, it would have been not to see his servant return at bed-time. But, knowingpan, or even to Shanghai, which is only eight hundred miles from here. In going to Shanghai we should not be forced to sail wide of the Chinese coast, which would be a great advantage, as the currents run northward, and would aid us. </p> 
<p>`Pilot,' said Mr Fogg, `I must take the American steamer at Yokohama, and not at Shanghai or Nagasaki.' </p> 
<p>`Why not?' returned the pilot. `The San Francisco steamer does not start from Yokohama. It puts in at Yokohama and Nagasaki, but it starts from Shanghai.' </p> 
<p>`You are sure of that?' </p> 
<p>`Perfectly.' </p> 
<p>`And when does the boat leave Shanghai?' </p> 
<p>`On the 11th, at seven in the evening. We have, therefore, four days before us, that is ninety-six hours; and in that time, if we had good luck and a south-west wind, and the sea was calm, we could make those eight hundred miles to Shanghai.' </p> 
<p>`And you could go--' </p> 
<p>`In an hour; as soon as provisions could be got aboard and the sG?ˉ¤àeen observing him attentively approached. It was Fix, who, bowing, addressed Mr Fogg: `Were you not, like me, sir, a passenger by the "Rangoon", which arrived yesterday?' </p> 
<p>`I was, sir,' replied Mr Fogg coldly. `But I have not the honour--' </p> 
<p>`Pardon me; I thought I should find your servant here. </p> 
<p>`Do you know where he is, sir?' asked Aouda anxiously. </p> 
<p>`What!' responded Fix, feigning surprise. `Is he not with you?' </p> 
<p>`No,' said Aouda. `He has not made his appearance since yesterday. Could he have gone on board the "Carnatic" without us?' </p> 
<p>`Without you, madam?' answered the detective. `Excuse me, did you intend to sail in the "Carnatic"?' </p> 
<p>`Yes, sir.' </p> 
<p>`So did I, madam, and I am excessively disappointed. The "Carnatic", its repairs being completed, left Hong Kong twelve hours before the stated time, without any notice being given; and we must now wait a week for another steamer.' </p> 
<p>As he said `a week' Fix felt his heart leap for joy. Fogg detained at Hong Kong a week! There would be time for the warrant to arrive, and fortune at last favoured the representative of the law. His horror may be imagined when he heard Mr Fogg say, in his placid voice, `But there are other vessels besides the "Carnatic", it seems to me, in the harbour of Hong Kong.' </p> 
<p>And, offering his arm to Aouda, he directed his steps toward the docks in search of some craft about to start. Fix, stupefied, followed; it seemed as if he were attached to Mr Fogg by an invisible thread. Chance, however, appeared really to have abandoned the man it had hitherto served so well. For three hours Phileas Fogg wandered about the docks, with the determination, if necessary, to charter a vessel to carry him to Yokohama; but he could only find vessels which were loading or unloading, and which could not therefore set sail. Fix began to hope again. </p> 
<p>But Mr Fogg, far from being discouraged, was continuing his search, resolved not to stop if he had to resort to Macao, when he was accosted by a sailor on one of the wharves. </p> 
<p>`Is your honour looking for a boat?' </p> 
<p>`Have you a boat ready to sail?' </p> 
<p>`Yes, your honour; a pilot-boat - No. 43 - the best in the harbour.' </p> 
<p>`Does she go fast?' </p> 
<p>`Between eight and nine knots the hour. Will you look at her?' </p> 
<p>`Yes.' </p> 
<p>`Your honour will be satisfied with her. Is it for a sea excursion?' </p> 
<p>`No; for a voyage.' </p> 
<p>`A voyage?' </p> 
<p>`Yes; will you agree to take me to Yokohama?' </p> 
<p>The sailor leaned on the railing, opened his eyes wide, and said, `Is your honour joking?' </p> 
<p>`No. I have missed the "Carnatic", and I must get to Yokohama by the 14th at the latest, to take the boat for San Francisco.' </p> 
<p>`I am sorry,' said the sailor; `but it is impossible.' </p> 
<p>`I offer you a hundred pounds per day, and an additional reward of two hundred pounds if I reach Yokohama in time.' </p> 
<p>`Are you in earnest?' </p> 
<p>`Very much so.' </p> 
<p>The pilot walked away a little distance, and gazed out to sea, evidently struggling between the anxiety to gain a large sum and the fear of venturing so far. Fix was in mortal suspense. </p> 
<p>Mr Fogg turned to Aouda and asked her, `You would not be afraid, would you, madam?' </p> 
<p>`Not with you, Mr Fogg,' was her answer. </p> 
<p>The pilot now returned, shuffling his hat in his hands. </p> 
<p>`Well, pilot?' asked Mr Fogg. </p> 
<p>`Well, your honour,' replied he; `I could not risk myself, my men, or my little boat of scarcely twenty tons on so long a voyage at this time of year. Besides, we could not reach Yokohama in time, for it is sixteen hundred and sixty miles from Hong Kong.' </p> 
<p>`Only sixteen hundred,' said Mr Fogg. </p> 
<p>`It's the same thing.' Fix breathed more freely. </p> 
<p>`But,' added the pilot; `it might be arranged another way.' </p> 
<p>Fix ceased to breathe at all. </p> 
<p>`How?' asked Mr Fogg. </p> 
<p>`By going to Nagasaki, at the extreme south of Japan, or even to Shanghai, which is only eight hundred miles from here. In going to Shanghai we should not be forced to sail wide of the Chinese coast, which would be a great advantage, as the currents run northward, and would aid us. </p> 
<p>`Pilot,' said Mr Fogg, `I must take the American steamer at Yokohama, and not at Shanghai or Nagasaki.' </p> 
<p>`Why not?' returned the pilot. `The San Francisco steamer does not start from Yokohama. It puts in at Yokohama and Nagasaki, but it starts from Shanghai.' </p> 
<p>`You are sure of that?' </p> 
<p>`Perfectly.' </p> 
<p>`And when does the boat leave Shanghai?' </p> 
<p>`On the 11th, at seven in the evening. We have, therefore, four days before us, that is ninety-six hours; and in that time, if we had good luck and a south-west wind, and the sea was calm, we could make those eight hundred miles to Shanghai.' </p> 
<p>`And you could go--' </p> 
<p>`In an hour; as soon as provisions could be got aboard and the sails put up.' </p> 
<p>`It is a bargain. Are you the master of the boat?' </p> 
<p>`Yes; John Bunsby, master of the "Tankadere".' </p> 
<p>`Would you like some earnest-money?' </p> 
<p>`If it would not put your honour out--' </p> 
<p>`Here are two hundred pounds on account. Sir,' added Phileas Fogg, turning to Fix, `if you would like to take advantage--' </p> 
<p>`Thanks, sir; I was about to ask the favour.' </p> 
<p>`Very well. In half-an-hour we shall go on board.' </p> 
<p>`But poor Passepartout?' urged Aouda, who was much disturbed by the servant's disappearance. </p> 
<p>`I shall do all I can to find him,' replied Phileas Fogg. </p> 
<p>While Fix, in a feverish, nervous state, repaired to the pilot-boat the others directed their course to the police-station at Hong Kong. Phileas Fogg there gave Passepartout's description, and left a sum of money to be spent in the search for him. The same formalities having been gone through at the French consulate, and the palanquin having stopped at the hotel for the luggage, which had been sent back there, they returned to the wharf. </p> 
<p>It was now three o'clock; and pilot-boat No. 43, with its crew on board, and its provisions stored away, was ready for departure. </p> 
<p>The `Tankadere' was a neat little craft of twenty tons, as gracefully built as if she were a racing yacht. Her shining copper sheathing, her galvanized iron-work, her deck, white as ivory, betrayed the pride taken by John Bunsby in making her presentable. Her two masts leaned a trifle backward; she carried brigantine, foresail, storm-jib and standing-jib, and was well rigged for running before the wind; and she seemed capable of brisk speed, which, indeed, she had already proved by gaining several prizes in pilot-boat races. The crew of the `Tankadere' was composed of John Bunsby, the master, and four hardy mariners, who were familiar with the Chinese seas. John Bunsby himself, a man of forty-five or thereabouts, vigorous, sunburnt, with a sprightly expression of the eye, and energetic and self-reliant countenance, would have inspired confidence in the most timid. </p> 
<p>Phileas Fogg and Aouda went on board, where they found Fix already installed. Below deck was a square cabin, of which the walls bulged out in the form of cots, above a circular divan; in the centre was a table provided with a swinging lamp. The accommodation was confined, but neat. </p> 
<p>`I am sorry to have nothing better to offer you,' said Mr Fogg to Fix, who bowed without responding. </p> 
<p>The detective had a feeling akin to humiliation in profiting by the kindness of Mr Fogg. </p> 
<p>`It's certain,' thought he, `though rascal as he is, he is a polite one!' </p> 
<p>The sails and the English flag were hoisted at ten minutes past three. Mr Fogg and Aouda, who were seated on deck, cast a last glance at the quay, in the hope of espying Passepartout. Fix was not without his fears lest chance should direct the steps of the unfortunate servant, whom he had so badly treated, in this direction; in which case an explanation the reverse of satisfactory to the detective must have ensued. But the Frenchman did not appear, and, without doubt, was still lying under the stupefying influence of the opium. </p> 
<p>John Bunsby, master, at length gave the order to start, and the `Tankadere', taking the wind under her brigantine, foresail and standing-jib, bounded briskly forward over the waves. </p>  
<p>虽然艾娥达夫人那么恳切地一再表示反对和推辞，但福克先生还是我行我素，不声不响地完成了他的任务。他回答艾娥达夫人总是这两句老话：</p> 
<p>“这是我自己路上用的，这是我计划好要买的。”</p> 
<p>东西都买齐了。福克先生和艾娥达夫人就回到俱乐部大饭店，去享受他们预定好的那一顿非常丰盛的晚餐，饭后，艾娥达夫人有点疲倦了，她照英国习惯轻轻握了握这位沉静的救命恩人的手，就回自己的房间去了。</p> 
<p>这位尊贵的绅士，整整一个晚上都在专心地阅读《泰晤士报》和《伦敦新闻画报》。</p> 
<p>假如福克先生是一位多疑古怪的人，那么，到了睡觉时候，还不见自己的仆人，他就会感到意外了。但是福克先生知道开往横滨的船在明天早晨以前不会离开香港，所以他对此事也就不太注意。第二天早上，福克先生打铃叫人，路路通还是不在。</p> 
<p>当这位高贵的绅士知道他的仆人根本就没有回旅馆的时候，他是怎样想的，谁也不知道。福克先生只好自己提了旅行袋，一面叫人通知艾娥达夫人，一面叫人去雇轿子。</p> 
<p>这时已经是八点钟了，预计九点半钟满潮，卡尔纳蒂克号要趁着满潮出海。</p> 
<p>轿子到了俱乐部大饭店门口，福克先生和艾娥达夫人一齐坐上了这种舒适的交通工具，后面紧跟着一辆小车子，拉着他们的行李。</p> 
<p>半个小时后，他们到了轮船码头，下了轿子，这时福克先生才知道卡尔纳蒂克号昨天晚上已经开走了。</p> 
<p>福克先生本来打算能一举两得，既找到了船，又找到了路路通。可是没想到两头儿都落了空。但是，他脸上却一点失望的表情也没有，而艾娥达夫人一直不安地看着他，于是，他对她只好这样说：</p> 
<p>“这是个意外，夫人，没什么。”</p> 
<p>就在这时候，旁边有一个人，这个人一直在留神看着福克先生，现在走到他跟前来了。这人就是警察厅的密探费克斯。他跟福克先生打了个招呼，说：</p> 
<p>“您先生不是跟我一样昨天乘仰光号到香港来的旅客吗？”</p> 
<p>“是的，先生，”福克冷冰冰地说，“可是我还没请教您是……”</p> 
<p>“请您原谅，我不过是想希望在这儿能碰到您的仆人。”</p> 
<p>“先生，您知道他现在在什么地方吗？”艾娥达夫人着急地问。</p> 
<p>“怎么着？”费克斯装着吃惊的样子说，“他没跟你们在一块儿吗？”</p> 
<p>“没有，”艾娥达夫人说，“从昨天起他就不见了，他难道会不等我们自己就上船走了？”</p> 
<p>“他会不等你们吗，夫人？”侦探说，“不过，请允许我问一句，你们是不是预备乘这条船走的？”</p> 
<p>“是的，先生。”</p> 
<p>“我也是的，夫人，您看我这一下儿真给弄得狼狈极了。卡尔纳蒂克号修好了锅炉，谁也不通知，就提早了十二小时开出了香港。现在就只好再等八天，搭下一班的船了！”</p> 
<p>费克斯讲到“八天”这两个字的时候，心里感到十分痛快。八天！福克得在香港待八天！等拘票的时间是足足有余了。他这位国家法律的代表人今天总算是交了好运了。</p> 
<p>可是当他听到斐利亚·福克镇静地说出下面一句话的时候，我们可以猜想，那对费克斯是多么狠的当头一棒呵！</p> 
<p>“可是我觉得除了卡尔纳蒂克号，在香港的港口上还有别的船。”</p> 
<p>说完这句话，福克先生就让艾娥达夫人挽着自己的手臂，一齐走向船坞去找其他就要开出的轮船。</p> 
<p>费克斯不知如何是好，紧紧跟在后面，看起来就象是福克手上有一根线牵着他似的。</p> 
<p>福克先生从伦敦出发以来一直都在走好运，可是现在好运象是真的走完了。他在港口上到处找，整整跑了三个小时，他决定如果万不得已就租一条船去横滨；但是他看到的一些船不是正在装货就是正在卸货，当然不能够马上就开。于是费克斯觉得又有指望了。</p> 
<p>但是福克先生并不慌乱，他继续找船，他甚至打算到澳门去找。正在这个时候，他在港口上看见迎面来了一个海员。</p> 
<p>“先生，您找船吗？”这个海员脱下帽子向福克先生说。</p> 
<p>“有就要开的船吗？”福克先生问。</p> 
<p>“是呵，先生，有一条43号引水船，它是我们船队里最好的一条船。”</p> 
<p>“它走得快吗？”</p> 
<p>“每小时至少可以跑八九海里，您愿意看看吗？”</p> 
<p>“好。”</p> 
<p>“您一定会满意的。您是要坐船到海上去玩玩吗？”</p> 
<p>“不，我要坐船旅行。”</p> 
<p>“旅行？”</p> 
<p>“你能把我送到横滨吗？”</p> 
<p>海员听了这句话，不自觉地晃动着下垂的两臂，一双眼睛睁得滚圆。</p> 
<p>“先生，您是开玩笑吧？”海员问。</p> 
<p>“不是开玩笑！卡尔纳蒂克号开了，我没赶上。我必须在十四号以前到横滨，因为我要赶上开往旧金山的船。”</p> 
<p>“抱歉得很，”海员说，“这可没办法。”</p> 
<p>“我每天给你一百英镑（二千五百金法郎）的船费，如果你能按时赶到，我再给你两百英镑的奖金。”</p> 
<p>“这话是真的？”海员问。</p> 
<p>“完全是真的。”福克先生说。</p> 
<p>海员走到一旁，望着大海，显然他是为了赚这样一大笔钱和害怕冒险跑那么远的路这两件事进行思想斗争。</p> 
<p>这时，费克斯待在一旁，心里象有十五个吊桶打水似的七上八下。</p> 
<p>福克先生这时转过身来问艾娥达夫人：</p> 
<p>“坐这条船您不害怕吗，夫人？”</p> 
<p>“跟您在一起，我是不会害怕的，福克先生，”艾娥达夫人说。</p> 
<p>海员两只手转弄着帽子，重新挨近福克先生。</p> 
<p>“怎么样，海员先生？”福克先生问。</p> 
<p>“怎么样，先生，”海员说，“我不能拿我的船员和我，还有您去冒这个险。这么远的路，我这条船只不过二十吨，又赶上这个时令。再说，您的时间也赶不上，从香港到横滨足足一千六百五十海里呵。”</p> 
<p>“只有一千六百海里，”福克先生说。</p> 
<p>“反正都是一样。”</p> 
<p>费克斯这时候大大地松了一口气。</p> 
<p>“不过，”海员接着说，“也许还能想个别的办法。”</p> 
<p>费克斯又紧张了。</p> 
<p>“什么办法？”福克说。</p> 
<p>“从这里到日本南端的港口长崎只有一千一百海里，或者是只到上海。上海离香港只有八百海里。如果去上海，我们可以沿着中国海岸航行，这是一个很有利的条件，并且沿海岸往北又是顺水。”</p> 
<p>“海员先生，”福克先生说，“我正是要到横滨去搭美国的船，我不是要去上海，也不是要去长崎。”</p> 
<p>“干吗不去上海或长崎呢？”海员说。“开往旧金山的客船并不从横滨出发。它是从上海出发的，横滨和长崎只是两个中途停靠的港口。”</p> 
<p>“你对于这些情况很有把握吗？”</p> 
<p>“有把握。”</p> 
<p>“去旧金山的船什么时候离开上海？”</p> 
<p>“十一号下午七点钟。我们还有四天的时间。四天就是九十六小时。我们按每小时平均走八海里计算，只要我们抓紧时间，只要东南风不改变方向，只要海上不起风暴，我们就能按时赶完从这里到上海这八百海里的海路。”</p> 
<p>“你的船什么时候可以开？”</p> 
<p>“过一个钟头就可以开，现在要去买点粮食，还要作开船前的准备工作。”</p> 
<p>“好，我们一言为定……你是船主吗？”</p> 
<p>“是的，我叫约翰·班斯比，唐卡德尔号的船主。”</p> 
<p>“你要我付定钱吗？”</p> 
<p>“要是您愿意的话……”</p> 
<p>“给你，先付两百英镑，”这时，斐利亚·福克又转过身来对费克斯说。“先生，如果您愿意搭这条船……”</p> 
<p>“先生，”费克斯立即回答说，“我正要想说请您帮这个忙呢。”</p> 
<p>“那好吧。过半个钟头，我们上船。”</p> 
<p>“可是路路通呢……”艾娥达夫人说，这个小伙子失踪了，她很不放心。</p> 
<p>“我想尽一切力量替他安置一下。”福克先生回答说。</p> 
<p>当这位心里充满了烦恼、焦虑和愤怒的费克斯走上这条引水船的时候，福克先生和艾娥达夫人正走向香港的警察局。福克先生把路路通的外貌特征告诉了警察局，并且留下一笔足够他回国用的旅费，接着又到法国领事馆办了同样的手续。然后又到俱乐部大饭店取出刚才送回来的行李，最后又乘轿子回到了港口。</p> 
<p>下午三点正，43号引水船的人员已经到齐，粮食已经买来了，开船的准备工作已经做好。</p> 
<p>唐卡德尔号是一条很漂亮的机帆船，全重二十吨。船头很尖，样子很俐落，吃水很深，看起来很象一条竞赛用的游艇，船上铜具都闪闪发亮，连铁器也都电镀了。甲板象象牙似的干干净净。这一切说明了船主约翰·班斯比很会保养他的船。船上有两只稍向后倾的大帆，此外还有后樯梯形帆，前中帆，前樯三角帆，外前帆和顶帆。唐卡德尔号在顺风的时候可以利用这一套应有尽有的设备。看样子这条船一定会走得很好，实际上，它在引水船竞赛会上确实得过好多次奖。</p> 
<p>唐卡德尔号上除了船主约翰·班斯比以外，还有四个船员。这些勇敢的海员们经常风雨无阻地到大海上去寻找海船，把它们领进港口，他们对于海上各处的情况都很熟悉。</p> 
<p>约翰·班斯比是一个四十五岁上下的中年人。身体结实，皮色由于日晒而显得棕红，两眼奕奕有神。从他的脸膛可以看出他是个很有魄力的人。他很稳重，办事很老练，即使最不相信人的人，对他也会完全信赖。</p> 
<p>斐利亚·福克先生和艾娥达夫人上了船。费克斯已经早在船上了。他们从后舱口进了一间正方形的房舱，这间房舱四周的墙壁都设有凹进去的床铺，床铺下面放着半圆形的长凳子。房中间有张桌子，这张桌子被一盏摇摇晃晃的挂灯照得亮堂堂的。这间房舱虽小，但是非常干净。</p> 
<p>“抱歉得很，我不能给您预备一个更舒服的地方，”福克先生对费克斯说。费克斯只是恭敬地点了点头，一句话也没有回答。</p> 
<p>这位警察厅侦探接受了福克先生的款待，心里好象是受到很大委屈似的。</p> 
<p>“毫无疑问，”他心里说，“这是一个很有礼貌的流氓，但是，不管怎样，他总归是个流氓。”</p> 
<p>三点十分，唐卡德尔号张起了帆，随着号角的响声，船上升起了英国的国旗。旅客们都在甲板上坐着。福克先生和艾娥达夫人向码头作最后一次的眺望，他们希望看到路路通是不是真正就此失踪了。</p> 
<p>这时费克斯心里可真有点害怕，因为他怕那个被他耍花招整垮了的倒霉小伙子，也许真的正好这时候就在这个码头上出现，那时，他的西洋镜就会全给拆穿了，那他就会陷于非常不利的地位了。但是，幸亏这个法国人没有出现。毫无疑问，他现在还没有摆脱鸦片烟麻醉的影响。</p> 
<p>约翰·班斯比船主终于驾船出海了。唐卡德尔号上的后樯梯形帆、前中帆和外前帆兜着饱满的海风，在一望无际的大海上奔驰前进。</p>
