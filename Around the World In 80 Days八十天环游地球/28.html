From this point it took an easterly direction towards the jagged Wahsatch Mountains. It was in the section included between this range and the Rocky Mountains that the American engineers found the most formidable difficulties in laying the road, and that the government granted a subsidy of forty-eight thousand dollars per mile, instead of sixteen thousand allowed for the work done the plains. But the engineers, instead of violating nature, avoided its difficulties by winding around, instead of penetrating the rocks. One tunnel only, fourteen thousand feet in length, was pierced in order to arrive at the great basin. </p> 
<p>The track up to this time had reached its highest elevation at the Great Salt Lake. From this point it described a long curve, descending towards Bitter Creek Valley, to rise again to the dividing ridge of the waters between the Atlantic and the Pacific. There were many creeks in this mountainous region, and it was necessary to cross Muddy Creek, Green Creek and others, upon culverts. </p> 
<p>Passepartout grew more and more impatient as they went on, while Fix longed to get out of this difficult region, and was more anxious than Phileas Fogg himself to be beyond the danger of delays and accidents, and set foot on English soil. </p> 
<p>At ten o'clock at night the train, stopped at Fort Bridger station, and twenty minutes later entered Wyoming Territory, following the valley of Bitter Creek throughout. The next day, December 7th, they stopped for a quarter of an hour at Green River station. Snow had fallen abundantly during the night, but, being mixed with rain, it had half melted, and did not interrupt their progress. The bad weather, however, annoyed Passepartout; for the accumulation of snow, by blocking the wheels of the cars, would certainly have been fatal to Mr Fogg's tour. </p> 
<p>`What an idea!' he said to himself. `Why did my master make this journey in winter? Couldn't he have waited for the good season to increase his chances?' </p> 
<p>While the worthy Frenchman was absorbed in the state of the sky and the depression of the temperature, Aouda was experiencing fears from a totally different cause. </p> 
<p>Several passengers had got off at Green Fiver, and were walking up and down the platforms; and among these Aouda recognized Colonel Stamp Proctor, the same who had so grossly insulted Phileas Fogg at the San Francisco meeting. Not wishing to be recognized, the young woman drew back from the window, feeling much alarm at her discovery. She was attached to the man who, however coldly, gave her daily evidences of the most absolute devotion. She did not comprehend, perhaps, the depth of the sentiment with which her protector inspired her, which she called gratitude, but which, though she was unconscious of it, was really more than that. Her heart sank within her when she recognized the man whom Mr Fogg desired, sooner or later, to call to account for his conduct. Chance alone, it was clear, had brought Colonel Proctor on this train; but there he was, and it was necessary, at all hazards, that Phileas Fogg should not perceive his adversary. </p> 
<p>Aouda seized a moment when Mr Fogg was asleep to tell Fix and Passepartout whom she had seen. </p> 
<p>`That Proctor on this train!' cried Fix. `Well, reassure yourself, madam: before he settles with Mr Fogg, he has got to deal with me! It seems to me that I was the more insulted of the two.' </p> 
<p>`And besides,' added Passepartout, `I'll take charge of him, colonel as he is.' </p> 
<p>`Mr Fix,' resumed Aouda, `Mr Fogg will allow no one to avenge him. He said that he would come back to America to find this man. Should he perceive Colonel Proctor, we could not prevent a collision which might have terrible results. He must not see him.' </p> 
<p>`You are right, madam,' replied Fix; `a meeting between them might ruin all. Whether he were victorious or beaten, Mr Fogg would be delayed, and--' </p> 
<p>`And,' added Passepartout, `that would play the game of the gentlemen of the Reform Club. In four days we shall be in New York. Well, if my master does not leave this car during those four days, we may hope that chance will not bring him face to face with this confounded American. We must, If possible, prevent his stirring out of it.' </p> 
<p>The conversation dropped. Mr Fogg had just woken up, and was looking out of the window. Soon after Passepartout, without being heard by his master or Aouda, whispered to the detective, `Would you really fight for him?' </p> 
<p>`I would do anything,' replied Fix, in a tone which betrayed determined will, `to get him back living to Europe!' </p> 
<p>Passepartout felt something like a shudder shoot through his frame, but his confidence in his master remained unbroken. </p> 
<p>Was there any means of detaining Mr Fogg in the car, to avoid a meeting between him and the colonel? It ought not to be a difficult task, since that gentleman was naturally sedentary and little curious. The detective, at least, seemed to have found a way; for, after a few moments, he said to Mr Fogg, `These are long and slow hours, sir, that we are passing on the railway.' </p> 
<p>`Yes,' replied Mr Fogg; `but they pass.' </p> 
<p>`You were in the habit of playing whist,' resumed Fix, `on the steamers.' </p> 
<p>`Yes; but it would be difficult to do so here. I have neither cards nor partners.' </p> 
<p>`Oh, but we can easily buy some cards, for they are sold on all the American trains. And as for partners, if madam plays--' </p> 
<p>`Certainly, sir,' Aouda quickly replied; `I understand whist. It is part of an English education.' </p> 
<p>`I myself have some pretensions to playing a good game. Well, here are three of us, and a dummy--' </p> 
<p>`As you please, sir,' replied Phileas Fogg, heartily glad to resume his favourite pastime - even on the railway. </p> 
<p>Passepartout was despatched in search of the steward, and soon returned with two packs of cards, some pins, counters, and a shelf covered with cloth. </p> 
<p>The game commenced. Aouda, understood whist sufficiently well, and even received some compliments on her playing from Mr Fogg. As for the detective, he was simply an adept, and worthy of being matched against his present opponent. </p> 
<p>`Now,' thought Passepartout, `we've got him. He won't budge.' </p> 
<p>At eleven in the morning the train had reached the dividing ridge of the waters at Bridger Pass, seven thousand five hundred and twenty-four feet above the level of the sea, one of the highest points attained by the track in crossing the Rocky Mountains. After going about two hundred miles, the travellers at last found themselves on one of those vast plains which extend to the Atlantic, and which nature has made so propitious for laying the iron road. </p> 
<p>On the declivity of the Atlantic basin the first streams, branches of the North Platte River, already appeared. The whole northern and eastern horizon was bounded by the immense semicircular curtain which is formed by the southern portion of the Rocky Mountains, the highest being Laramie Peak. Between this and the railway extended vast plains, plentifully irrigated. On the right rose the lower spurs of the mountainous mass which extends southward to the sources of the Arkansas River, one of the great tributaries of the Missouri. </p> 
<p>At half-past twelve the travellers caught sight for an instant of Fort Halleck, which commands that section; and in a few more hours the Rocky Mountains were crossed. There was reason to hope, then, that no accident would mark the journey through this difficult country. The snow had ceased falling, and the air became crisp and cold. Large birds, frightened by the locomotive, rose and flew off in the distance. No wild beast appeared on the plain. It was a desert in its vast nakedness. </p> 
<p>After a comfortable breakfast, served in the car, Mr Fogg and his partners had just resumed whist, when a violent whistling was heard, and the train stopped. Passepartout put his head out of the door, but saw nothing to cause the delay; no station was in view. </p> 
<p>Aouda and Fix feared that Mr Fogg might take it into his head to get out; but that gentleman contented himself with saying to his servant, `See what is the matter.' </p> 
<p>Passepartout rushed out of the car. Thirty or forty passengers had already descended, amongst them Colonel Stamp proctor. </p> 
<p>The train had stopped before a red signal which blocked the way. The engineer and conductor were talking excitedly with a signal-man, whom the station-master at Medicine Bow, the next stopping place, had sent on before. The passengers drew around and took part in the discussion, in which Colonel Proctor, with his insolent manner, was conspicuous. </p> 
<p>Passepartout, joining the group, heard the signalman say, `No! you can't pass. The bridge at Medicine Bow is shaky, and would not bear the weight of the train.' </p> 
<p>This was a suspension-bridge thrown over some rapids, about a mile from the place where they now were. According to the signal-man, it was in a ruinous condition, several of the iron wires being broken; and it was impossible to risk the passage. He did not in any way exaggerate the condition of the bridge. It may be taken for granted that, rash as the Americans usually are, when they are prudent there is good reason for it. </p> 
<p>Passepartout, not daring to apprise his master of what he heard, listened with set teeth, immovable as a statue. </p> 
<p>`Hum!' cried Colonel Proctor; `but we are not going to stay here, I imagine, and take root in the snow?' </p> 
<p>`Colonel,' replied the conductor, `we have telegraphed to Omaha for a train, but it is not likely that it will reach Medicine Bow in less than six hours. </p> 
<p>`Six hours!' cried Passepartout. </p> 
<p>`Certainly,' returned the conductor. `Besides, it will take us as long as that to reach Medicine Bow on foot.' </p> 
<p>`But it is only a mile from here,' said one of the passengers. </p> 
<p>`Yes, but it's on the other side of the river.' </p> 
<p>`And can't we cross that in a boat?' asked the colonel. </p> 
<p>`That's impossible. The creek is swelled by the rains. It is a rapid, and we shall have to make a circuit of ten miles to the north to find a ford.' </p> 
<p>The colonel launched a volley of oaths, denouncing the railway company and the conductor; and Passepartout, who was furious, was not disinclined to make common cause with him. Here was an obstacle, indeed, which all his master's bank-notes could not remove. </p> 
<p>There was a general disappointment among the passengers, who, without reckoning the delay, saw themselves compelled to trudge fifteen miles over a plain covered with snow. They grumbled and protested, and would certainly have thus attracted Phileas Fogg's attention if he had not been completely absorbed in his game. </p> 
<p>Passepartout found that he could not avoid telling his master what had occurred, and, with hanging head he was turning towards the car, when the engineer - a true Yankee, named Forster - called out, `Gentlemen, perhaps there is a way, after all, to get over.' </p> 
<p>`On the bridge?' asked a passenger. </p> 
<p>`On the bridge.' </p> 
<p>`With our train?' </p> 
<p>`With our train.' </p> 
<p>Passepartout stopped short, and eagerly listened to the engineer. </p> 
<p>`But the bridge is unsafe,' urged the conductor. </p> 
<p>`No matter,' replied Forster; `I think that by putting on the very highest speed we might have a chance of getting over.' </p> 
<p>`The devil!' muttered Passepartout. </p> 
<p>But a number of the passengers were at once attracted by the engineer's proposal, and Colonel Proctor was especially delighted, and found the plan a very feasible one. He told stories about engineers leaping their trains over rivers without bridges, by putting on full steam; and many of those present avowed.themselves of the engineer's mind. </p> 
<p>`We have fifty chances out of a hundred of getting over,' said one. </p> 
<p>`Eighty! Ninety!' </p> 
<p>Passepartout was astounded, and, though ready to attempt anything to get over Medicine Creek, thought the experiment proposed a little too American. `Besides,' thought he, `there's a still more simple way, and it does not even occur to any of these people! Sir,' said he aloud to one of the passengers, `the engineer's plan seems to me a little dangerous, but--' </p> 
<p>`Eighty chances!' replied the passenger, turning his back on him. </p> 
<p>`I know it,' said Passepartout, turning to another passenger, `but a simple idea--' </p> 
<p>`Ideas are no use,' returned the American, shrugging his shoulders, `as the engineer assures us that we can pass.' </p> 
<p>`Doubtless,' urged Passepartout, `we can pass, but perhaps it would be more prudent--' </p> 
<p>`What! Prudent!' cried Colonel Proctor, whom this word seemed to excite prodigiously. `At full speed, don't you see, at full speed!' </p> 
<p>`I know - I see,' repeated Passepartout; `but it would be, if not more prudent, since that word displeases you, at least more natural--' </p> 
<p>`Who! What! What's the matter with this fellow?' cried several. </p> 
<p>The poor fellow did not know to whom to address himself. </p> 
<p>`Are you afraid?' asked Colonel Proctor. </p> 
<p>`I afraid! Very well; I will show these people that a Frenchman can be as American as they!' </p> 
<p>`All aboard!' cried the conductor. </p> 
<p>`Yes, all aboard!' repeated Passepartout, and immediately. `But they can't prevent me from thinking that it would be more natural for us to cross the bridge on foot, and let the train come after!' </p> 
<p>But no one heard this sage reflection, nor would anyone have acknowledged its justice. The passengers resumed their places in the cars. Passepartout took his seat without telling what had passed. The whist-players were quite absorbed in their game. </p> 
<p>The locomotive whistled vigorously; the engineer, reversing the steam, backed the train for nearly a mile - retiring, like a jumper, in order to take a longer leap. Then, with another whistle, he began to move forward; the train increased its speed, and soon its rapidity became frightful; a prolonged screech issued from the locomotive; the piston worked up and down twenty strokes to the second. They perceived that the whole train, rushing on at the rate of a hundred miles an hour, hardly bore upon the rails at all. </p> 
<p>And they passed over! It was like a flash. No one saw the bridge. The train leaped, so to speak, from one bank to the other, and the engineer could not stop it until it had gone five miles beyond the station. But scarcely had the train passed the river, when the bridge, completely ruined, fell with a crash into the rapids of Medicine Bow. </p>  
<p>美国的筑路工程师们曾在这个包括瓦萨奇群山和洛矶山脉的地区遇到过严重的困难。因此，美利坚合众国政府在这一段路的工程上付出的辅助金，每英里竟达四万八千美元，而在平原地区每英里只需一万六千美元。但是，那些工程师，我们已经说过，他们并没有强行改变自然的地势，在铺设路线时他们巧妙地随着地形兜圈子，绕过了难以通过的大山，把铁路铺向辽阔的平原。在整个这一段路上，只钻了一个一万四千英尺长的山洞。</p> 
<p>这条铁路铺到大咸湖时已经达到了全线标高的顶点。从这里再往前去是一段很长的斜坡，下降到比特尔河盆地，然后将再上行直到距离大西洋和太平洋同样远近的美洲大陆的中央地区。</p> 
<p>在这一带山区，河川很多，铁路必须从污水河、清水河以及其他河流的小桥上穿过。火车离目的地越近，路路通就越不耐烦。至于费克斯，他恨不得立刻飞过这个使人不舒服的地区。他害怕耽搁时间；他担心路上出岔儿，他比斐利亚·福克自己还要着急，他巴不得早些回到英国！</p> 
<p>晚上十点钟，火车到达了布里吉尔堡，几乎连停都没停，立即又继续前进，跑了二十英里就进入了怀俄明州（原名达科他州），沿着整个比特尔河盆地前进。科罗拉多的水力发电系统就是利用比特尔河的一部分水力建设起来的。</p> 
<p>第二天是12月7号，火车在清水河车站停了一刻钟。头一天夜里雨雪交加，如今积雪化了一半，一点也不妨碍火车的继续前进。但是，不论如何，这种坏天气总不能不叫路路通发愁，因为积雪使车轮泡在泥水里，这对于他们的旅行总是不利的。</p> 
<p>“我真不明白，”路路通心里说，“我这位主人为什么要在冬天旅行！要是等到天气暖和点再出来，那不更有把握一些吗？”</p> 
<p>但是，正当这个老实的小伙子只顾担心温度下降和天气变化的时候，艾娥达夫人却在为另一件事感到焦虑不安。</p> 
<p>事情是这样的，有些个旅客下了火车，在清水河车站的月台上散步，等待着开车。艾娥达夫人透过玻璃窗看见在这些旅客中有一个人，他正是那位在旧金山侮辱过斐利亚·福克的斯汤姆·普洛克托上校。艾娥达夫人不愿意被这位上校看见，就转过身去背向车窗。当时的情况使艾娥达夫人感到非常担心，她非常关心福克先生。这位绅士虽然是那么冷静，但是他对艾娥达夫人的体贴却显得日益无微不至。艾娥达夫人也许不大清楚她这位救命恩人在自己心中激起的感情深厚到什么程度，而她自己对这种感情还只能称之为感激。但是她不知道这中间存在着比“感激”更进一步的情感。所以当她发现这个粗暴的上校时，她心里就感到异常紧张，她知道福克先生早晚是要找这人算账的。毫无疑问，普洛克托上校乘这班火车，完全是凑巧。但是，事实上他是已经在这个车子上了，那么就得想尽一切办法不叫斐利亚·福克发现他的仇人。</p> 
<p>当火车开动了之后，艾娥达夫人趁着福克先生正在打盹，就把刚才看见普洛克托上校的事告诉了费克斯和路路通。</p> 
<p>“怎么？”费克斯叫着说，“普洛克托这家伙也在车上！不要紧，夫人，你放心好了，他要跟先生……要跟福克先生找麻烦，一定会先来跟我算账！在这件事清上我认为吃了大亏的主要是我！”</p> 
<p>“再说我也能对付他，”路路通说，“别看他是个上校。”</p> 
<p>“费克斯先生，”艾娥达夫人说，“您要知道福克先生是不会让别人替他出头的。他曾说过，他自己要再到美洲来找这个污辱他的人算账。这会儿，他要是看到了普洛克托上校，我们就没法拦阻他们了，那样事情就会糟了。所以现在必须想办法别叫福克先生看见他。”</p> 
<p>“夫人，您说的对，”费克斯说，“他们要是见面了，那一切都完了，不论福克先生胜败如何，他都会耽搁下来，再说……”</p> 
<p>“那样一来，”路路通说，“就便宜了改良俱乐部的那些老爷们了。只要再过四天，我们就到纽约了！那么在这四天里如果福克先生不出这个车厢，我们可以希望福克先生不会碰上这个该死的美国佬！我们完全可以不叫他们碰头。”</p> 
<p>他们的谈话中断了。因为福克先生已经醒了，他在透过结冰的玻璃欣赏窗外的风光。过了一会儿，路路通不让他的主人和艾娥达夫人听到，低声地问费克斯：</p> 
<p>“您真愿意替福克先生出头跟那家伙干吗？”</p> 
<p>“我要尽一切力量让福克先生活着回到欧洲！”费克斯简单地回答说，从他的口气可以听出他是下了决心的。</p> 
<p>路路通听了这话好象身上打了一个冷颤，但是，他对福克先生的信心却毫不动摇。可是，现在有什么办法把福克先生留在车厢里不让他跟那个上校碰头呢？这也许不难，团为这位绅士生性就是个不爱活动不爱看热闹的人。</p> 
<p>最后费克斯认为自己已经找到了一个好办法。待不多久，他就对斐利亚·福克说：</p> 
<p>“先生，咱们这样坐在火车上，时间过得真是又长又慢啊。”</p> 
<p>“是啊，”福克先生说，“不过虽然慢，还是在过啊！”</p> 
<p>“在船上的时候，”费克斯接着说，“我看您常打‘惠司脱’？”</p> 
<p>“是啊，”斐利亚·福克回答说，“不过在这儿就难了，我现在既没有牌，又没有对手。”</p> 
<p>“哦！牌吗，我们在车上准能买到，美国火车上什么都卖。至于对手……夫人，也许碰巧您也会……”</p> 
<p>“对了，先生，我会，”艾娥达夫人很高兴地说，“我会打‘惠司脱’。这也是我在英国学校学的一门功课哩。”</p> 
<p>“至于我呢，”费克斯接着说，“我很希望能有机会提高自己玩‘惠司脱’的技巧。这就行了，咱们三个来，剩下一边空着……”</p> 
<p>“您既然愿意来，咱们就来吧。”福克先生说，他即使在火车上也很喜欢玩自己特别喜欢的“惠司脱”。</p> 
<p>路路通急忙去找乘务员，很快地弄来了两副牌和一些计分用的筹码，另外还有一张铺着台布的小桌子。一切齐备，他们就开始玩牌。艾娥达夫人打得相当好，连一本正经的福克先生有时也称赞她的技巧高明。至于费克斯简直是玩“惠司脱”的头等好手，他跟这位绅士可称为棋逢对手。这时，路路通在旁边看了，心里说：</p> 
<p>“现在我们算是把他给拖住了，他再也不会离开牌桌子了。”</p> 
<p>上午十一点钟，火车到了距离太平洋和大西洋一样远近的地点，也就是到了布里基尔关，这里的地势海拔七千五百二十四英尺。在穿越洛矶山脉的这段铁路线上，这里是地势最高的几个山岗之一。大约再走两百英里，客车才会到达那一片一直延展到大西洋海岸的辽阔平原，在这样的平原上修筑铁路实在大方便了。</p> 
<p>在大西洋盆地的山坡地区，分布着许多由北普拉特河分出来的支流小河。整个北方和东方的地平线都被那由洛矶山脉北部群山构成的一个半侧形大帷幕遮盖着。群山中最高的山峰是拉拉米峰。在这座半圆形大山和铁路之间是一片河川纵横的大平原。铁路右边，是接近群山的斜坡。群山的余脉一直向南延伸到密苏里河的重要支流之一阿肯色河的发源地。</p> 
<p>十二点半，车上旅客瞥见了一座城堡，那就是俯瞰着整个这一地区的哈莱克堡。再过几个钟头，穿越洛矶山脉的旅行就要胜利结束了。人们于是可以指望通过这个困难的山区而不发生任何意外了。雪停了。天气变得更冷。巨大的鹰鹫被奔驰的机车吓得急忙往远处飞逃。平原上没有任何野兽，既没有熊，又没有狼，只是一片荒凉的旷野。</p> 
<p>福克先生和他的同伴们就在自己的车厢里吃了一顿相当舒服的中饭，然后又立即接着打起了那永无休止的“惠司脱”。这时，突然响起一阵哨子声。火车停下来了。</p> 
<p>路路通将头伸出窗外看了一下，没有看到任何阻止火车前进的东西，也没看到车站。</p> 
<p>艾娥达夫人和费克斯很担心福克先生要下车去看看，但是这位绅士只对自己的仆人说了一声：</p> 
<p>“去看看，是怎么回事？”</p> 
<p>路路通立即跑出车厢。这时已经有四十多个旅客出来了，其中就有斯汤姆·普洛克托上校。</p> 
<p>火车停在一个禁止通行的红灯前面。火车司机和列车员已经下来了。他们正在和一个守路员激烈地争论着，这个守路员是前面梅迪西弯车站的站长特地派来等这一趟火车的。旅客们也都走过来参加这一场争论，其中自然少不了刚才说的那位普洛克托上校。他扯开嗓门儿大嚷，指手划脚，神气活现。</p> 
<p>路路通走近了这一群人，他听见守路员说：“不行，没办法通过！梅迪西弯的大桥已经在摇晃，经受不起火车的重压了。”</p> 
<p>他们所说的这座大桥，是一座空悬在一条激流上的吊桥。离这里还有一英里。据守路员说，这座桥就要垮了，上面很多铁索已经断了。冒险通过是不可能的。守路员肯定说不能通过，他确实一点也没有夸大。再说，美国人一向是冒冒失失，满不在乎的；要是连他们也在乎了，那只有疯子才敢去冒险。</p> 
<p>路路通不敢把这事告诉他的主人，他象一座塑像，一动也不动，咬着牙听人家争论。“啊，是这么回事！”普洛克托上校叫着说，“我们走不成了，我看咱们只好在这雪地上扎根儿了！”</p> 
<p>“上校先生，”列车员说，“已经给奥马哈车站打电报了。要他们派一列车来。但是，六点钟以前能不能到梅迪西弯，这还不敢说。”</p> 
<p>“要等到六点钟！”路路通嚷着说。</p> 
<p>“那可不是吗，”列车员说，“再说，我们从这儿步行到前面车站，也得要这么长的时间。”</p> 
<p>“可是，这儿离车站不是只有一英里路吗？”一位旅客问。</p> 
<p>“事实上是一英里，但是得绕道过河啊。”</p> 
<p>“这条河，我们不能坐船过去吗？”上校问。</p> 
<p>“那可办不到，因为下雨河水涨了。水流很急，我们必须兜圈子绕十英里路，从北面一个浅滩上过去。”</p> 
<p>上校于是破口大骂，一会儿埋怨公司不好，一会儿又责备列车员不对。路路通也是怒气冲天，差一点就要帮着上校一齐骂了。</p> 
<p>眼前发生的阻碍是一种物质的力量，路路通的主人钞票再多，即便都拿出来，这一回也解决不了问题。</p> 
<p>此外，所有的旅客也都感到很丧气，耽搁时间暂且不说，旅客还得在这冰天雪地里步行十五六英里。所以，叫喊声和咒骂声乱成了一片，斐利亚·福克要不是一心在玩“惠司脱”的话，这些叫声准会引起他的注意。</p> 
<p>路路通现在觉得必须把情况告诉自己的主人，于是他就低着头走向车厢。正在这个时候，那位火车司机——他名叫孚尔斯特，是一个标准的“洋乞”——大声叫着说：</p> 
<p>“先生们，咱们也许有办法过去。”</p> 
<p>“从桥上过去吗？”一个旅客问。</p> 
<p>“从桥上过去。”</p> 
<p>“开着火车过去？”上校问。</p> 
<p>“开着火车过去。”</p> 
<p>司机这句话的每一个字路路通都听清楚了，他停住了脚步。</p> 
<p>“可是这座桥就要坍了！”列车员说。</p> 
<p>“没关系，”孚尔斯特说，“我们只要把火车开到最大速度，碰运气也许能过去。”</p> 
<p>“见他的鬼！”路路通说。</p> 
<p>但是，立刻就有些旅客对这个建议随声附和表示同意，尤其是普洛克托上校特别拥护这个办法，这个冒失鬼，他觉得完全可以这么干。他甚至还告诉大家说，有些工程师还想过用高速度直线奔驰的办法使火车从“没有桥”的河上飞过去，他还讲了另外一些类似的怪事。说到最后，所有关心这个问题的人都同意了司机的高见。</p> 
<p>“我们准有百分之五十的机会能过去。”一个旅客说。</p> 
<p>“百分之六十的机会。”另一个说。</p> 
<p>“百分之八十……百分之九十的机会！”</p> 
<p>路路通可给吓昏了。虽然他也是准备要用一切办法过这条梅迪西河的，可是现在这个办法他觉得未免有点太“美利坚式”了。</p> 
<p>“再说，”他心里想，“总应该让旅客们先下来，这是一件很简单的事，应当先作，可是这些人根本连想也不想！……”这时路路通就对一个旅客说：“先生，这位司机出的这个主意，我看是有点冒险，可是……”</p> 
<p>“有百分之八十的机会！”这位旅客回答说，他说完这句话就转身走了。路路通又走到另一位先生跟前接着说：</p> 
<p>“我知道有百分之八十的机会，可是您只要想一下……”</p> 
<p>“想有什么用，没什么好想的！”这个听他说话的美国人耸着肩膀说，“司机已经说了，准能过去！”</p> 
<p>“是啊，”路路通说，“能过去，要是更谨慎一点，我们应该……”</p> 
<p>“什么！谨慎！”普洛克托上校碰巧听见了路路通这句话，他跳了起来，嚷着说。“不是谨慎，我告诉你，是开快车，你懂吗？开快车。”</p> 
<p>“我知道……我懂……”路路通说，这时谁也不肯听完他的话，但是他仍然继续说下去，“假如说，‘更谨慎一点’这句话您听不惯那么我就说，为了更合情理一点，至少应该……”</p> 
<p>“他是谁啊？他要干什么？他说什么？他讲什么合情理不合情理啊？……”周围的人都哄起来了。</p> 
<p>这个可怜的小伙子，现在不知道该向谁讲话了。</p> 
<p>“你是害怕了吧？”普洛克托上校问他。</p> 
<p>“我！害怕！”路路通叫着说，“好吧，算了！我要让你们这些人看看，一个法国人也能跟他们一样的‘美利坚’！”</p> 
<p>“上车了！上车了！”列车员喊着说。</p> 
<p>“对，上车，”路路通说，“上车！马上上车！不过你们不能不叫我有自己的想法，最合情理的办法，应该是让旅客们先步行过桥，然后再把车开过去！……”</p> 
<p>但是，他这个合理的想法谁也不同意，谁也不觉得他有道理。旅客们都回到自己的车厢里去了。路路通往自己的坐位上一坐，对于刚才发生的一切连半个字儿也不提。三位玩“惠司脱”的牌迷现在心都在牌上。火车头大声地吼了一声，司机打开了汽门，把火车向后倒开了差不多一英里，就象是一个跳远的健将向后退着准备飞跃。</p> 
<p>紧接着响了第二声汽笛，火车又开始前进了。它不断加快速度，一会儿，速度已经大到了十分可怕的程度，车上只能听见机车发出的一阵隆隆声，活塞每秒钟进返二十次，车轴在机油盒里冒着浓烟，简直可以说整个火车就象以每小时一百英里的速度在前进，铁轨所负担的重量减少了，因为高速抵销了重量。</p> 
<p>列车过去了！就象闪电一样，连个桥影也没来得及看见，简直可以说是从对岸飞过来的，火车一直冲过了车站五英里，司机才勉强把它煞住。但是，列车一过了河，桥就轰隆一声坍落在梅迪西弯的激流里了。</p>
