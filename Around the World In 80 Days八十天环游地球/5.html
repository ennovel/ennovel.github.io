The news of the bet spread through the Reform Club, and afforded an exciting topic of conversation to its members. From the Club it soon got into the papers throughout England. The boasted `tour of the world' was talked about, disputed, argued with as much warmth as if the subject were another Alabama claim. Some took sides with Phileas Fogg, but the large majority shook their heads and declared against him; it was absurd, impossible, they declared, that the tour of the world could be made, except theoretically and on paper, in this minimum of time, and with the existing means of travelling. The Times, Standard, Morning Post, and Daily New, and twenty other highly respectable newspapers scouted Mr Fogg's project as madness; the Daily Telegraph alone hesitatingly supported him. People in general thought him a lunatic, and blamed his Reform Club friends for having accepted a wager which betrayed the mental aberration of its proposer. </p> 
<p>Articles no less passionate than logical appeared on the question, for geography is one of the pet subjects of the English; and the columns devoted to Phileas Fogg's venture were eagerly devoured by all classes of readers. At first some rash individuals, principally of the gentler sex, espoused his cause, which became still more popular when the Illustrated London News came out with his portrait, copied from a photograph in the Reform Club. A few readers of the Daily Telegraph even dared to say, `Why not, after all? Stranger things have come to pass.' </p> 
<p>At last a long article appeared, on the 7th of October, in the bulletin of the Royal Geographical Society, which treated the question from every point of view, and demonstrated the utter folly of the enterprise. </p> 
<p>Everything, it said, was against the travellers, every obstacle imposed alike by man and by nature. A miraculous agreement of the times of departure and arrival, which was impossible, was absolutely necessary to his success. He might, perhaps, reckon on the arrival of trains at the designated hours, in Europe, where the distances were relatively moderate; but when he calculated upon crosSing India in three days, and the United States in seven, could he rely beyond misgiving upon accomplishing his task? There were accidents to machinery, the liability of trains to run off the line, collisions, bad weather, the blocking up by snow, - were not all these against Phileas Fogg? Would he not find himself, when travelling by steamer in winter, at the merry of the winds and fogs? Is it uncommon for the best ocean steamers to be two or three days behind time? But a single delay would suffice to fatally break the chain of communication; should Phileas Fogg once miss, even by an hour, a steamer, he would have to wait for the next, and that would irrevocably render his attempt vain. </p> 
<p>This article made a great deal of noise, and being copied into all the papers, seriously depressed the advocates of the rash tourist. </p> 
<p>Everybody knows that England is the world of betting men, who are of a higher class than mere gamblers; to bet is in the English temperament. Not only the members of the Reform, but the general public, made heavy wagers for or against Phileas Fogg, who was set down in the betting books as if he were a race-horse. Bonds were issued, and made their appearance on 'Change; `Phileas Fogg bonds' were offered at par or at a premium, and a great business was done in them. But five days after the article in the bulletin of the Geographical Society appeared, the demand began to subside: `Phileas Fogg' declined. They were offered by packages, at first of five, then of ten, until at last nobody would take less than twenty, fifty, a hundred! </p> 
<p>Lord Albermarle, an elderly paralytic gentleman, was now the only advocate of Phileas Fogg left. This noble lord, who was fastened to his chair, would have given his fortune to be able to make the tour of the world, if it took ten years; and bet five thousand pounds on Phileas Fogg. When the folly as well as the uselessness of the adventure was pointed out to him, he contented himself with replying, `If the thing is feasible, the first to do it ought to be an Englishman.' </p> 
<p>The Fogg party dwindled more and more, everybody was going against him, and the bets stood a hundred and fifty and two hundred to one; and a week after his departure an incident occurred which deprived him of backers at any price. </p> 
<p>The commissioner of police was sitting in his office at nine o'clock one evening, when the following telegraphic despatch was put into his hands:-- </p>  
<p>FIX, Detective.</p> 
<p>The effect of this despatch was instantaneous. The polished gentleman disappeared to give place to the bank robber. His photograph, which was hung with those of the rest of the members at the Reform Club, was minutely examined, and it betrayed, feature by feature, the description of the robber which had been provided to the police. The mysterious habits of Phileas Fogg were recalled; his solitary ways, his sudden departure; and it seemed clear that, in undertaking a tour round the world on the pretext of a wager, he had had no other end in view than to elude the detectives, and throw them off his track. </p>  
<p>《泰晤士报》、《标准报》、《晚星报》、《每日晨报》和其他二十种有声望的报纸全都反对斐利亚·福克。只有《每日电讯》对福克给予一定限度上的支持。大家都认为福克是个怪人，是个疯子。跟他打赌的那些会员，也受到人们的责难，人们认为想出这种打赌办法的人脑子也有毛病。</p> 
<p>报纸上就这一问题所发表的好些文章，都写得有声有色，头头是道。谁都知道，在英国，凡是涉及地理方面的问题，人人都感兴趣。因此，不论是哪个阶层的读者，都爱看报上与斐利亚·福克旅行有关的文章。</p> 
<p>在开始的几天，特别是在《伦敦新闻画报》发表了福克先生的照片（根据改良俱乐部会员登记表上的照片复制的）以后，有些大胆的人都站在福克一边，其中大部分是妇女。有些绅士特别是那些《每日电讯》的读者，他们甚至说：“嘿！八十天环游地球，凭什么说办不到呢？比这更奇怪的事我们都见过！”但是没有多久，这家报纸的论调似乎也消沉下去了。</p> 
<p>事实是这样的：10月7日英国皇家地理学会的会刊登载了一篇很长的论文，从各方面论证了八十天绕地球一周的问题。它直截了当地指出：干这种事的人简直是神经错乱！根据这篇文章的论点，旅行者会碰到很多人为的和天然的障碍。要完成这样的旅行计划，就需要具有不可思议的准确性。什么时候从什么地方动身；什么时候到达什么地方，都不能有一点差错。而这样准确的吻合是没有的，也是不可能有的。如果是在欧洲这样一段并不太长的交通线上，人们还能勉强算出火车定时到达的钟点，那么，在火车需要三天才能穿过印度七天才能横贯美国大陆的情况下，人们怎么可能把每次出发和到达的时间掌握得那样精确呢？再说，机器出毛病、火车出轨、列车互撞、气候恶劣、积雪阻路，这一切，岂不全是对斐利亚·福克不利吗？冬季里在轮船上，他难道能不受海风和浓雾摆布吗？在横渡大洋的航线上，即使那些最好的客船迟到两三天也不算什么稀罕事！可是，只要有一点耽搁，他整个旅行计划的环链就会完全脱节了，而且连补救的办法都没有。只要福克先生有一次赶不上船，那怕只差几小时，就得再等下一班的船。这几小时的差误就能使他的旅行计划功亏一篑、完全垮台。</p> 
<p>这篇论文引起了很大的反响。差不多所有的报纸都转载了。“福克股票”的价格因此一落千丈。</p> 
<p>原来在福克动身后的那几天，人们拿他这次旅行的成败大做起投机买卖来了。谁都知道英国那些打赌的人是一些什么样的人。他们比那种现钱赌博的人更会动脑筋，更有气派。赌博是英国人天生的嗜好，不仅改良俱乐部的很多会员在大张旗鼓地拿福克的成败打赌，就连英国的广大群众也在进行着这种活动。“斐利亚·福克”这个名字就象一匹赛马的马名字一样被印在一种赌博手册上了。在交易所里也出现了“斐利亚·福克”股票，伦敦市场上也有了它的行市。人们都在按牌价或是超牌价买进卖出“斐利亚·福克”股票，这种股票当时成交很多，真是红极一时。但是，在福克先生出发后的第五天，皇家地理学会会刊发表了那篇论福克旅行的文章之后，市场上“斐利亚·福克”开始供过于求，紧跟着“福克”证券便跌价了。人们都大量抛出。最初按票面价格五分之一减价出售，后来减为十分之一，甚至减为二十分之一，五十分之一，最后竟减为百分之一了。</p> 
<p>支持福克的只剩下一个人了。就是那位半身不遂的阿尔拜马尔老爵士。他是位高贵的绅士，长年瘫坐在一张安乐椅上。如果谁有办法能够使他环游地球一周，即使要费十年工夫，即使要他拿出全部的家产，他也甘心情愿。他肯定福克必胜，他下了四千英镑的赌本来买“斐利亚·福克”股票。人家告诉他福克这个计划是十分愚蠢的。是徒劳无功的，他只是回答说：“要是这桩事可以办得到，那末，首先办到的是一个英国人，那不是很好吗？”</p> 
<p>然而，现在情况已经很不妙了。拥护福克的人越来越少了。人人都反对他，也并非没有道理。福克动身后的第士天“斐利亚·福克”股票兑换率已经不是一百五十或二百对一，而是一文不值了。原来出了一桩完全料想不到的事。</p> 
<p>下面是一份从苏伊士给伦敦拍来的电报：</p> 
<p>苏格兰广场，警察总局局长罗万先生。</p> 
<p>我盯住了银行窃贼斐利亚·福克。速寄拘票至孟买（英属印度）。</p> 
<p>侦探费克斯</p> 
<p>这份电报一发表，马上起了立竿见影的效果，一位高贵的绅士在人们的心目中变成了个偷钞票的贼了。人们看了和俱乐部会员的照片放在一起的福克的照片，发现他的特征跟警察局调查出来的窃贼外貌特点一模一样。于是人们就想到福克平时生活诡秘，想到他性情孤僻和他这次突然出走，显然他是用环游地球作幌子，用荒唐的打赌作掩饰，他的目的只不过是想逃过英国警探的耳目罢了。</p>
