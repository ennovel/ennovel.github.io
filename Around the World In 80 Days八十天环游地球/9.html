The `Mongolia', thanks to the vigorous exertions of the engineer, seemed likely, so rapid was her speed, to reach her destination considerably within that time. The greater part of the passengers from Brindisi were bound for India - some for Bombay, others for Calcutta by way of Bombay, the nearest route thither, now that a railway crosses the Indian peninsula. Among the passengers was a number of officials and military officers of various grades, the latter being either attached to the regular British forces, or commanding the Sepoy troops and receiving high salaries ever since the central government has assumed the powers of the East India Company: for the sub-lieutenants get 280l., brigadiers, 2400l., and generals of division, 4000l. What with the military men, a number of rich young Englishmen on their travels, and the hospitable efforts of the purser, the time passed quickly on the `Mongolia'. The best of fare was spread upon the cabin tables at breakfast, lunch, dinner and the eight o'clock supper, and the ladies scrupulously changed their toilets twice a day; and the hours were whiled away, when the sea was tranquil, with music, dancing and games. </p> 
<p>But the Red Sea is full of caprice, and often boisterous, like most long and narrow gulfs. When the wind came from the African or Asian coast the `Mongolia', with her long hull, rolled fearfully. Then the ladies speedily disappeared below; the pianos were silent; singing and dancing suddenly ceased. Yet the good ship ploughed straight on, unretarded by wind or wave, towards the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. What was Phileas Fogg doing all this time? It might be thought that, in his anxiety, he would be constantly watching the changes of the wind, the disorderly raging of the billows - every chance, in short, which might force the `Mongolia' to slacken her speed, and thus interrupt his journey. But if he thought of these possibilities, he did not betray the fact by any outward sign. </p> 
<p>Always the same impassable member of the Reform Club, whom no incident could surprise, as unvarying as the ship's chronometers, and seldom having the curiosity even to go upon the deck, he passed through the memorable scenes of the Red Sea with cold indifference; did not care to recognize the historic towns and villages which, along its borders, raised their picturesque outlines against the sky; and betrayed no fear of the dangers of the Arabic Gulf, which the old historians always spoke of with horror, and upon which the ancient navigators never ventured without propitiating the gods by ample sacrifices. How did this eccentric personage pass the time on the `Mongolia'? He made his four hearty meals every day, regardless of the most persistent rolling and pitching on the part of the steamer; and he played whist indefatigably, for he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as himself. A tax collector, on the way to his post at Goa; the Rev Decimus Smith, returning to his parish at Bombay; and a brigadier-general of the English army, who was about to rejoin his brigade at Benares, made up the party, and, with Mr Fogg, played whist by the hour together in absorbing silence. </p> 
<p>As for Passepartout, he, too, had escaped seasickness, and took his meals conscientiously in the forward cabin. He rather enjoyed the voyage, for he was well fed and well lodged, took a great interest in the scenes through which they were passing, and consoled himself with the delusion that his master's whim would end at Bombay. He was pleased, on the day after leaving Suez, to find on deck the obliging person with whom he had walked and chatted on the quays. </p> 
<p>`If I am not mistaken,' said he, approaching this person with his most amiable smile, `you are the gentleman who so kindly volunteered to guide me at Suez?' </p> 
<p>`Ah! I quite recognize you. You are the servant of the strange Englishman--' </p> 
<p>`Just so, Monsieur--' </p> 
<p>`Fix.' </p> 
<p>`Monsieur Fix,' resumed Passepartout, `I'm charmed to find you on board. Where are you bound?' </p> 
<p>`Like you, to Bombay.' </p> 
<p>`That's capital! Have you made this trip before?' </p> 
<p>`Several times. I am one of the agents of the Peninsula Company.' </p> 
<p>`Then you know India?' </p> 
<p>`Why - yes,' replied Fix, who spoke cautiously. </p> 
<p>`A curious place, this India?' </p> 
<p>`Oh, very curious. Mosques, minarets, temples, fakirs, pagodas, tigers, snakes, elephants! I hope you will have ample time to see the sights.' </p> 
<p>`I hope so, Monsieur Fix. You see, a man of sound sense ought not to spend his life jumping from a steamer upon a railway train, and from a railway train upon a steamer again, pretending to make the tour of the world in eighty days! No; all these gymnastics, you may be sure, will cease at Bombay.' </p> 
<p>`And Mr Fogg is getting on well?' asked Fix, in the most natural tone in the world. </p> 
<p>`Quite well, and I too. I eat like a famished ogre; it, the sea air.' </p> 
<p>`But I never see your master on deck.' </p> 
<p>`Never; he hasn't the least curiosity.' </p> 
<p>`Do you know, Mr Passepartout, that this pretended tour in eighty days may conceal some secret errand - perhaps a diplomatic mission?' </p> 
<p>`Faith, Monsieur Fix, I assure you I know nothing about it, nor would I give half-a-crown to find out.' </p> 
<p>After this meeting, Passepartout and Fix got into the habit of chatting together, the latter making it a point to gain the worthy man's confidence. He frequently offered him a d@!!! ?瘃^ ~ ?@ch Passepartout never failed to accept with graceful alacrity, mentally pronouncing Fix the best of good fellows. </p> 
<p>Meanwhile the `Mongolia' was pushing forward rapidly; on the 13th, Mocha, surrounded by its ruined walls whereon date-trees were growing, was sighted, and on the mountains beyond were espied vast coffee-fields. Passepartout was ravished to behold this celebrated place, and thought that, with its circular walls and dismantled fort, it looked like an immense coffee cup and saucer. The following night they passed through the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, which means in Arabic `The Bridge of Tears', and the next day they put in at Steamer Point, north-west of Aden harbour, to take in coal. This matter of fuelling steamers is a serious one at such distances from the coal mines; it costs the Peninsular Company some eight hundred thousand pounds a year. In these distant seas, coal is worth three or four pounds sterling a ton. </p> 
<p>The `Mongolia' had still sixteen hundred and fifty miles to traverse before reaching Bombay, and was obliged to remain four hours at Steamer Point to coal up. But this delay, as it was foreseen, did not affect Phileas Fogg's programme; besides, the `Mongolia', instead of reaching Aden on the morning of the 15th, when she was due, arrived there on the evening of the 14th, a gain of fifteen hours. </p> 
<p>Mr Fogg and his servant went ashore at Aden to have the passport again visaed; Fix, unobserved, followed them. The visa procured, Mr Fogg returned on board to resume his former habits; while Passepartout, according to custom, sauntered about among the mixed population of Somalis, Banyans, Parsees, Jews, Arabs and Europeans who comprise the twenty-five thousand inhabitants of Aden. He gazed with wonder upon the fortifications which make this place the Gibraltar of the Indian Ocean, and the vast cisterns where the English engineers were still at work, two thousand years after the engineers of Solomon. </p> 
<p>`Very curious, very curious,' said Passepartout to himself, on returning to the steamer. `I see that it is by no means useless to travel, if a man wants to see something new.' At six p.m. the `Mongolia' slowly moved out of the roadstead, and was soon once more on the Indian Ocean. She had a hundred and sixty-eight hours in which to reach Bombay, and the sea was favourable, the wind being in the north-west, and all sails aiding the engine. The steamer rolled but little, the ladies, in fresh toilets, reappeared on deck, and the singing and dancing were resumed. The trip was being accomplished most successfully, and Passepartout was enchanted with the congenial companion which chance had secured him in the person of the delightful Fix. On Sunday, October 20th, towards noon, they came in sight of the Indian coast: two hour later pilot came on board. A range of hills lay against the sky in the horizon, and soon the rows of palms which adorn Bombay came distinctly into view. The steamer entered the road formed by the islands in the bay, and at half-past four she hauled up at the quays of Bombay. </p> 
<p>Phileas Fogg was in the act of finishing the thirty-third rubber of the voyage, and his partner and himself having, by a bold stroke, captured all thirteen of the tricks, concluded this fine campaign with a brilliant victory. </p> 
<p>The `Mongolia' was due at Bombay on the 22nd; she arrived on the 20th. This was a gain to Phileas Fogg of two days since his departure from London, and he calmly entered the fact in the itinerary, in the column of gains. </p>  
<p>从布林迪西上船的旅客差不多大部分是往印度去的，有的去孟买，有的去加尔各答，但是也要经过孟买，因为自从有了一条横贯整个印度半岛的铁路，就用不着再绕道锡兰了。</p> 
<p>在蒙古号上的乘客中，有各种文官，也有各级武将，有的是英国正规部队的将领，有的是指挥印度士兵的军官，他们的薪俸都很高。</p> 
<p>人们在蒙古号上过得很舒服。在这些官员当中，也有些年轻的英国人，他们是带着巨款到海外去经商的。船上的事务长也就是轮船公司的心腹，在船上的地位和船长相等。他一切事务都搞得很讲究，不论是上午的早餐，下午两点的中餐，五点半的晚餐和八点钟的夜餐，餐桌上都摆满着一盘一盘的新鲜熟肉和其他佐餐小菜。这些食物都是由船上肉类供应处和食品部供应的，船上也有几位女客，她们每天要换装两次。每当海上风平浪静的时候，船上有音乐演奏，人们还可以婆娑起舞。</p> 
<p>但是，红海跟所有那些又窄又长的海湾一样，经常是风浪大作，闹得很凶。海上一起大风，不论是从亚洲海岸或是从非洲海岸吹过来的都要吹得这条装有螺旋推进器的梭形快船蒙古号不住地东摇西晃。这时，女客也不见了，钢琴也不响了，轻歌漫舞统统停止了。但是，尽管是狂风怒吼，海浪滔天，这艘轮船在强大的机器推动下，却仍然毫不含糊地向曼德海峡驶去。</p> 
<p>福克先生这时候在船上干些什么呢？也许人们会以为他一定整天愁眉苦脸地担心着变换莫测的风势会对航行不利，担心着那翻滚的巨浪会使机器发生故障，担心着可能发生的事故会迫使蒙古号在中途港口抛锚，从而打乱了他的旅行计划。</p> 
<p>可是，他一点也没有这么想。即使福克先生真的想到了这些可能发生的不幸事故，他也不会在脸上露出来。他永远是一个不动声色的人，他是改良俱乐部里最沉着稳健的会员，任何意外和不幸都不能使他惊惶失措。他的心情就象船上的时钟一样永远不会激动。人们很少在甲板上碰见他。虽然红海在人类最早的历史上留下过丰富多彩的回忆，但是福克先生根本就不想去看一看。他也不去看那些红海两岸的奇异古城，那浮现在天边的城影简直就象是美丽的图画。他也不想一想那些在这阿拉伯海湾可能发生的危险：古代多少史学家如斯特拉朋、艾里安、阿尔得米多、艾德里西等人一提起这里，无不谈虎色变。从前，路过此处的航海家若不给海神奉献祭品，祈求旅行安全，他们是决不敢冒然航行的。</p> 
<p>那么这位关在蒙古号船舱里的怪客到底在干些什么呢？首先，他照常一日四餐，轮船的摇摆和颠簸都不能打乱他的生活步调，他简直就是一架结构很精致的机器。吃完饭以后，他就打“惠司脱”。对了，他已经找到了打牌的配手，那些人玩起牌来跟他一样着迷。一位是往果阿上任的收税官，一位是回孟买去的传教士德西姆斯·斯密史，另一位是回贝拿勒斯防地去的英国部队的旅长。这三位旅客玩“惠司脱”的瘾头跟福克可算是半斤八两，这四个人一天到晚就是打牌。</p> 
<p>至于路路通，他一点也不晕船，他住在船头上的一等客舱里；他和福克一样，胃口总是很好。说实在话，这样的旅行，他是没什么不乐意的。他是拿定了主意了。要吃得痛快，睡得舒服，沿途欣赏欣赏风景。再说，他肯定地认为这一趟莫名其妙的旅行一到孟买就结束了！</p> 
<p>10月10日，那是从苏伊士出发后的第二天。在甲板上，路路通又遇见在埃及码头上跟他谈过话的那位殷勤的朋友。这当然使他很高兴。</p> 
<p>“我没认错人吧，先生，”路路通露出一副非常讨人喜欢的笑容，走过去对那个人说，“在苏伊士很热心地给我领路的不正是您吗？”</p> 
<p>“是呀！”侦探回答说，“我也认出来了，您就是那位古怪的英国先生的管家……”</p> 
<p>“一点不错，先生您贵姓是……”</p> 
<p>“我叫费克斯。”</p> 
<p>“费克斯先生，”路路通说，“又在船上碰见您，我真太高兴了。您去哪儿？”</p> 
<p>“跟您一样，去孟买。”</p> 
<p>“那好极了。您以前去过孟买吗？”</p> 
<p>“去过几次，”费克斯回答说，“我是东方半岛轮船公司的代办。”</p> 
<p>“那您对印度一定很熟悉了？”</p> 
<p>费克斯不想多谈，只回答说：“是啊，……那当然。”</p> 
<p>“印度是个很有趣的地方吗？”</p> 
<p>“有趣极啦！那儿有很多庄严的回教寺，高高的尖顶塔，宏伟的庙宇，托钵的苦行僧，还有浮图宝塔，花斑老虎，黑皮毒蛇，还有能歌善舞的印度姑娘！我倒希望您能在印度好好逛一逛。”</p> 
<p>“我何尝不想去逛逛呢，费克斯先生，您是完全了解的，哪能叫一个精神健全的人借口说要八十天环游地球来受这份儿罪呢，天天是一下轮船就上火车，刚下火车又上轮船，谁也受不了呀！这种体操式的旅行到了孟买，就完事大吉，没问题，您瞧吧。”</p> 
<p>“福克先生近来身体好吗？”费克斯很随便地问一句。</p> 
<p>“他很好，费克斯先生，我也挺不错。现在吃起饭来活象个饿鬼，这全是受了海洋气候的影响。”</p> 
<p>“您的主人呢？我怎么一直没见他到甲板上来？”</p> 
<p>“他从来不到甲板上来。他是一个不爱看稀罕的人。”</p> 
<p>“路路通先生，您是不是知道，这位装着要八十天环游地球的先生，暗地里可能负有另外的秘密使命……比方说外交使命什么的！”</p> 
<p>“天晓得！费克斯先生，我跟您实说，我一点也不知道。真的，我决不花一个小钱去打听这种事！”</p> 
<p>自从这次会面以后，路路通和费克斯就常常在一起聊天。这位侦探想尽办法跟福克这位管家接近，以便在必要时可以利用他。于是费克斯常常在船上的酒吧间里请路路通喝上几杯威士忌或白啤酒，这个小伙子吃起酒来也毫不窖气。为了不欠人情，他也找费克斯来个回敬。他认定费克斯是个很正派的人。</p> 
<p>蒙古号确是跑得很快，13号这一天，已经看见了莫卡四周塌倒的城墙，城墙上长着一些碧绿的海枣树。远处，在万山丛中，是一片一片的咖啡种植场。路路通眺望着这座名城不禁心旷神怡。依他看来，这座由一些环状的断垣残壁构成的古城，配上旁边那座象个茶杯把子似的破古堡，活象是个巨大的咖啡杯子。</p> 
<p>当天夜里，蒙古号穿过了曼德海峡。这个名字，阿拉伯文的意思是“流泪之门”。第二天是14号，蒙古号停泊在亚丁湾西北的汽船岬，因为要在那里加煤。</p> 
<p>要从那样远的矿区把煤运到汽船岬供应来往的轮船，这确是一件重要而又困难的工作。仅仅东方半岛轮船公司的这一项煤费支出，每年就要花八十万镑（合两千万金法郎）。必须在好几个港口设立储煤栈，但是要把煤炭运到这样遥远的海上，每吨煤价格就高达八十法郎。</p> 
<p>蒙古号到孟买还有一百五十海里的路程，要把船底煤舱加满，必须在汽船岬停留四小时。</p> 
<p>但是，这四小时的耽搁，对于福克先生的旅行计划毫无妨碍，因为这早已在他意料之中。再说，蒙古号本来应在10月15日早晨到达亚丁，而现在才是14号晚上。这就是说，富裕了十五小时。</p> 
<p>福克先生主仆二人都上了岸。这位绅士要去办护照签证手续。而费克斯却悄悄地在后面跟着。福克先生办完签证手续之后，回到船上又继续打他的“惠司脱”。</p> 
<p>亚丁这城市有两万五千居民，其中有索马里兰人、巴尼昂人、帕西人、犹太人、阿拉伯人和欧洲人。路路通和往常一样，在这五光十色的人群中，溜达了一番。他瞻仰了那些使亚丁成为印度洋的直布罗陀的海防要塞，同时欣赏了那些巧夺天工的地下贮水池。两千年来，继所罗门王的工程师之后，有好些英国工程师参加了这儿的修建工作。</p> 
<p>“真有意思，真有意思！”路路通回到船上时自言自语地说，“这下子我可明白了：要想瞧瞧新鲜事，出门旅行最相宜。”</p> 
<p>晚上六点钟，蒙古号起碇了。螺旋推进器的桨翼激打着亚丁湾的海水，不一会儿，就开进了印度洋。蒙古号按规定应该在一百六十八小时内从亚丁开到孟买。而目前印度洋上的气候条件对于航行非常有利，海上一直刮着西北风，船帆有力地帮助机器向前推进。蒙古号由于顺风前进，所以就不大摇晃。这时，浓装艳服的女客们又在甲板上出现了。人们引吭高歌，翩翩起舞，船上又开始欢腾起来。这一段航程就在这样顺利的条件下过去了。路路通由于偶然的巧遇能认识了象费克斯这样一位亲切的朋友，感到非常高兴。</p> 
<p>10月20号，星期日，中午时分，已经看见了印度的海岸。两小时之后，引水员上了蒙古号。地平线上隐约露出了群山的远景，美妙和谐地衬托在碧蓝的天空里。又过了一会儿，就看见了挡着孟买城的一排排生气勃勃的棕榈树。蒙古号驶进了由撒尔赛特岛、科拉巴岛、象岛、屠夫岛环绕而成的港湾，四点半钟，到达了孟买码头。</p> 
<p>这时，斐利亚·福克正打完了今天的第三十三局牌，他跟自己的配手，因为大胆地做了一手好牌，竟拿了十三副，这次航行，也随着这一局牌的大获全胜而告一段落。</p> 
<p>按规定，蒙古号本应在10月22日到达孟买。可是它20号就到了。所以从伦敦起程算起，福克先生已经赢得了两天的时间。福克先生把这时间正式地写在旅行日记的盈余栏里了。</p>
