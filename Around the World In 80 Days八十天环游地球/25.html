These quays, rising and falling with the tide, thus facilitate the loading and unloading of vessels. Alongside them were clippers of all sizes, steamers of all nationalities, and the steamboats, with several decks rising one above the other, which ply on the Sacramento and its tributaries. There were also heaped up the products of a commerce which extends to Mexico, Chile, Peru, Brazil, Europe, Asia and all the Pacific islands. </p> 
<p>Passepartout, in his joy on reaching at last the American continent, thought he would manifest it by executing a perilous vault in fine style; but, tumbling upon some worm-eaten planks, he fell through them. Put out of countenance by the manner in which he thus `set foot' upon the New World, he uttered a loud cry, which so frightened the innumerable cormorants and pelicans that are always perched upon these movable quays, that they flew noisily away. </p> 
<p>Mr Fogg, on reaching shore, proceeded to find out at what hour the firsimprobable, so agitated was the multitude before them. </p> 
<p>Just at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass. All the hands were raised in the air. Some, tightly closed, seemed to disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries - an energetic way, no doubt, of casting a vote. The crowd swayed back, the banners and flags wavered, disappeared an instant, then reappeared in tatters. The undulations of the human surge reached the steps, while all the heads floundered on the surface like a sea agitated by a squall. Many of the black hats disappeared, and the greater part of the crowd seemed to have diminished in height. </p> 
<p>`It is evidently a meeting,' said Fix, `and its object must be an exciting one. Inger the legendary city of 1849 - a city of banditti, assassins and incendiaries, who had flocked hither in crowds in pursuit of plunder; a paradise of outlaws, where they gambled with gold-dust, a revolver in one hand and a bowie-knife in the other: it was now a great commercial emporium. </p> 
<p>The lofty tower of its City Hall overlooked the whole panorama of the streets and avenues, which cut each other at right angles, and in the midst of which appeared pleasant, verdant squares, while beyond appeared the Chinese quarter, seemingly imported from the celestial Empire in a toy-box. Sombreros and red shirts and plumed Indians were rarely to be seen; but there were silk hats and black coats everywhere worn by a multitude of nervously active, gentlemanly-looking men. Some of the streets - especially Montgomery Street, which is to San Francisco what Regent Street is to London, the Boulevard des Italians to Paris, and Broadway to New York - were lined with splendid and spacious stores, which exposed in their windows the products of the entire world. </p> 
<p>When Passepartout reached the International Hotel, it did not seem to him as if he had left England at all. </p> 
<p>The ground floor of the hotel was occupied by a large bar, a sort of restaurant freely open to all passers-by, who might partake of dried beef, oyster soup, biscuits, and cheese, without taking out their purses. Payment was made only for the ale, porter, or sherry which was drunk. This seemed `very American' to Passepartout. The hotel refreshment-rooms were comfortable, and Mr Fogg and Aouda, installing themselves at a table, were abundantly served on diminutive plates by negroes of darkest hue. </p> 
<p>After breakfast, Mr Fogg, accompanied by Aouda, started for the English consulate to have his passport visaed. As he was going out, he met Passepartout, who asked him if it would not be well, before taking the train, to purchase some dozens of Enfield rifles and Colt's revolvers. He had been listening to stories of attacks upon the trains by the Sioux and Pawnees. Mr Fogg thought it a useless precaution, but told him to do as he thought best, and went on to the consulate. </p> 
<p>He had not proceeded two hundred steps, however, when, `by the greatest chance in the world', he met Fix. The detective seemed wholly taken by surprise. What! Had Mr Fogg and himself crossed the Pacific together, and not met on the steamer! At least Fix felt honoured to behold once more the gentleman to whom he owed so much, and as his business recalled him to Europe, he should be delighted to continue the journey in such pleasant company. </p> 
<p>Mr Fogg replied that the honour would be his; and the detective - who was determined not to lose sight of him - begged permission to accompany them in their walk about San Francisco - a request which Mr Fogg readily granted. </p> 
<p>They soon found themselves in Montgomery Street, where a great crowd was collected; the side-walks, street, horse-car rails, the shop-doors, the windows of the houses, and even the roofs, were full of people. Men were going about carrying large posters, and flags and streamers were floating in the wind; while loud cries were heard on every hand. </p> 
<p>`Hurrah for Camerfield!' </p> 
<p>`Hurrah for Mandiboy!' </p> 
<p>It was a political meeting; at least so Fix conjectured, who said to Mr Fogg, `Perhaps we had better not mingle with the crowd. There may be danger in it.' </p> 
<p>`Yes,' returned Mr Fogg; `and blows, even if they are political, are still blows.' </p> 
<p>Fix smiled at this remark; and in order to be able to see without being jostled about, the party took up a position on top of a flight of steps situated at the upper end of Montgomery Street. Opposite them, on the other side of the street, between a coal wharf and a petroleum warehouse, a large platform had been erected in the open air, towards which the current of the crowd seemed to be directed. </p> 
<p>For what purpose was this meeting? What was the occasion of this excited assemblage? Phileas Fogg could not imagine. Was it to nominate some high official - a governor or member of Congress? It was not improbable, so agitated was the multitude before them. </p> 
<p>Just at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass. All the hands were raised in the air. Some, tightly closed, seemed to disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries - an energetic way, no doubt, of casting a vote. The crowd swayed back, the banners and flags wavered, disappeared an instant, then reappeared in tatters. The undulations of the human surge reached the steps, while all the heads floundered on the surface like a sea agitated by a squall. Many of the black hats disappeared, and the greater part of the crowd seemed to have diminished in height. </p> 
<p>`It is evidently a meeting,' said Fix, `and its object must be an exciting one. I should not wonder if it were about the "Alabama", despite the fact that that question is settled.' </p> 
<p>`Perhaps,' replied Mr Fogg simply. </p> 
<p>`At least, there are two champions in presence of each other, the Honourable Mr Camerfield and the Honourable Mr Mandiboy.' </p> 
<p>Aouda, leaning upon Mr Fogg's arm, observed the tumultuous scene with surprise, while Fix asked a man near him what the cause of it all was. Before the man could reply, a fresh agitation arose; hurrahs and excited shouts were heard; the staffs of the banners began to be used as offensive weapons; and fists flew about in every direction. Thumps were exchanged from the tops of the carriages and omnibuses which had been blocked up in the crowd. Boots and shoes went whirling through the air, and Mr Fogg thought he even heard the crack of revolvers mingling in the din. The rout approached the stairway, and flowed over the lower step. One of the parties had evidently been repulsed; but the mere lookers-on could not tell whether Mandiboy or Camerfield had gained the upper hand. </p> 
<p>`It would be prudent for us to retire,' said Fix, who was anxious that Mr Fogg should not receive any injury, at least until they got back to London. `If there is any question about England in all this, and we were recognized, I fear it would go hard with us.' </p> 
<p>`An English subject--' began Mr Fogg. </p> 
<p>He did not finish his sentence; for a terrific hubbub now arose on the terrace behind the flight of steps where they stood, and there were frantic shouts of, `Hurrah for Mandiboy! Hip, hip, hurrah!' </p> 
<p>It was a band of voters coming to the rescue of their allies, and taking the Camerfield forces in flank. Mr Fogg, Aouda and Fix found themselves between two fires; it was too late to escape. The torrent of men, armed with loaded canes and sticks, was irresistible. Phileas Fogg and Fix were roughly hustled in their attempts to protect their fair companion; the former, as cool as ever, tried to defend himself with the weapons which nature has placed at the end of every Englishman's arm, but in vain. A big brawny fellow with a red beard, flushed face, and broad shoulders, who seemed to be the chief of the band, raised his clenched fist to strike Mr Fogg, whom he would have given a crushing blow, had not Fix rushed in and received it in his stead. An enormous bruise immediately made its appearance under the detective's silk hat, which was completely smashed in. </p> 
<p>`Yankee!' exclaimed Mr Fogg, darting a contemptuous look at the ruffian. </p> 
<p>`Englishman!' returned the other. `We will meet again!' </p> 
<p>`When you please.' </p> 
<p>`What is your name?' </p> 
<p>`Phileas Fogg. And yours?' </p> 
<p>`Colonel Stamp Proctor.' </p> 
<p>The human tide now swept by, after overturning Fix, who speedily got upon his feet again, though with tattered clothes. Happily, he was not seriously hurt. His travelling overcoat was divided into two unequal parts, and his trousers resembled those of certain Indians, which fit less compactly than they are easy to put on. Aouda had escaped unharmed, and Fix alone bore marks of the fray in his black and blue bruise. </p> 
<p>`Thanks,' said Mr Fogg to the detective, as soon as they were out of the crowd. </p> 
<p>`No thanks are necessary,' replied Fix; `but let us go.' </p> 
<p>`Where?' </p> 
<p>`To a tailor's.' </p> 
<p>Such a visit was, indeed, opportune. The clothing of both Mr Fogg and Fix was in rags, as if they had themselves been actively engaged in the contest between Camerfield and Mandiboy. An hour after, they were once more suitably attired, and with Aouda returned to the International Hotel. </p> 
<p>Passepartout was waiting for his master, armed with half-a-dozen six-barrelled revolvers. When he perceived Fix, he knit his brows; but Aouda having, in a few words, told him of their adventure, his countenance resumed its placid expression. Fix evidently was no longer an enemy, but an ally; he was faithfully keeping his word. </p> 
<p>Dinner over, the coach which was to convey the passengers and their luggage to the station drew up to the door. As he was getting in, Mr Fogg said to Fix; `You have not seen this Colonel Proctor again?' </p> 
<p>`No.' </p> 
<p>`I will come back to America to find him,' said Phileas Fogg calmly. `It would not be right for an Englishman to permit himself to be treated in that way, without retaliating.' </p> 
<p>The detective smiled, but did not reply. It was clear that Mr Fogg was one of those Englishmen who, while they do not tolerate duelling at home, fight abroad when their honour is attacked. </p> 
<p>At a quarter before six the travellers reached the station, and found the traready to depart. As he was about to enter it, Mr Fogg called a porter, and said to him: `My friend, was there not some trouble today in San Francisco?' </p> 
<p>`It was a political meeting, sir,' replied the porter. </p> 
<p>`But I thought there was a great deal of disturbance in the streets.' </p> 
<p>`It was only a meeting assembled for an election.' </p> 
<p>`The election of a general-in-chief, no doubt?' asked Mr Fogg. </p> 
<p>`No, sir; of a justice of the peace.' </p> 
<p>Phileas Fogg got into the train, which started off at full speed. </p>  
<p>路路通非常高兴他终于到了美洲大陆，他觉得现在必须用自己最漂亮的鹞子翻身的动作跳下船来，才能表达他内心的喜悦，但当他两脚落地，踏在这个烂糟了的浮码头上的时候，差一点没栽个跟斗。小伙子就是用这样狼狈的姿式踏上了美洲大陆。这时他扯高嗓门发出一声惊人的欢呼，把一大群经常停栖在码头上的鸬鹚、塘鹅吓得一哄而散。</p> 
<p>福克先生一下船就打听好了下一班火车开往纽约的时间是下午六点钟。这样一来，他在这加利福尼亚州的最大的城市旧金山还有一整天的时间。他花了三元美金为艾娥达夫人和自己雇了一辆马车。路路通攀上了马车前头的座位，马车立即向国际饭店驶去。</p> 
<p>路路通居高临下，十分好奇地欣赏着这个美国的大城市：宽阔的大街，两旁整齐地排列着低矮的房屋，盎格鲁撒克逊风格的哥特式大教堂和礼拜堂，巨大的船坞，象宫殿一样的仓库——这些仓库有的是用木板搭的，有的是用砖瓦盖的。大街上车辆很多，其中既有四轮马车和卡车，也有电车。人行道上满是行人，其中不仅有美国人和欧洲人，也有中国人和印第安人，他们组成了旧金山的二十万居民。</p> 
<p>看到这一切，路路通心里觉得很奇怪。在1849年时，这里还是一个传奇式的城市。好些杀人放火的亡命之徒和江洋大盗都到这里来找寻生金矿。这里成了人类渣滓麋集之所，人们一手拿枪一手握刀来赌金沙。但这样的“黄金时代”已经一去不复返了。今天的旧金山显出是一座巨大的商业城市。那座设有警卫的市府大厦的高塔俯瞰着全城的大街小巷。这些街道都象刀切似的整整齐齐，直角转弯。马路中间点缀着满眼翠绿的街心公园。再往前去就是华人区，它真象是装在玩具盒里运来的一块中华帝国的土地。如今，在旧金山再也看不见那些头戴宽边大毡帽的西班牙人了，再也看不见爱穿红衬衫的淘金者了，再也看不见带着羽毛装饰的印第安人了。代替他们的是无数身穿黑礼服，头戴丝织帽，拼命追求名利的绅士。有几条街上两旁开着豪华的商店，在它的货架上陈列着世界各地的产品；象蒙哥马利大街就是这样，它可以和伦敦的瑞金大街，巴黎的意大利人街，纽约的百老汇大街相提并论。</p> 
<p>路路通一走进国际饭店，就觉得自己似乎还没有离开英国。</p> 
<p>饭店的楼下是一个宽大的酒吧间。这种酒吧间是一种对顾客“免费”供应的冷食店。这里的肉干、牡蛎汤、饼干和干酪都分文不取。这里有各种饮料：英国啤酒、葡萄牙红酒、西班牙葡萄酒，如果顾客高兴进来喝两杯，舒服舒服，他只要给酒钱就行了。在路路通看来这真是非常美国化的生意经。</p> 
<p>国际饭店的餐厅非常舒适。福克先生和艾娥达夫人在一张餐桌旁坐下，立刻就有几个面目清秀的黑人送来了一小盘一小盘的菜，他们饱饱地吃了一顿。</p> 
<p>饭后，艾娥达夫人陪着福克先生一齐离开饭店，到英国领事馆去办理护照签证手续。在人行道上，福克先生遇见了路路通。路路通问福克先生，在上火车之前，要不要买几支安菲牌马枪，或者买几把寇尔特牌手枪以防万一。因为路路通听说在这段铁路线上常常有西乌人和包尼斯人劫火车。他们劫起火车来就象普通的西班牙小偷一般。福克先生说这种顾虑是多余的。不过他叫路路通自己看着办，想买就买好了。然后福克先生就往领事馆去了。</p> 
<p>福克先生走了还没有两百步，作梦也想不到会迎面碰上了费克斯。这位侦探显得非常惊奇。怎么着！福克先生跟他同坐一条船横渡太平洋，他们在船上就没见过面。总而言之，费克斯能和这位给过自己很多好处的绅士异地重逢，真是感到非常荣幸。目前费克斯的任务需要他回欧洲去，在这一段路上能有这么好的旅伴，那真叫他太高兴了。福克先生回答他说，自己也感到很荣幸。如今费克斯是再也不肯离开福克先生了。他要求福克先生允许陪他们一起参观这个五花八门的旧金山城市。福克先生当然同意了。</p> 
<p>于是，艾娥达夫人、福克先生和费克斯就一起逛起大街来了。不久，他们就走到了蒙哥马利大街。这条街上熙熙攘攘，人流就跟潮水似的，虽然轿式马车和四轮马车往来如梭，但是在人行道上、在马路当中、在电车轨上，都是人，连各家店铺门口和每一座房子的窗口，甚至在屋顶上，到处都是数不清的人群。背着宣传广告牌的人在人丛中走来走去；各色旗帜和标语在人头上迎风招展；四面八方，人声鼎沸，到处都在喊：</p> 
<p>“嘿！拥护卡梅尔菲尔德！”</p> 
<p>“嘿！拥护曼迪拜！”</p> 
<p>原来这是在开群众大会。至少费克斯是这么想。于是也把自己的想法告诉了福克先生并且说：</p> 
<p>“先生，咱们千万别跟这些乱七八糟的人搞在一块，否则，只有挨揍。”</p> 
<p>“说实在的，”福克先生说，“搞政治，动拳头，哪一点也不会比普通拳头轻。”</p> 
<p>费克斯听了福克先生的论断觉得应该笑一下，于是他就笑了。为了不卷入这场混战，艾娥达夫人、斐利亚·福克和费克斯走上了一个台阶的最上一层。这里可以通向一个高岗，在那个高岗上可以俯瞰蒙哥马利大街。对面，横隔着一条马路，是一个煤炭公司的码头和一家石油商行的堆栈；在堆栈和码头中间的空地上，有一座大讲台，只见四面八方的人群都在向那块空地集结。</p> 
<p>这个群众大会是干什么的呢？为什么要开这个大会呢？斐利亚·福克完全不了解。是要选一位高级文官或者武官呢？还是要选一位政府首脑或者国会议员呢？看了这种使全城都陷于异常激动的场面，可以使人作出各种不同的推测。</p> 
<p>正在这时候，人群中发生了一阵惊人的骚动。无数只手都举起来了。在一片叫嚣声中有些人紧握着拳头，高高举起，象是一下子就要打下去似的。而实际上这种姿势大概只不过表示坚决要投某人一票。</p> 
<p>骚动激荡着人群，人群又激起了新的骚动。无数的旗帜，在人头上空飞舞，忽而在人群中隐没，忽而又被举起，这时那些旗帜已经变成破烂的纸片了。突然汹涌的人海向四面扩张，已经到达了福克他们站的台阶前面了，只见无数人头在四面八方蠕动，犹如一阵狂风骤雨击打着辽阔无边的海面。</p> 
<p>“这准是一个群众大会，”费克斯说，“他们准是在讨论一个激动人心的问题，大概还是为了亚拉巴马事件，我一点也不觉得奇怪，虽然这件事早已解决了。”</p> 
<p>“也许是的，”福克先生简单地回答说。</p> 
<p>“不过，看情况，”费克斯说，“显然是卡梅尔菲尔德先生和曼迪拜先生这两位竞选对手碰到一块了。”</p> 
<p>艾娥达夫人挽着斐利亚·福克的手臂，惊慌地看着眼前动乱的人群。费克斯预备向他旁边站着的人打听一下为什么群众情绪会这样激动。正在这时候，忽然间来了一阵更剧烈的骚动。响起了震耳欲聋的欢呼声和咒骂声。各人手里的旗杆都变成了攻击对方的武器。刚才举着的手现在都变成了拳头，到处都是拳头。街上车辆停止了，四轮马车也动不了了，在这些车顶上人们在激烈地互相殴打。不管什么都拿来当作投掷武器了。靴子、鞋子象枪弹一样在空中来回飞舞，同时在人群的叫骂声中好象还夹杂着枪声。</p> 
<p>骚动的人群走近了福克先生站的那个台阶，而且已经涌上台阶的头几层了！虽然现在敌对双方，有一方面已经被迫后退。但是旁观的人们却分辨不出到底是曼迪拜占了上风，还是卡梅尔菲尔德取得了优势。</p> 
<p>“我看咱们最好还是走吧，”费克斯说，他怕“他的”福克先生受到攻击或者出了事儿自己负不起这个责任。“万一这些打架的人真的是为了英国问题，万一他们又认出我们是英国人，那我们就准会被他们给弄得狼狈不堪。”</p> 
<p>“作为一个英国公民……”福克先生说。</p> 
<p>但这位绅士的话还没说完，就听见从他后面那个台阶前边的高岗上发出了一阵可怕的喊叫声。只听见：“哈拉！嘿！嘿！拥护曼迪拜！”原来这是一群选民起来支援他们的伙伴的。他们从侧面向卡梅尔菲尔德的拥护者发动了进攻。福克先生、艾娥达夫人和费克斯正好处在敌对双方的中间，要走也来不及了。这一片象潮水一样的人群，一个个手里都拿着头上裹铁的棍子和大头棒，任何人也无法抵挡，斐利亚·福克和费克斯在保护艾娥达夫人的时候，被人群撞得东倒西歪。依然沉着如故的福克先生想使用自己天生的武器——双手，这是大自然赋予每一个英国人两只臂膀上的武器——进行自卫，但是无济干事。这时候来了一个神气十足的大个子，下颚上生着一撮红胡子，红脸宽肩，看样子好象是这群人的头儿。他举起他那吓人的拳头朝着福克就打。要不是费克斯忠心耿耿抢上前去代替他挨了这一拳，这位绅士准会给揍垮了。霎时间在费克斯那顶被打扁了的丝织高帽底下，已经肿起了一个大疙瘩。</p> 
<p>“洋乞！”福克先生以鄙视的目光望着他的敌人说。</p> 
<p>“英国佬！”对方回答说。</p> 
<p>“我们总有再见的时候！”</p> 
<p>“随便你什么时候都行，您叫什么？”</p> 
<p>“斐利亚·福克，您叫什么？”</p> 
<p>“斯汤姆·普洛克托上校。”</p> 
<p>这几句话说完，人群就拥到一边去了。被撞倒的费克斯马上从地上爬起来，衣裳全破了，但幸亏没有受重伤。他的旅行大衣被撕成了大小不同的两块，他的裤子现在很象某些印第安人喜欢穿的那种预先把后裆剪下来的套裤。</p> 
<p>不过艾娥达夫人这一回总算是安然无恙。只有费克斯一个人代替福克吃了一拳。他们刚离开人群，福克先生就向这位侦探说：</p> 
<p>“谢谢您。”</p> 
<p>“没什么，”费克斯回答说，“走吧。”</p> 
<p>“到哪里去？”</p> 
<p>“找一家服装店去。”</p> 
<p>事实上，现在也真应该到服装店去了。斐利亚·福克和费克斯两个人的衣服都已经破得不象话了，仿佛他们是为了帮助卡梅尔菲尔德或曼迪拜竞选而挨了一顿揍似的。</p> 
<p>一个钟头之后，他们已经恢复了衣冠整洁的仪表。然后到领事馆办完签证手续，就回到了国际饭店。路路通已经等在门口，小伙子身上背着六七支带匕首的手枪。这种枪使用中心撞针发火，能连发六颗子弹。</p> 
<p>路路通一抬头看见福克先生后面跟着个费克斯，马上露出一脸的不高兴。可是等艾娥达夫人简单地叙述了刚才发生的事，小伙子马上又眉开眼笑了。显然，费克斯是说话算话，他已经真的不再是敌人，而变成一个同盟者了。</p> 
<p>晚饭后，福克先生叫人找来了一辆轿式马车，准备装上行李，坐着去火车站。在上马车的时候，福克先生问费克斯：</p> 
<p>“您没有再看见那个叫普洛克托的上校吗？”</p> 
<p>“没看见。”费克斯说。</p> 
<p>“我一定还要回到美洲来找他，”斐利亚·福克冷冰冰地说，“一个英国公民受他们这样欺侮，太不象话了。”</p> 
<p>费克斯微笑了一下，没有答话。但是他看得出来，福克先生是这样一种英国人：如果他在英国不能容忍任何挑衅，那么在外国，他也会为保卫自己的荣誉而进行斗争。</p> 
<p>六点差一刻，他们到了车站，火车就要准备出发了。</p> 
<p>福克先生在上火车的时候问一个铁路职员：</p> 
<p>“朋友，请问您今天旧金山是不是出了什么乱子了？”</p> 
<p>“是在开群众大会，先生。”职员回答说。</p> 
<p>“可是，我觉得大街上好象闹得很厉害。”</p> 
<p>“这不过是一个群众选举大会，没别的。”</p> 
<p>“看样子，一定是要选举一个武装部队的总司令吧？”福克失生问。</p> 
<p>“不是，先生，是要选举一个治安法官。”</p> 
<p>听完了这句话，斐利亚·福克上了火车。火车开足马力飞快地出了车站。</p>
