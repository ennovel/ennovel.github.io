His money meant time. There was so much that was more important than Latin, so many studies that clamored with imperious voices. And he must write. He must earn money. He had had no acceptances. Twoscore of manuscripts were travelling the endless round of the magazines. How did the others do it? He spent long hours in the free reading- room, going over what others had written, studying their work eagerly and critically, comparing it with his own, and wondering, wondering, about the secret trick they had discovered which enabled them to sell their work.</p> 
<p>He was amazed at the immense amount of printed stuff that was dead. No light, no life, no color, was shot through it. There was no breath of life in it, and yet it sold, at two cents a word, twenty dollars a thousand - the newspaper clipping had said so. He was puzzled by countless short stories, written lightly and cleverly he confessed, but without vitality or reality. Life was so strange and wonderful, filled with an immensity of problems, of dreams, and of heroic toils, and yet these stories dealt only with the commonplaces of life. He felt the stress and strain of life, its fevers and sweats and wild insurgences - surely this was the stuff to write about! He wanted to glorify the leaders of forlorn hopes, the mad lovers, the giants that fought under stress and strain, amid terror and tragedy, making life crackle with the strength of their endeavor. And yet the magazine short stories seemed intent on glorifying the Mr. Butlers, the sordid dollar-chasers, and the commonplace little love affairs of commonplace little men and women. Was it because the editors of the magazines were commonplace? he demanded. Or were they afraid of life, these writers and editors and readers?</p> 
<p>But his chief trouble was that he did not know any editors or writers. And not merely did he not know any writers, but he did not know anybody who had ever attempted to write. There was nobody to tell him, to hint to him, to give him the least word of advice. He began to doubt that editors were real men. They seemed cogs in a machine. That was what it was, a machine. He poured his soul into stories, articles, and poems, and intrusted them to the machine. He folded them just so, put the proper stamps inside the long envelope along with the manuscript, sealed the envelope, put more stamps outside, and dropped it into the mail-box. It travelled across the continent, and after a certain lapse of time the postman returned him the manuscript in another long envelope, on the outside of which were the stamps he had enclosed. There was no human editor at the other end, but a mere cunning arrangement of cogs that changed the manuscript from one envelope to another and stuck on the stamps. It was like the slot machines wherein one dropped pennies, and, with a metallic whirl of machinery had delivered to him a stick of chewing-gum or a tablet of chocolate. It depended upon which slot one dropped the penny in, whether he got chocolate or gum. And so with the editorial machine. One slot brought checks and the other brought rejection slips. So far he had found only the latter slot.</p> 
<p>It was the rejection slips that completed the horrible machinelikeness of the process. These slips were printed in stereotyped forms and he had received hundreds of them - as many as a dozen or more on each of his earlier manuscripts. If he had received one line, one personal line, along with one rejection of all his rejections, he would have been cheered. But not one editor had given that proof of existence. And he could conclude only that there were no warm human men at the other end, only mere cogs, well oiled and running beautifully in the machine.</p> 
<p>He was a good fighter, whole-souled and stubborn, and he would have been content to continue feeding the machine for years; but he was bleeding to death, and not years but weeks would determine the fight. Each week his board bill brought him nearer destruction, while the postage on forty manuscripts bled him almost as severely. He no longer bought books, and he economized in petty ways and sought to delay the inevitable end; though he did not know how to economize, and brought the end nearer by a week when he gave his sister Marian five dollars for a dress.</p> 
<p>He struggled in the dark, without advice, without encouragement, and in the teeth of discouragement. Even Gertrude was beginning to look askance. At first she had tolerated with sisterly fondness what she conceived to be his foolishness; but now, out of sisterly solicitude, she grew anxious. To her it seemed that his foolishness was becoming a madness. Martin knew this and suffered more keenly from it than from the open and nagging contempt of Bernard Higginbotham. Martin had faith in himself, but he was alone in this faith. Not even Ruth had faith. She had wanted him to devote himself to study, and, though she had not openly disapproved of his writing, she had never approved.</p> 
<p>He had never offered to show her his work. A fastidious delicacy had prevented him. Besides, she had been studying heavily at the university, and he felt averse to robbing her of her time. But when she had taken her degree, she asked him herself to let her see something of what he had been doing. Martin was elated and diffident. Here was a judge. She was a bachelor of arts. She had studied literature under skilled instructors. Perhaps the editors were capable judges, too. But she would be different from them. She would not hand him a stereotyped rejection slip, nor would she inform him that lack of preference for his work did not necessarily imply lack of merit in his work. She would talk, a warm human being, in her quick, bright way, and, most important of all, she would catch glimpses of the real Martin Eden. In his work she would discern what his heart and soul were like, and she would come to understand something, a little something, of the stuff of his dreams and the strength of his power.</p> 
<p>Martin gathered together a number of carbon copies of his short stories, hesitated a moment, then added his "Sea Lyrics." They mounted their wheels on a late June afternoon and rode for the hills. It was the second time he had been out with her alone, and as they rode along through the balmy warmth, just chilled by she sea-breeze to refreshing coolness, he was profoundly impressed by the fact that it was a very beautiful and well-ordered world and that it was good to be alive and to love. They left their wheels by the roadside and climbed to the brown top of an open knoll where the sunburnt grass breathed a harvest breath of dry sweetness and content.</p> 
<p>"Its work is done," Martin said, as they seated themselves, she upon his coat, and he sprawling close to the warm earth. He sniffed the sweetness of the tawny grass, which entered his brain and set his thoughts whirling on from the particular to the universal. "It has achieved its reason for existence," he went on, patting the dry grass affectionately. "It quickened with ambition under the dreary downpour of last winter, fought the violent early spring, flowered, and lured the insects and the bees, scattered its seeds, squared itself with its duty and the world, and - "</p> 
<p>"Why do you always look at things with such dreadfully practical eyes?" she interrupted.</p> 
<p>"Because I've been studying evolution, I guess. It's only recently that I got my eyesight, if the truth were told."</p> 
<p>"But it seems to me you lose sight of beauty by being so practical, that you destroy beauty like the boys who catch butterflies and rub the down off their beautiful wings."</p> 
<p>He shook his head.</p> 
<p>"Beauty has significance, but I never knew its significance before. I just accepted beauty as something meaningless, as something that was just beautiful without rhyme or reason. I did not know anything about beauty. But now I know, or, rather, am just beginning to know. This grass is more beautiful to me now that I know why it is grass, and all the hidden chemistry of sun and rain and earth that makes it become grass. Why, there is romance in the life-history of any grass, yes, and adventure, too. The very thought of it stirs me. When I think of the play of force and matter, and all the tremendous struggle of it, I feel as if I could write an epic on the grass.</p> 
<p>"How well you talk," she said absently, and he noted that she was looking at him in a searching way.</p> 
<p>He was all confusion and embarrassment on the instant, the blood flushing red on his neck and brow.</p> 
<p>"I hope I am learning to talk," he stammered. "There seems to be so much in me I want to say. But it is all so big. I can't find ways to say what is really in me. Sometimes it seems to me that all the world, all life, everything, had taken up residence inside of me and was clamoring for me to be the spokesman. I feel - oh, I can't describe it - I feel the bigness of it, but when I speak, I babble like a little child. It is a great task to transmute feeling and sensation into speech, written or spoken, that will, in turn, in him who reads or listens, transmute itself back into the selfsame feeling and sensation. It is a lordly task. See, I bury my face in the grass, and the breath I draw in through my nostrils sets me quivering with a thousand thoughts and fancies. It is a breath of the universe I have breathed. I know song and laughter, and success and pain, and struggle and death; and I see visions that arise in my brain somehow out of the scent of the grass, and I would like to tell them to you, to the world. But how can I? My tongue is tied. I have tried, by the spoken word, just now, to describe to you the effect on me of the scent of the grass. But I have not succeeded. I have no more than hinted in awkward speech. My words seem gibberish to me. And yet I am stifled with desire to tell. Oh! - " he threw up his hands with a despairing gesture - "it is impossible! It is not understandable! It is incommunicable!"</p> 
<p>"But you do talk well," she insisted. "Just think how you have improved in the short time I have known you. Mr. Butler is a noted public speaker. He is always asked by the State Committee to go out on stump during campaign. Yet you talked just as well as he the other night at dinner. Only he was more controlled. You get too excited; but you will get over that with practice. Why, you would make a good public speaker. You can go far - if you want to. You are masterly. You can lead men, I am sure, and there is no reason why you should not succeed at anything you set your hand to, just as you have succeeded with grammar. You would make a good lawyer. You should shine in politics. There is nothing to prevent you from making as great a success as Mr. Butler has made. And minus the dyspepsia," she added with a smile.</p> 
<p>They talked on; she, in her gently persistent way, returning always to the need of thorough grounding in education and to the advantages of Latin as part of the foundation for any career. She drew her ideal of the successful man, and it was largely in her father's image, with a few unmistakable lines and touches of color from the image of Mr. Butler. He listened eagerly, with receptive ears, lying on his back and looking up and joying in each movement of her lips as she talked. But his brain was not receptive. There was nothing alluring in the pictures she drew, and he was aware of a dull pain of disappointment and of a sharper ache of love for her. In all she said there was no mention of his writing, and the manuscripts he had brought to read lay neglected on the ground.</p> 
<p>At last, in a pause, he glanced at the sun, measured its height above the horizon, and suggested his manuscripts by picking them up.</p> 
<p>"I had forgotten," she said quickly. "And I am so anxious to hear."</p> 
<p>He read to her a story, one that he flattered himself was among his very best. He called it "The Wine of Life," and the wine of it, that had stolen into his brain when he wrote it, stole into his brain now as he read it. There was a certain magic in the original conception, and he had adorned it with more magic of phrase and touch. All the old fire and passion with which he had written it were reborn in him, and he was swayed and swept away so that he was blind and deaf to the faults of it. But it was not so with Ruth. Her trained ear detected the weaknesses and exaggerations, the overemphasis of the tyro, and she was instantly aware each time the sentence-rhythm tripped and faltered. She scarcely noted the rhythm otherwise, except when it became too pompous, at which moments she was disagreeably impressed with its amateurishness. That was her final judgment on the story as a whole - amateurish, though she did not tell him so. Instead, when he had done, she pointed out the minor flaws and said that she liked the story.</p> 
<p>But he was disappointed. Her criticism was just. He acknowledged that, but he had a feeling that he was not sharing his work with her for the purpose of schoolroom correction. The details did not matter. They could take care of themselves. He could mend them, he could learn to mend them. Out of life he had captured something big and attempted to imprison it in the story. It was the big thing out of life he had read to her, not sentence-structure and semicolons. He wanted her to feel with him this big thing that was his, that he had seen with his own eyes, grappled with his own brain, and placed there on the page with his own hands in printed words. Well, he had failed, was his secret decision. Perhaps the editors were right. He had felt the big thing, but he had failed to transmute it. He concealed his disappointment, and joined so easily with her in her criticism that she did not realize that deep down in him was running a strong undercurrent of disagreement.</p> 
<p>"This next thing I've called 'The Pot'," he said, unfolding the manuscript. "It has been refused by four or five magazines now, but still I think it is good. In fact, I don't know what to think of it, except that I've caught something there. Maybe it won't affect you as it does me. It's a short thing - only two thousand words."</p> 
<p>"How dreadful!" she cried, when he had finished. "It is horrible, unutterably horrible!"</p> 
<p>He noted her pale face, her eyes wide and tense, and her clenched hands, with secret satisfaction. He had succeeded. He had communicated the stuff of fancy and feeling from out of his brain. It had struck home. No matter whether she liked it or not, it had gripped her and mastered her, made her sit there and listen and forget details.</p> 
<p>"It is life," he said, "and life is not always beautiful. And yet, perhaps because I am strangely made, I find something beautiful there. It seems to me that the beauty is tenfold enhanced because it is there - "</p> 
<p>"But why couldn't the poor woman - " she broke in disconnectedly. Then she left the revolt of her thought unexpressed to cry out: "Oh! It is degrading! It is not nice! It is nasty!"</p> 
<p>For the moment it seemed to him that his heart stood still. NASTY! He had never dreamed it. He had not meant it. The whole sketch stood before him in letters of fire, and in such blaze of illumination he sought vainly for nastiness. Then his heart began to beat again. He was not guilty.</p> 
<p>"Why didn't you select a nice subject?" she was saying. "We know there are nasty things in the world, but that is no reason - "</p> 
<p>She talked on in her indignant strain, but he was not following her. He was smiling to himself as he looked up into her virginal face, so innocent, so penetratingly innocent, that its purity seemed always to enter into him, driving out of him all dross and bathing him in some ethereal effulgence that was as cool and soft and velvety as starshine. WE KNOW THERE ARE NASTY THINGS IN THE WORLD! He cuddled to him the notion of her knowing, and chuckled over it as a love joke. The next moment, in a flashing vision of multitudinous detail, he sighted the whole sea of life's nastiness that he had known and voyaged over and through, and he forgave her for not understanding the story. It was through no fault of hers that she could not understand. He thanked God that she had been born and sheltered to such innocence. But he knew life, its foulness as well as its fairness, its greatness in spite of the slime that infested it, and by God he was going to have his say on it to the world. Saints in heaven - how could they be anything but fair and pure? No praise to them. But saints in slime - ah, that was the everlasting wonder! That was what made life worth while. To see moral grandeur rising out of cesspools of iniquity; to rise himself and first glimpse beauty, faint and far, through mud- dripping eyes; to see out of weakness, and frailty, and viciousness, and all abysmal brutishness, arising strength, and truth, and high spiritual endowment -</p> 
<p>He caught a stray sequence of sentences she was uttering.</p> 
<p>"The tone of it all is low. And there is so much that is high. Take 'In Memoriam.'"</p> 
<p>He was impelled to suggest "Locksley Hall," and would have done so, had not his vision gripped him again and left him staring at her, the female of his kind, who, out of the primordial ferment, creeping and crawling up the vast ladder of life for a thousand thousand centuries, had emerged on the topmost rung, having become one Ruth, pure, and fair, and divine, and with power to make him know love, and to aspire toward purity, and to desire to taste divinity - him, Martin Eden, who, too, had come up in some amazing fashion from out of the ruck and the mire and the countless mistakes and abortions of unending creation. There was the romance, and the wonder, and the glory. There was the stuff to write, if he could only find speech. Saints in heaven! - They were only saints and could not help themselves. But he was a man.</p> 
<p>"You have strength," he could hear her saying, "but it is untutored strength."</p> 
<p>"Like a bull in a china shop," he suggested, and won a smile.</p> 
<p>"And you must develop discrimination. You must consult taste, and fineness, and tone."</p> 
<p>"I dare too much," he muttered.</p> 
<p>She smiled approbation, and settled herself to listen to another story.</p> 
<p>"I don't know what you'll make of this," he said apologetically. "It's a funny thing. I'm afraid I got beyond my depth in it, but my intentions were good. Don't bother about the little features of it. Just see if you catch the feel of the big thing in it. It is big, and it is true, though the chance is large that I have failed to make it intelligible."</p> 
<p>He read, and as he read he watched her. At last he had reached her, he thought. She sat without movement, her eyes steadfast upon him, scarcely breathing, caught up and out of herself, he thought, by the witchery of the thing he had created. He had entitled the story "Adventure," and it was the apotheosis of adventure - not of the adventure of the storybooks, but of real adventure, the savage taskmaster, awful of punishment and awful of reward, faithless and whimsical, demanding terrible patience and heartbreaking days and nights of toil, offering the blazing sunlight glory or dark death at the end of thirst and famine or of the long drag and monstrous delirium of rotting fever, through blood and sweat and stinging insects leading up by long chains of petty and ignoble contacts to royal culminations and lordly achievements.</p> 
<p>It was this, all of it, and more, that he had put into his story, and it was this, he believed, that warmed her as she sat and listened. Her eyes were wide, color was in her pale cheeks, and before he finished it seemed to him that she was almost panting. Truly, she was warmed; but she was warmed, not by the story, but by him. She did not think much of the story; it was Martin's intensity of power, the old excess of strength that seemed to pour from his body and on and over her. The paradox of it was that it was the story itself that was freighted with his power, that was the channel, for the time being, through which his strength poured out to her. She was aware only of the strength, and not of the medium, and when she seemed most carried away by what he had written, in reality she had been carried away by something quite foreign to it - by a thought, terrible and perilous, that had formed itself unsummoned in her brain. She had caught herself wondering what marriage was like, and the becoming conscious of the waywardness and ardor of the thought had terrified her. It was unmaidenly. It was not like her. She had never been tormented by womanhood, and she had lived in a dreamland of Tennysonian poesy, dense even to the full significance of that delicate master's delicate allusions to the grossnesses that intrude upon the relations of queens and knights. She had been asleep, always, and now life was thundering imperatively at all her doors. Mentally she was in a panic to shoot the bolts and drop the bars into place, while wanton instincts urged her to throw wide her portals and bid the deliciously strange visitor to enter in.</p> 
<p>Martin waited with satisfaction for her verdict. He had no doubt of what it would be, and he was astounded when he heard her say:</p> 
<p>"It is beautiful."</p> 
<p>"It is beautiful," she repeated, with emphasis, after a pause.</p> 
<p>Of course it was beautiful; but there was something more than mere beauty in it, something more stingingly splendid which had made beauty its handmaiden. He sprawled silently on the ground, watching the grisly form of a great doubt rising before him. He had failed. He was inarticulate. He had seen one of the greatest things in the world, and he had not expressed it.</p> 
<p>"What did you think of the - " He hesitated, abashed at his first attempt to use a strange word. "Of the MOTIF?" he asked.</p> 
<p>"It was confused," she answered. "That is my only criticism in the large way. I followed the story, but there seemed so much else. It is too wordy. You clog the action by introducing so much extraneous material."</p> 
<p>"That was the major MOTIF," he hurriedly explained, "the big underrunning MOTIF, the cosmic and universal thing. I tried to make it keep time with the story itself, which was only superficial after all. I was on the right scent, but I guess I did it badly. I did not succeed in suggesting what I was driving at. But I'll learn in time."</p> 
<p>She did not follow him. She was a bachelor of arts, but he had gone beyond her limitations. This she did not comprehend, attributing her incomprehension to his incoherence.</p> 
<p>"You were too voluble," she said. "But it was beautiful, in places."</p> 
<p>He heard her voice as from far off, for he was debating whether he would read her the "Sea Lyrics." He lay in dull despair, while she watched him searchingly, pondering again upon unsummoned and wayward thoughts of marriage.</p> 
<p>"You want to be famous?" she asked abruptly.</p> 
<p>"Yes, a little bit," he confessed. "That is part of the adventure. It is not the being famous, but the process of becoming so, that counts. And after all, to be famous would be, for me, only a means to something else. I want to be famous very much, for that matter, and for that reason."</p> 
<p>"For your sake," he wanted to add, and might have added had she proved enthusiastic over what he had read to her.</p> 
<p>But she was too busy in her mind, carving out a career for him that would at least be possible, to ask what the ultimate something was which he had hinted at. There was no career for him in literature. Of that she was convinced. He had proved it to-day, with his amateurish and sophomoric productions. He could talk well, but he was incapable of expressing himself in a literary way. She compared Tennyson, and Browning, and her favorite prose masters with him, and to his hopeless discredit. Yet she did not tell him her whole mind. Her strange interest in him led her to temporize. His desire to write was, after all, a little weakness which he would grow out of in time. Then he would devote himself to the more serious affairs of life. And he would succeed, too. She knew that. He was so strong that he could not fail - if only he would drop writing.</p> 
<p>"I wish you would show me all you write, Mr. Eden," she said.</p> 
<p>He flushed with pleasure. She was interested, that much was sure. And at least she had not given him a rejection slip. She had called certain portions of his work beautiful, and that was the first encouragement he had ever received from any one.</p> 
<p>"I will," he said passionately. "And I promise you, Miss Morse, that I will make good. I have come far, I know that; and I have far to go, and I will cover it if I have to do it on my hands and knees." He held up a bunch of manuscript. "Here are the 'Sea Lyrics.' When you get home, I'll turn them over to you to read at your leisure. And you must be sure to tell me just what you think of them. What I need, you know, above all things, is criticism. And do, please, be frank with me."</p> 
<p>"I will be perfectly frank," she promised, with an uneasy conviction that she had not been frank with him and with a doubt if she could be quite frank with him the next time.</p> 
<p>他终于决定不听露丝的意见，不顾自己对露丝的爱，不学拉丁文了。他的钱就意味着时间。比拉丁文重要的东西太多。许多学问都迫切要求他去做一他还得写作，还得赚钱他。他的稿子没人要。四十来篇稿件在各家杂志间没完没了地旅行。别的作家是怎么做的？他在免费阅览室花费了大量的时间研究别人出版的东西，急切地、用批评的眼光加以研究，把它们跟自己的作品比较，猜测着、反复猜测着他们所找到的卖出稿子的窍门。 </p> 
<p>地对死气沉沉的出版物数量之庞大感到吃惊。这些作品没何透露出丝毫光明生命或色彩，没有生命在呼吸，却卖得掉，而且两分钱一个字，十元钱一千字——剪报上是这么说的。他为汗牛充栋的短篇小说感到迷惑。他承认它们写得聪明、轻松，但没有生命力和现实感、生命是如此离奇而美妙，充满了数不清的问题、梦想，和英勇的劳动，但那些小说却只在写平庸的生活。他感到了生活的压力和紧张，生活的狂热、汗水和剧变——毫无疑义，这才是值得写的东西！他想要赞美失去希望的事业的项导者，爱得死去活来的情人，在恐怖与悲剧中战斗，饱尝艰苦磨难，以他们的努力逼得生活节节败退的巨人何卜但是杂志上的短篇小说却似乎今注地吹嘘着巴特勒先生这利人，肮脏的逐利之徒和平庸的小男小女的平庸的爱情。这是因为杂志编辑本身就是平底之辈么？他追问．或是团为这些作者、编辑和读者都害怕生活呢？</p> 
<p>但他的主要烦恼却是；他连一个作家、编辑或读音都不认识。而已他不光是不认识作家，就连试过写作的人也不认识。没有人告诉过他。提示过他，给过他十句忠告。他开始怀疑编辑是不是实有的人。他们似乎是机器上的螺丝钉。实际已就是一部机器。他把自己的灵魂注入了小说、散文和诗歌之中，最终却交给了机器去处理。他把稿件像这样折好，跟适员的邮票一起装进长信封，封好，在外面又贴上邮票，再丢进邮筒，让那信去作跨越大陆的旅行。过了一段时间邮递员交还他用另一个长信封装好的稿件，外面贴好地寄去的邮票。旅程的那头并无编辑这个人，只有一套巧妙的机器。那东西把稿件另装一个信封，贴上邮票，跟无人售货机一样，放过硬币就听见一阵机器旋转，然后一包回香糖或一块巧克力就送了出来。是得口香糖或是得巧克力决定手硬币投入了哪个投币口。一个投币口送出的是支票，另一个投币口送出的是退稿条。到目前为止，他找到的只有退稿口。</p> 
<p>那可怕的机器式的过程是由退稿条来完成的。退稿条全是按千篇一律的格式印好的。他收到的已有好几百张——他早期的稿子每份的退稿条都在一打或一打以上。若是在他全部退稿条之中曾有一份上面写了一行字，说了点私人的话，他也会受到鼓舞。但是没有一个编辑证明有那种可能性。因此他只能不结论说那一头并没有温暖的带着人味儿的东西，只有上好了油在机器中美妙运转的齿轮。</p> 
<p>他是个优秀的战士，全心全意，坚定顽强，可以长年累月往机器里喂稿件而心安理得。但他正在流血，流得快要死了，因此战斗的结果只须几个星期就可以见个分晓，用不了几年。他每周的膳宿费通知都把他带近毁灭一步，而四十份稿子的邮资流血之多也同样严重。他再不买书了，还在许多小地方节约，想推迟那无可避免的结局；可他却不知道怎样节约，又给了妹妹茉莉安五块钱买了一件衣服，让结局提前了一个星期。</p> 
<p>他在黑暗中奋斗，没有人为他出主意，也没有人鼓励他。他在挫折的齿缝里挣扎。就连格特露也开始不满意他了。起初她怀着姐姐的溺爱心情纵容了他，认为那是他一时发傻；可是现在，出于做姐姐的关心，她着急了，觉得他的傻劲似乎成了疯狂。马丁明白她的想法，心里比遭到希金波坦唠唠叨叨的公开挖苦还要痛苦。马丁对自己有信心，但这信心是孤独的。就是露丝也没有信心，她曾要求他投身于学习。虽没有反对地写作，却也没表示过赞成。</p> 
<p>他从没有要求露丝读读他的作品，那是因为一种过分的小心。何况她在大学的功课很重，他不愿剥夺她的时间。但在她得到学位之后她却主动要求他让她看一点他的作品。马丁很高兴，却又信心不足。现在有了裁判员了。</p> 
<p>是个文学学士，在内行的教师指导下研究过文学。编辑们说不定L是能干的裁判员，但她跟他们不同，不会交给他一张千篇一律的退稿条，也不会告诉他他的作品没被选中未必意味着没有长处。她是个活生生的人，会说话，会以她那敏锐和聪明的方式说话。最重要的是，她可以多少看到真正的马丁·伊登，从他的作品观察到他的心智和灵魂，因而理解某些东西：他梦想的是什么，能力有多强之类，哪怕是一点点。</p> 
<p>马丁选了他几个短篇小说的复写本，犹豫了一会儿，又加上了他的《海上抒情诗》。两人在一个六月的下午骑上自行车到了丘陵地区。那是他第二次跟她单独外出。芬芳温暖的空气被海风一吹，冷却下来，变得凉爽宜人。他俩骑车前进时他获得了一个深刻的印象：这是个非常美丽的、秩序井然的世界，活着而且恋爱着真是十分美好的事。他俩把自行车留在路旁，爬上了一个境界开阔的褐色丘陵。那儿被太阳晒干了的草心满意足地散发出一种收获季节的于香味儿。</p> 
<p>“草地的任务完成了，”马丁说。两人安顿下来。露丝坐在马丁的外衣上，马丁趴着，紧贴在暖烘烘的地上。他嗅了嗅褐色的草的甜香。那香味儿进入了他的脑子，催动他的思想从特殊到一股旋转着。“它已找到了它存在的理由，”他说下去，深情地拍打着干草。“它在去年冬天凄凉的猛雨中立下志向，跟暴虐的早春作了斗争，开了花，引来了虫子和蜜蜂，撒播了种子，尽了本分，偿请了对世界的债，于是——”</p> 
<p>“你为什么总用这样实际得可怕的眼睛看事物？”她插嘴道。</p> 
<p>“因为我一直在研究进化论，我想。若要告诉你实情的话，我可是最近才睁开眼睛呢。”</p> 
<p>“但我似乎觉得像你这样实际是会错过了美的。你像小孩捉住蝴蝶，弄掉了它美丽的翅膀上的鳞粉一样，破坏了美。”</p> 
<p>他摇摇头。</p> 
<p>“美是有意义的，但我以前不知道，只把美看作是没有意义的东西，认为美就是美，并无道理可言，这就说明我对美一无所知。可现在我知道了，确切地说，是开始知道了，现在我知道了草是怎样变成草的。在我知道了形成草的阳光、雨露、土壤的隐秘化学变化之后，便觉得单更加美丽了。的确，任何一片草叶的生命史中都有它的浪漫故事，是的，还有冒险故事。一想到这些我便心情激动。我想到力与物质之间的相互作用，其中的浩瀚巨大的斗争，便觉得自己似乎可以写一首小旱史诗。”</p> 
<p>“你谈得多好呀，”她心不在焉地说，他注意到她正用探索的目光望着他。</p> 
<p>顷刻之间他慌乱了、不好意思了，血涌了上来，脖子和额头都红了。</p> 
<p>“我希望自己是在学着说话，”他结巴地说，“我似乎有一肚子的话要说，全都是些大题目。我找不出办法表示心里真正的感受。有时我似乎觉得整个世界、整个生命、一切的一切都在我心中生存，叫嚣着要我为它们说话。我感到了——啊，我无法描述——我感到了它的巨大，但一说起话来，却只能睁睁晤晤像个娃娃。把情绪和感受转化成文字或话语，能使读者或听话的人倒过来转化成心中同样的情绪或感受是一项艰巨的任务，一项不同凡响的任务。你看，我把脸理进草里，从鼻孔吸进的清香使我浮想连翩，全身战栗。我嗅到的是宇宙的气息。我知道歌声和欢笑、成功与痛苦、斗争和死亡；草的香气不知怎么在我的头脑里引起了种种幻影，我看见了这些幻影，我想把这一切告诉你，告诉全世界，可我的舌头不管用，它怎样才能管用呢？我刚才就是想向你用言语描绘草的香味对我的影响，但是没有成功。只是用拙劣的言词勾画了一下。我觉得自己说出的似乎全是废话。我憋闷得慌，急于表达。啊——”他的手向上一挥，做了个失望的手势——“我做不到，别人不理解！无法沟通！”</p> 
<p>“但是你的确说得很好，”她坚持说，“想想看，在我认识你之后的短暂时间里，你已经有了多大的进步！巴特勒先生是个有名的演说家。选举的时候州委会常常要他到各地去演说，可你说得就跟他那天晚上在宴会上说得一样精彩。只是他更有控制，而你太激动而已。只要多说几回就好了。你可以成为一个优秀的演说家，只要你愿意干，你是可以大有作为的。你是个出类拔草的人，我相信你可以领导群众，凡是你想干的事没有理由于不成功。你在语法上的成功便是一个例子。你可以成为一个优秀的律师。你应当在政治上辉煌起来。没有东西能阻挡你取得眼巴特勒先生同样伟大的成功的——还不会消化不良。”她笑着补充了最后一句。</p> 
<p>两人继续谈下去。她总是温文尔雅坚持不懈地回到一个问题：教育必须全面打好基础，拉丁文是基础的一部分，对从事任何事业都大有好处。她描绘出了她理想的成功者。那大体是她父亲的形象，其中明确无误地夹杂着一些巴特勒先生形象的线条与色彩。他躺在地上尖起耳朵专注地听着，抬头望着她，欣赏着她说话时嘴唇的每一动作，但脑子却装不进去。她所描绘的图画并不迷人。他隐约感到失望的痛苦，因为对她的爱那痛苦尤其尖锐。她的全部谈话没有一个字涉及他的写作。他带来念的稿子躺在地上受到冷落。</p> 
<p>谈话终于暂停，他瞥了一眼太阳，估计了一下它跟地平线的距离，作为一种暗示拿起了稿子。</p> 
<p>“我简直忘了，”她急忙说，“我非常想听呢！”</p> 
<p>他为她念了一篇自己认为最好的短篇小说。他把它叫做《生命之酒》。故事里的酒是在他写作时悄悄钻进他脑子的，现许他一念，那酒又钻进了他的脑了，故事的轮廓本来就有相当的魅力，他又用文采和点缀加以渲染。他当初写作时的火焰与热情又在他心里燃起．使他陶醉，因而看不见也听不到自己作品的缺点了。露丝却不同。她那训练有素的耳朵听出了它的薄弱和夸张之处和初学者过分渲染的地方。句子的节奏一有疙瘩和拖沓也都立即为她察觉。除此之外只要没有太装腔作势她都几乎置节奏于不顾。作品那业余味儿给了她不愉快的印象。业余水平，这是她对整个小说的最后评价。不过她没有直说，相反，在他念完之后她只指出了一些次要的瑕疵，宣称她喜欢那篇小说。</p> 
<p>但是他失望了。他承认她的评价是公正的，但他仍有一种感觉，他让她听这小说并非要她作课堂式的作文修改。细节并不重要，它们会自生自灭。他可以改，可以学会自己改。他在生活中把握住了某种重大的东西，要把它写进他的小说。他向她念的是那重大的东西，不是句子结构或分号什么的。他要她跟他一起体验属于他的这点重大的东西，那是他用自已的眼睛看见过，在自己的头脑里思考过，用自己的手在纸上打出来的。完了，我失败了，这是他心里的秘密结论。编辑们也许是对的。他感受到了那巨大的东西，却没有表现出来。他隐藏了心中的失望，轻松地附和了她的评价，使她没有意识到他心的深处有一道汹涌的潜流在奔腾。</p> 
<p>“下一篇我把它叫《阴谋》，”他打开稿子说，“已经有四五个杂志退了稿，可我一直认为它不错。实际上我不知道该怎样评价。我只是把捉住了某种东西写了下来。它虽使我非常激动，却未必能使你同样激动。篇幅很小，只有两千字。”</p> 
<p>“多么可怕！”他念完了稿子，她叫道。“骇人听闻，说不出的骇人听闻！”</p> 
<p>他注意到了她那苍白的脸色，神色紧张的瞪大的双眼，和捏紧的拳头，心中暗暗满意。他成功了，他已表达出了自己在头脑中设计的形象与感情，他打中了。无论她喜不喜欢，故事已经抓住了她，支配了她，使她坐在那儿静听，再也不考虑细节。</p> 
<p>“那是生活，”他说，“生洁并非是永远美丽的，也许因为我生性奇特，我在恐怖中找到了一些美丽的东西。我似乎感到正因为它出现在恐怖中．那美丽才增加了十倍，”</p> 
<p>“但，那可怜的女人为什么不能——一”她心不在焉地插嘴道，却又控制了心中的厌恶之情，叫道，“啊！这小说堕落！不美、肮脏卜流！”</p> 
<p>他感到心房似乎暂时停止了跳动。肮脏下流！他做梦也没想到，他设计那个意思，整个情节站在他面前，每个字母都燃前火，燃得那么明亮耀眼。他无论如何也找不出肮脏卜流的东西。他的心恢复了跳动，他问心无愧。</p> 
<p>“你为什么不选一个美好的题材？”是她在说话，“世界上有肮脏下流的东西，这我们知道，可我们没有理由——”</p> 
<p>她怒气冲冲地说下去，但他没有听，只抬起头望着她那处女的脸，心中暗自发笑，那张股多么天真纯洁，天真得令人怜爱、纯洁得动人心魂，能除去他身上的全部脏污，把他浸润于一种天国的灵光之中。那灵光清凉、柔和，如大鹅绒，像星星，世界上有肮脏下流的东西，这我们知道。看来她也知道有肮脏下流的东西，这叫他高兴，心平也不禁暗笑他只把她那话看作是恋爱时的笑话紧接着，千千万万细节的幻影便闪过他心田，他看到了自己所经历过电征服了的肮脏下流的生活的汪洋大海，他原谅了她，同为她不可能了解情况，而那并不是她的错。他感谢上帝她能这样天真无邪、一上不染。但是他却知道生活，知道它的肮脏和美好；知道它的伟大，尽管其中到处总是恶。以上帝发誓他正要向世界发言加以描述呢！天堂卫的圣徒除了美丽纯洁还能怎么样？对他们不必赞颂。但是丑恶渊薮中的圣徒——啊，那才是永恒的奇迹，那才是生命的价值所在．眼看着道德上的伟人从邪恶的泥淖中升起；眼看着白已从泥淖中升起，睁开滴着泥浆的双眼第一次瞥见遥远处隐约存在的美；眼看着力量、真理和崇高的精神天赋从无力、脆弱、恶意、和种种地狱般的兽性中升起——</p> 
<p>从她嘴里说出的一串话语钻进了他的意识。</p> 
<p>“这小说的格调整个儿低下。可现实小却有许多高尚的东西。试以《悼念》为例。”</p> 
<p>他出于无奈，几乎要提起《洛克斯利大厅》。若不是他的幻影又抓住了他，让他盯住着她．他几乎真会说了出来。这跟他同一种属的女人，从远占的萌动评始，在生命的宏大的阶梯上爬行挣扎，经过了亿万斯年，才在最高层出现，演化出了一个露丝，纯洁、美丽、神圣，有力量让他理解爱情，向往纯洁，渴望品尝神性的滋味——地，马丁·伊登，也是。以某种令人惊诧的方式从泥淖中，从无数的错误和无穷多流产的创作中爬出来的。浪漫、奇迹和荣耀都在这平。只要他能表达。这就是写作的素材。天上的圣徒！——圣徒只不过是圣徒，连自己也拯救不了；可他却是个人。</p> 
<p>“你是有力量的，”他听见她在说话，“可那是没经过训练的力量。”</p> 
<p>“你必须培养鉴别能力，必须考虑品位、美和情调。”</p> 
<p>“像一头闯进瓷器店的公牛，”他提出比喻，博得了她一笑。</p> 
<p>“我胆太大，写得太多，”他喃喃地说。</p> 
<p>她微笑同意了，然后坐好，又听下一篇。</p> 
<p>“我不知道你对这一篇会怎么看，”他解释，“这一篇挺好玩，我怕是力不从心，但用意是好的。小的地方不必计较。只看看你是否感觉到其中重大的东西。它重大，也真实，尽管我很可能没有表现出来。”</p> 
<p>他开始读，一边读一边注意她。他终于打动地了。她坐着不动，眼睛紧盯着他，连呼吸也几乎停止了。他觉得她是叫作品的魅力打动了，所得如醉如痴了。他把这小说叫做《冒险》，其实是对冒险的礼赞——不是故事书中那类冒险，而是现实中的冒险。野蛮的头领经历过可怕的惩罚取得了惊人的报偿。信心不足，多次反复要求着可怕的耐性和在辛酸的日夜里的勤劳苦作。面前或是耀眼的灿烂阳光，或是忍饥受渴之后的漆黑的死亡，或是长期高烧，形销骨立，精神严重错乱而死。通过血与汗，蚊叮虫咬，通过一串又一串琐碎平凡的交锋，终于到达了辉煌的结局，取得了壮丽的成就。</p> 
<p>他写进小说的就是这种东西，它的全部，而且更多，他相信在她坐着静听时使她激动的正是这东西。她的眼睛睁得大大的，苍白的面颊泛出了红晕，他结束时似乎感到她快要端不过气来了。她的确激动了，但不是因为故事，而是因为他。她对故事的评价并不高。她感受到的是马丁那雄浑的力，他那一向过剩的精力仿佛正向她汩汩流注，淹没了她。说来也怪，正是满载着他的强力的小说一时成了他的力量向她倾泻的渠道。她只意识到那力量，却忽略了那媒体。在她似乎为他的作品所颠倒时，颠倒她的实际是一种对她还很陌生的东西——一种可怕而危险的思想不期而至，在她头脑里出现。她忽然发觉自己在迷惘着婚姻是什么样子，在她意识到那思想的放纵与狂热时她简直吓坏了。这念头太不适合她的处女身分，也不像她。她还从未因自己的女儿之身而苦恼过。她一向生活在丁尼生诗歌式的梦境里。那精细的大师对闯入王后与骑士之间的粗野成分虽作了微妙的暗示，但她对它的含义却感觉迟钝。她一向沉睡未醒，可现在生命已在迫不及待地猛敲着她的每一扇门扉。她的心灵乱成了一团，正忙着插插销，上门闩，可放纵的本能却在催促她敞开门户，邀请那陌生得美妙的客人进来。</p> 
<p>马丁满意地等着她的判决辞。他对那判决如何毫不怀疑。可一听见她的话却不禁目瞪日呆。——</p> 
<p>“很美。”</p> 
<p>“确实很美，”片刻之后她又着重地重复了这句话。</p> 
<p>当然很美，可其中不光有美，还有别的，有更光芒耀眼的东西，美在它面前只是个婢女。他默默地趴在地上，望着巨大的怀疑以其狰狞的形象在他面前升起。他失败了。他力不从心。他曾看到一个世界上最伟大的东西，却没有表达出来。</p> 
<p>“你对——”他踌躇了一会儿，为第一次使用一个陌生的词感到不好意思。‘你对作品的主题有什么看法？”他问。</p> 
<p>“主题有些混乱，”她回答，“大体说来这就是我唯一的评论。我跟随着故事情节，但其中似乎夹杂了许多别的东西，有些罗嗦。你插进了许多拉杂的东西，妨碍了动作的发展。”</p> 
<p>“可那才是主要的主题呢，”他急忙解释，“是个重大的潜在的主题，广阔无边的具有普遍意义的东西。我努力让它跟故事本身同步发展，可毕竟也只能浮光掠影，我嗅到了一个猎物，看来枪法却不行。我没有写出我想写的东西。不过我总可以学会的。”</p> 
<p>她没有理解他的意思。她是个文学土，但他已超越了禁烟着他的藩篱。对此她并不理解，却把自己的不理解看作是因为他的逻辑不清。</p> 
<p>“你太拉杂，”她说，“但是小说很美，在某些部分。”</p> 
<p>她的声音在他耳里仿佛很辽远，因为他正在考虑是否给她念念《海上抒情诗人他躺在那儿，隐约地感到失望，她却在打量他，又在思考着不期而至的疯狂放肆的婚姻问题。</p> 
<p>“你想成名么？”她突然问他。</p> 
<p>“想，有一点儿想，”他承认，“那是冒险的一部分。重要的不是出名本身，而是出名的过程。而对我来说，成名只是达到另一目的的手段。为了那个目的我非常想成名。”</p> 
<p>“目的就是你，”他想加上这句话。若是她对他念给她听的东西反应热烈，说不定他就会加上的。</p> 
<p>可是她此时正忙着思考，要为他设想出一种至少是可行的事业。她并没有追问他所暗示的最终目的的是什么。文学不是他的事业，对此她深信不疑，向他今天又已用他那些业余半生不熟的作品作了证明。他可以谈得娓娓动听，但不能用文学的手法加以描绘。她用丁尼生、勃朗宁和她爱好的散文大帅跟他作比较，跟他那业无可救药的弱点作比较。但她并没有把心小的话全告诉他，她对他那种奇怪的兴趣使她姑息着他。他的写作欲毕竟只是一种爱好，以后会自然消失的。那时他便会去从事生活中更为严肃的事业，而且取得成功，这她知道，他意志坚强．身体好，是不会失败的——只要他肯放弃写作。</p> 
<p>“我希望你把全部作品都给我看看，伊登地生。”她说。</p> 
<p>他高兴得涨红了脸。他至少可以肯定她已感到了兴趣。她没有给他一张退稿条。她说他的作品某些部分很美，这已是他从别人那里听到的第一个鼓励之辞。</p> 
<p>“好的，”他激动地说，“而且，莫尔斯小姐，我向你保证一定好好干。我知道我的来路很长，要走的路也很长，但我一定要走到，哪旧是手足并用也要走到。”他捧起一叠稿子。“这是《海上抒情诗》，你回家时我再给你，你抽空读一读，请务必告诉我你对它的看法。你知道我最需要的就是批评。请你一定川率地提出意见。”</p> 
<p>“我一定完全们率，”她答应着，心里却感到不安，因为她对他并不坦率，而且怀疑下回对他能否完全坦率。</p>
