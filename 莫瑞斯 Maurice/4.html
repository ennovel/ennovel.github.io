<p>He stood on the platform on Prize Day, reciting a Greek Oration of his own composition. The hall was full of schoolboys and their parents, but Maurice affected to be ad-dressing the Hague Conference, and to be pointing out to it the folly of its ways. "What stupidity is this, O andres Europenaici, to talk of abolishing war? What? Is not Ares the son of Zeus himself? Moreover, war renders you robust by exercising your limbs, not forsooth like those of my opponent." The Greek was vile: Maurice had got the prize on account of the Thought, and barely thus. The examining master had stretched a point in his favour since he was leaving and a respectable chap, and more-over leaving for Cambridge, where prize books on his shelves would help to advertise the school. So he received Grote'sHis-tory of Greece amid tremendous applause. As he returned to his seat, which was next to his mother, he realized that he had again become popular, and wondered how. The clapping continued —it grew to an ovation; Ada and Kitty were pounding away with scarlet faces on the further side. Some of his friends, also leaving, cried "speech". This was irregular and quelled by the authorities, but the Headmaster himself rose and said a few words. Hall was one of them, and they would never cease to feel him so. The words were just. The school clapped not because Maurice was eminent but because he was average. It could cele-</p> 
<p>brate itself in his image. People ran up to him afterwards saying "jolly good, old man", quite sentimentally, and even "it will be bilge in this hole without you." His relations shared in the tri-umph. On previous visits he had been hateful to them. "Sorry, mater, but you and the kids will have to walk alone" had been his remark after a football match when they had tried to join on to him in his mud and glory: Ada had cried. Now Ada was chat-ting quite ably to the Captain of the School, and Kitty was being handed cakes, and his mother was listening to his house-master's wife, on the disappointments of installing hot air. Everyone and everything had suddenly harmonized. Was this the world?</p> 
<p>A few yards off he saw Dr Barry, their neighbour from home, who caught his eye and called out in his alarming way, "Con-gratulations, Maurice, on your triumph. Overwhelming! I drink to it in this cup"—he drained it—"of extremely nasty tea."</p> 
<p>Maurice laughed and went up to him, rather guiltily; for his conscience was bad. Dr Barry had asked him to befriend a little nephew, who had entered the school that term, but he had done nothing—it was not the thing. He wished that he had had more courage now that it was too late and he felt a man.</p> 
<p>"And what's the next stage in your triumphal career? Cam-bridge?"</p> 
<p>"So they say."</p> 
<p>"So they say, do they? And what do you say?"</p> 
<p>"I don't know," said the hero good-temperedly.</p> 
<p>"And after Cambridge, what? Stock Exchange?"</p> 
<p>"I suppose so—my father's old partner talks of letting me in if all goes well."</p> 
<p>"And after you're let in by your father's old partner, what? A pretty wife?"</p> 
<p>Maurice laughed again.</p> 
<p>"Who will present the expectant world with a Maurice the third? After which old age, grandchildren, and finally the daisies. So that's your notion of a career. Well, it isn't mine."</p> 
<p>"What's your notion, Doctor?" called Kitty.</p> 
<p>"To help the weak and right the wrong, my dear," he replied, looking across at her.</p> 
<p>"I'm sure it is all our notions," said the housemaster's wife, and Mrs Hall agreed.</p> 
<p>"Oh no, it's not. It isn't consistently mine, or I should be look-ing after my Dickie instead of lingering on this scene of splen-dour."</p> 
<p>"Do bring dear Dickie to say how d'ye do to me," asked Mrs Hall. "Is his father down here too?"</p> 
<p>"Mother!" Kitty whispered.</p> 
<p>"Yes. My brother died last year," said Dr Barry. "The incident slipped your memory. War did not render him robust by exer-cising his limbs, as Maurice supposes. He got a shell in the stomach."</p> 
<p>He left them.</p> 
<p>"I think Dr Barry gets cynical," remarked Ada. "I think he's jealous." She was right: Dr Barry, who had been a lady killer in his time, did resent the continuance of young men. Poor Maur-ice encountered him again. He had been saying goodbye to his housemaster's wife, who was a handsome woman, very civil to the older boys. They shook hands warmly. On turning away he heard Dr Barry's "Well, Maurice; a youth irresistible in love as in war," and caught his cynical glance.</p> 
<p>"I don't know what you mean, Dr Barry."</p> 
<p>"Oh, you young fellows! Butter wouldn't melt in your mouth these days. Don't know what I mean! Prudish of a petticoat! Be frank, man, be frank. You don't take anyone in. The frank mind's the pure mind. I'm a medical man and an old man and I tell you</p> 
<p>that. Man that is bom of woman must go with woman if the human race is to continue."</p> 
<p>Maurice stared after the housemaster's wife, underwent a violent repulsion from her, and blushed crimson: he had re-membered Mr Ducie's diagrams. A trouble—nothing as beauti-ful as a sorrow—rose to the surface of his mind, displayed its ungainliness, and sank. Its precise nature he did not ask himself, for his hour was not yet, but the hint was appalling, and, hero though he was, he longed to be a little boy again, and to stroll half awake for ever by the colourless sea. Dr Barry went on lecturing him, and under the cover of a friendly manner said much that gave pain.</p> 
<p>他快要满19岁了。</p> 
<p>在年度颁奖日，他站在讲坛上，背诵着他本人写的希腊文演说稿。讲堂里挤满了学生与家长，莫瑞斯却只当自己是在海牙会议（译注：1899年和1907年在荷兰海牙举行过两次国际会议。第一次会议址未能就其主要目的即限制军备问题达成协议，但签订了和平解决国际争端的公约。第二次会议也未能就限制军备问题达成协议，但会议精神对第一次世界大战后国际联盟的成立大有影响。）上讲话，指出会议精神有多么愚蠢。“哦，欧洲的人们，协议废止战争，这是何等愚蠢的举动！啊？战神阿瑞斯难道不是主神宙斯的儿子吗？况且，战争还会促使你锻炼肢体，身躯健壮，与我的论敌迥然不同。”莫瑞斯的希腊文蹩脚透了，他是凭着有见解而获奖的，如此而已。负责审查的那位教师把他的分数打宽了一些，因为他是个品行端正的毕业生，而且即将升人剑桥。在那里，把作为奖品颁给他的那些书籍排列在书架上，就能帮助本校做宣传。于是，他在雷鸣般的掌声中接受了格罗特（译注：乔治·格罗特1794-1871，英国历史学家，代表作为《希腊史》1846-1856，共12卷）的《希腊史》。当他回到紧挨着母亲的座位上时，就认识到自己重新变得受欢迎，他感到很奇怪。掌声持续下去，甚至为他全场起立喝彩。艾达和吉蒂满脸涨得通红，在尽头接连不断地鼓掌。毕业班的几个同学大声喊着：“演说！”这不符合程序，被主持人制止了。然而，校长本人起身说了几句话：霍尔是他们当中的一个，并且他们会一直这样看待他。他说得恰到好处。学生们并非因为莫瑞斯出类拔萃才为他鼓掌，而是由于他是平庸的。人们可以假借他这个形象来颂扬自己。事后，人们朝着他蜂拥而来，用十分感伤的口吻说：“好极啦，老兄。”甚至感叹道：“你走了以后，这个鬼地方就没意思啦。”他的家族也大沾其光。以往家里人参加学校的活动时，他总对她们表示敌意。一场足球比赛结束后，他满身泥泞，沐浴着胜利的光辉。当母亲和妹妹们跑过来，想跟他待在一起时，他却说：“对不起，妈，您和小家伙们不得不单独走。”那一次，艾达哭了。眼下艾达正干练地跟最高班的班长聊天。有人递给吉蒂一盘蛋糕，他母亲正在倾听舍监的妻子诉说供暖设备不好用。真令人沮丧。每一个人，每一样事物，忽然都协调了。世界就是这样的吗？</p> 
<p>莫瑞斯看见邻居巴里大夫站在不远处。大夫注意到了他，并且用大得吓人的声音喊：“祝贺你的成功，莫瑞斯！我十分感动！为你干这一杯。”他一饮而尽，“令人作呕的茶。”</p> 
<p>莫瑞斯笑了，颇感内疚地朝他踱去。他心中有愧。巴里大夫的一个小侄子上学期入了本校，曾拜托莫瑞斯照顾。然而他什么也没做——没把这个当回事。现在他感到自己是个大人了，懊悔自己当初没有更多的勇气，但为时已晚。</p> 
<p>“那么，你这辉煌的生涯中，下一个舞台在哪儿？剑桥吗？”</p> 
<p>“他们这么说。”</p> 
<p>“他们这么说，是吗？你怎么说呢？”</p> 
<p>“我不知道。”今天的英雄和蔼可亲地说。</p> 
<p>“剑桥之后怎样呢？证券交易所吗？”</p> 
<p>“我料想是这样。我父亲的老搭档说，如果一切顺利，就让我参加。”</p> 
<p>“你父亲的老搭档让你参加后又怎样呢？娶一个漂亮的妻子？”</p> 
<p>莫瑞斯又笑了。</p> 
<p>“她将送给满怀期待的世界一位莫瑞斯三世吧？接着迎来老境、儿孙，最后是长满雏菊的坟墓。这就是你对事业的见解，我的见解不是这样的。”</p> 
<p>“您的见解是怎样的呢？”吉蒂大声说。</p> 
<p>“帮助弱者，纠正谬误，亲爱的。”他朝她望过去，回答说。</p> 
<p>“我相信这是我们大家的见解。”舍监的妻子说，霍尔太太表示同意。</p> 
<p>“啊，不，不是的。我也并非一贯如此，否则的话，我该去照料我的迪基，而不是继续在这豪华的场所待下去。”</p> 
<p>“请务必把亲爱的迪基带到我们家来玩玩。他爸爸也来了吗？”霍尔太太问。</p> 
<p>“妈妈！”吉蒂悄声说。</p> 
<p>“我弟弟去年去世了，”巴里大夫说。“您是贵人善忘。战争并没像莫瑞斯所设想的那样锻炼他的肢体，使他身躯健壮。他的腹部中了一颗子弹。”</p> 
<p>他扬长而去。</p> 
<p>“我认为巴里大夫变得玩世不恭了。”艾达发表了意见。“我认为他这是妒忌。”她说得一点不错。当年巴里大夫曾经是个使女人倾心的男人，年轻人后浪推前浪地拥上来，他感到不满。倒霉的莫瑞斯再度碰见了他。莫瑞斯正向舍监的妻子告别。她是个俏丽的女人，对高班男生礼数周到。他们热情地握手。莫瑞斯掉头而去的时候，听见巴里大夫说：“喏，莫瑞斯，风华正茂，不论在情场上还是在战场上，都是不可抗拒的。”于是，他的视线与大夫那嘲讽的目光相遇。</p> 
<p>“我不明白您的意思，巴里大夫。”</p> 
<p>“哦，你们这些年轻人！装出一副一本正经的样子。不明白我的意思！在姑娘面前过分拘谨！开诚布公，小伙子，开诚布公。你什么人也欺骗不了。开诚布公的心灵是纯洁的心灵。我是个医生，上了年纪，我告诉你这一点。男人是女人所生的，为了让人类继续存在下去，就必须跟女人同步而行。”</p> 
<p>莫瑞斯凝视着舍监太太的背影，对她产生了强烈的厌恶感，满脸涨得通红。他记起了杜希先生画的那些示意图。一种苦恼——没有悲哀那么美——浮到他的意识表层，显示了一下它有多么丑陋，又沉下去。他并不曾问自己它的真面目，因为还没到时候。然而，旁人对他所做的暗示把他弄得毛骨悚然。尽管他是一位英雄，却渴望自己重新变成一个小男孩，永远半睡半醒地沿着无色的海洋徜徉。巴里大夫继续对他进行说教，大夫装出一副友好的样子，说了许许多多刺痛他的话。</p>
