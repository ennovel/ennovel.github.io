Maurice came to see him as he was recovering, caught it, and went to bed himself. Thus they saw little of one another for several weeks, and when they did meet Clive was still white and nervy. He came down to the Halls', preferring their house to Pippa's, and hoping that the good food and quiet would set him up. He ate little, and when he spoke his theme was the futility of all things.</p> 
<p>"I'm a barrister because I may enter public life," he said in reply to a question of Ada's. "But why should I enter public life? Who wants me?"</p> 
<p>"Your mother says the county does."</p> 
<p>"If the county wants anyone it wants a Radical. But I've talked to more people than my mother, and they're weary of us leisured classes coasting round in motor-cars and asking for something to do. All this solemn to and fro between great houses —it's a game without gaiety. You don't find it played outside England. (Maurice, I'm going to Greece.) No one wants us, or anything except a comfortable home."</p> 
<p>"But to give a comfortable home's what public life is," shrilled Kitty.</p> 
<p>"Is, or ought to be?"</p> 
<p>"Well, it's all the same."</p> 
<p>"Is and ought to be are not the same," said her mother, proud of grasping the distinction. "You ought to be not interrupting Mr Durham, whereas you—"</p> 
<p>"—is," supplied Ada, and the family laugh made Clive jump.</p> 
<p>"We are and we ought to be," concluded Mrs Hall. "Very dif-ferent."</p> 
<p>"Not always," contradicted Clive.</p> 
<p>"Not always, remember that, Kitty," she echoed, vaguely ad-monitory: on other occasions he had not minded her. Kitty cried back to her first assertion. Ada was saying anything, Maurice nothing. He was eating away placidly, too used to such table talk to see that it worried his friend. Between the courses he told an anecdote. All were silent to listen to him. He spoke slowly, stupidly, without attending to his words or taking the trouble to be interesting. Suddenly Clive cut in with "I say— I'm going to faint," and fell off his chair.</p> 
<p>"Get a pillow, Kitty: Ada, eau de cologne," said their brother. He loosened Clive's collar. "Mother, fan him; no; fan him . . ."</p> 
<p>"Silly it is," murmured Clive.</p> 
<p>As he spoke, Maurice kissed him.</p> 
<p>"I'm all right now."</p> 
<p>The girls and a servant came running in.</p> 
<p>"I can walk," he said, the colour returning to his face.</p> 
<p>"Certainly not," cried Mrs Hall. "Maurice'U carry you—Mr Durham, put your arms round Maurice."</p> 
<p>"Come along, old man. The doctor: somebody telephone." He picked up his friend, who was so weak that he began to cry.</p> 
<p>"Maurice—I'm a fool."</p> 
<p>"Be a fool," said Maurice, and carried him upstairs, undressed him, and put him to bed. Mrs Hall knocked, and going out to her he said quickly, "Mother, you needn't tell the others I kissed Durham."</p> 
<p>"Oh, certainly not."</p> 
<p>"He wouldn't like it. I was rather upset and did it without thinking. As you know, we are great friends, relations almost."</p> 
<p>It sufficed. She liked to have little secrets with her son; it re-minded her of the time when she had been so much to him. Ada joined them with a hot water bottle, which he took in to the patient.</p> 
<p>"The doctor'll see me like this," Clive sobbed.</p> 
<p>"I hope he will."</p> 
<p>"Why?"</p> 
<p>Maurice lit a cigarette, and sat on the edge of the bed. "We want him to see you at your worst. Why did Pippa let you travel?"</p> 
<p>"I was supposed to be well."</p> 
<p>"Hell take you."</p> 
<p>"Can we come in?" called Ada through the door.</p> 
<p>"No. Send the doctor alone."</p> 
<p>"He's here," cried Kitty in the distance. A man, little older than themselves, was announced.</p> 
<p>"Hullo, Jowitt," said Maurice, rising. "Just cure me this chap. He's had influenza, and is supposed to be well. Result he's fainted, and can't stop crying."</p> 
<p>"We know all about that," remarked Mr Jowitt, and stuck a thermometer into Clive's mouth. "Been working hard?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, and now wants to go to Greece."</p> 
<p>"So he shall. You clear out now. I'll see you downstairs."</p> 
<p>Maurice obeyed, convinced that Clive was seriously ill. Jowitt followed in about ten minutes, and told Mrs Hall it was nothing much—a bad relapse. He wrote prescriptions, and said he would send in a nurse. Maurice followed him into the garden, and, laying a hand on his arm, said, "Now tell me how ill he is. This isn't a relapse. It's something more. Please tell me the truth."</p> 
<p>"He'sall right," said the other; somewhat annoyed, for he</p> 
<p>piqued himself on telling the truth. "I thought you realized that. He's stopped the hysteria and is getting off to sleep. It's just an ordinary relapse. He will have to be more careful this time than the other, that's all."</p> 
<p>"And how long will these ordinary relapses, as you call them, go on? At any moment may he have this appalling pain?"</p> 
<p>"He's only a bit uncomfortable—caught a chill in the car, he thinks."</p> 
<p>"Jowitt, you don't tell me. A grown man doesn't cry, unless he's gone pretty far."</p> 
<p>"That is only the weakness."</p> 
<p>"Oh, give it your own name," said Maurice, removing his hand. "Besides, I'm keeping you."</p> 
<p>"Not a bit, my young friend, I'm here to answer any difficul-ties."</p> 
<p>"Well, if it's so slight, why are you sending in a nurse?"</p> 
<p>"To amuse him. I understand he's well off."</p> 
<p>"And can't we amuse him?"</p> 
<p>"No, because of the infection. You were there when I told your mother none of you ought to go into the room."</p> 
<p>"I thought you meant my sisters."</p> 
<p>"You equally—more, for you've already caught it from him once."</p> 
<p>"I won't have a nurse."</p> 
<p>"Mrs Hall has telephoned to the Institute."</p> 
<p>"Why is everything done in such a damned hurry?" said Maurice, raising his voice. "I shall nurse him myself."</p> 
<p>"Have you wheeling the baby next."</p> 
<p>"I beg your pardon?"</p> 
<p>Jowitt went off laughing.</p> 
<p>In tones that admitted no argument Maurice told his mother he should sleep in the patient's room. He would not have a bed</p> 
<p>taken in, lest Clive woke up, but lay down on the floor with his head on a foot-stool, and read by the rays of a candle lamp. Before long Clive stirred and said feebly, "Oh damnation, oh damnation."</p> 
<p>"Want anything?" Maurice called.</p> 
<p>"My inside's all wrong."</p> 
<p>Maurice lifted him out of bed and put him on the night stool. When relief had come he lifted him back.</p> 
<p>"I can walk: you mustn't do this sort of thing."</p> 
<p>"You'd do it for me."</p> 
<p>He carried the stool down the passage and cleaned it. Now that Clive was undignified and weak, he loved him as never before.</p> 
<p>"You mustn't," repeated Clive, when he came back. "It's too filthy."</p> 
<p>"Doesn't worry me," said Maurice, lying down. "Get off to sleep again."</p> 
<p>"The doctor told me he'd send a nurse."</p> 
<p>"What do you want with a nurse? It's only a touch of diar-rhoea. You can keep on all night as far as I'm concerned. Hon-estly it doesn't worry me—I don't say this to please you. It just doesn't."</p> 
<p>"I can't possibly—your office—"</p> 
<p>"Look here, Clive, would you rather have a trained nurse or me? One's coming tonight, but I left word she was to be sent away again, because I'd rather chuck the office and look after you myself, and thought you'd rather."</p> 
<p>Clive was silent so long that Maurice thought him asleep. At last he sighed, "I suppose I'd better have the nurse."</p> 
<p>"Right: she will make you more comfortable than I can. Per-haps you're right."</p> 
<p>Clive made no reply.</p> 
<p>Ada had volunteered to sit up in the room below, and, accord-ing to arrangement, Maurice tapped three times, and while waiting for her studied Clive's blurred and sweaty face. It was useless the doctor talking: his friend was in agony. He longed to embrace him, but remembered this had brought on the hys-teria, and besides, Clive was restrained, fastidious almost. As Ada did not come he went downstairs, and found that she had fallen asleep. She lay, the picture of health, in a big leather chair, with her hands dropped on either side and her feet stretched out. Her bosom rose and fell, her heavy black hair served as a cushion to her face, and between her lips he saw teeth and a scarlet tongue. "Wake up," he cried irritably.</p> 
<p>Ada woke.</p> 
<p>"How do you expect to hear the front door when the nurse comes?"</p> 
<p>"How is poor Mr Durham?"</p> 
<p>"Very ill; dangerously ill."</p> 
<p>"Oh Maurice! Maurice!"</p> 
<p>"The nurse is to stop. I called you, but you never came. Go off to bed now, as you can't even help that much."</p> 
<p>"Mother said I must sit up, because the nurse mustn't be let in by a man—it wouldn't look well."</p> 
<p>"I can't think how you have time to think of such rubbish," said Maurice.</p> 
<p>"We must keep the house a good name."</p> 
<p>He was silent, then laughed in the way the girls disliked. At the bottom of their hearts they disliked him entirely, but were too confused mentally to know this. His laugh was the only grievance they avowed.</p> 
<p>"Nurses are not nice. No nice girl would be a nurse. If they are you may be sure they do not come from nice homes, or they would stop at home."</p> 
<p>"Ada, how long were you at school?" asked her brother, as he helped himself to a drink.</p> 
<p>"I call going to school stopping at home."</p> 
<p>He set down his glass with a clank, and left her. Clive's eyes were open, but he did not speak or seem to know that Maurice had returned, nor did the coming of the nurse arouse him.</p> 
<p>克莱夫顺利地通过了出庭辩护律师的考试，然而在取得资格之前，患了轻微的流行性感冒，发起烧来。进入恢复期后，莫瑞斯去探望他时被传染上了，也卧病在床。这样一来，他们二人几个星期没怎么见面。后来好不容易见到了，克莱夫依然脸色苍白，神经紧张。跟皮帕家相比，他更喜欢霍尔家，所以前来小住，希望合口味的食品与安宁会使自己康复。他吃得很少，三句话不离“干什么都是白搭”。</p> 
<p>“我做一名出庭辩护律师，为的是将来可能当政治家。”他这么回答艾达向他提的问题。“然而，我当政治家干吗？谁要我呢？”</p> 
<p>“你母亲说，全郡居民要你。”</p> 
<p>“全郡居民所要的是个激进党派成员。比起我母亲来，我跟更多的人谈过话。他们对咱们闲居阶级已经不感兴趣了。咱们坐着汽车去转悠，找事做。装腔作势地在各座大宅门之间串来串去，玩的是一场没有欢乐的游戏。除了在英国，没有人这么玩。（莫瑞斯，我要到希腊去。）谁都不需要我们，他们所需要的只是个舒适的家庭而已。”</p> 
<p>“但是，政治家正在提供舒适的家庭。”吉蒂尖锐刺耳地说。</p> 
<p>“是‘正在’呢，还是‘应该’呢？”</p> 
<p>“喏，这完全是一码事。”</p> 
<p>…正在’和‘应该’可不是一码事。”艾达的母亲说，由于理解了二者的不同，她很得意。“你们不应该打扰德拉姆先生，你们却……”</p> 
<p>…正在’。”艾达从旁插嘴，全家人大笑，惹得克莱夫跳了起来。</p> 
<p>…正在’和‘应该’，”霍尔太太做出结论，“是截然不同的。”</p> 
<p>“未必是这样。”克莱夫反驳道。</p> 
<p>“未必是这样。你可要记住，吉蒂。”她随声附和，稍微带点儿训斥的口吻。其他时候他并不在乎她说什么。吉蒂仍大声坚称二者是一码事。艾达念念有词，莫瑞斯默不作声。他一向安静地进食，对饭桌上的这种饶舌已习以为常，没有理会他的朋友竟给弄得心烦意乱。等着上菜的时候，他讲了一桩趣闻。大家都默默地倾听。他慢条斯理、笨嘴拙舌地讲着，既不注意措词，也不费心去讲得饶有趣味。克莱夫忽然喊了一声：“啊——我要晕倒啦！”就从椅子上跌下去了。</p> 
<p>“拿个枕头来，吉蒂。艾达，科隆香水。”她们的哥哥吩咐道。他松开了克莱夫的领口。“妈，扇扇。不是我，是他……”</p> 
<p>“多么不中用啊……”克莱夫喃喃地说，话音未落，莫瑞斯吻了他一下。</p> 
<p>“这会儿我完全好了。”</p> 
<p>姑娘们和一个仆人跑了进来。</p> 
<p>“我能走路啦。”他说，他的脸恢复了血色。</p> 
<p>“绝没有好。”霍尔太太叫喊。“莫瑞斯抱你去——德拉姆先生，用胳膊搂住莫瑞斯．”</p> 
<p>“来吧，老兄。请大夫，谁去打个电话。”他抱起朋友，克莱夫虚弱地哭泣起来。</p> 
<p>“莫瑞斯，我是个蠢材。”</p> 
<p>“就做个蠢材好了。”莫瑞斯说，并把克莱夫抱上楼去，替他脱衣服，让他唾在床上。霍尔太太敲了敲门，他迎出去，快嘴快舌地说：“妈，您不必告诉旁人我吻过德拉姆。”</p> 
<p>“哦，当然不告诉。”</p> 
<p>“他不喜欢这样。我六神无主，连想都没想一下就这么做了。您知道，我们是挚友，几乎是亲戚。”</p> 
<p>这就够了。她喜欢与儿子分享一些小秘密，这使她忆起过去的岁月，对他而言，那时她曾是无上宝贵的。艾达送来了一个热水袋。他接住，进屋拎到病人床头。</p> 
<p>“让大夫瞧见我这副德行。”克莱夫呜咽地说。</p> 
<p>“我但愿他能瞧见。”</p> 
<p>“为什么？”</p> 
<p>莫瑞斯点燃一支香烟，坐在床边上。“我们要他看看你最糟糕的样子。为什么皮帕让你去旅行？”</p> 
<p>“我被认为已经康复了。”</p> 
<p>“见鬼。”</p> 
<p>“我们能进去吗？”艾达隔着门大声问道。</p> 
<p>“不能。请大夫一个人进来。”</p> 
<p>“他就在这儿。”吉蒂在远处叫喊。报过名字后，一个比他们大不了多少的人进来了。</p> 
<p>“你好，乔伊特。”莫瑞斯边起身边招呼。“替我把这家伙治好了吧。他患了流行性感冒，被认为已经痊愈了。结果晕倒了，一个劲儿地哭。”</p> 
<p>“这是常有的情况。”乔伊特先生说，并把一支体温计插到克莱夫嘴里。“是不是劳累过度呢？”</p> 
<p>“可不是嘛。如今说是想去希腊。”</p> 
<p>“啊，可以去。现在你先出去吧，待会儿我到楼下去见你。”</p> 
<p>莫瑞斯听从了他的话，克莱夫想必病得很重。过了大约十分钟，乔伊特出来了，并告诉霍尔太太没什么大不了的——旧病复发而已。他开了处方，说要派个护士来。莫瑞斯尾随他到庭园里，将手放在大夫的胳膊上说：“现在告诉我，他病得多么厉害。这不是旧病复发，还有什么其他的，请告诉我真实情况。”</p> 
<p>“他不要紧的。”大夫说。他一向以说实话而自负，所以弄得有些心烦。“我以为你已经领悟了这一点。癔病不再发作了，他快要入睡了。这是司空见惯的旧病复发，这一次他可得比上一次当心，如此而已。”</p> 
<p>“你所说的这种司空见惯的旧病复发会拖延多久呢？他是不是随时都可能遭受这种骇人的痛苦呢？”</p> 
<p>“他只不过是有点儿不舒服——他认为是在车子里患上了感冒。”</p> 
<p>“乔伊特，你别对我这么说。一个成年人是不会哭的，除非已经相当严重了。”</p> 
<p>“只不过是虚弱罢了。”</p> 
<p>“哦，你怎么说都行，”莫瑞斯边说边把手移开。“而且我正在耽搁你。”</p> 
<p>“一点儿关系也没有，我的年轻朋友，我等着解答你的任何难胚。”</p> 
<p>“喏，倘若病情轻，你为什么派护士来呢？”</p> 
<p>“好让他开心呗。我知道他手头宽裕。”</p> 
<p>“难道我们就不能让他开心吗？”</p> 
<p>“哪里的话。因为怕传染啊。我曾告诉过你母亲，你们都不应该走进病房，可那时你已经待在里边了。”</p> 
<p>“我还以为你指的是我的妹妹们呢。”</p> 
<p>“你也一样——尤其是你，因为你已经被他传染过一次了。”</p> 
<p>“我不要护士。”</p> 
<p>“霍尔太太已经给护士站打电话了。”</p> 
<p>“为什么一切都他妈的赶成这个样子？”莫瑞斯提高了嗓门说，“我自个儿护理他。”</p> 
<p>“下一步你就该把孩子放在婴儿车里推着走了。”</p> 
<p>“请问，你说什么？”</p> 
<p>乔伊特放声大笑，扬长而去。</p> 
<p>莫瑞斯用不容置疑的口吻告诉母亲，他必须睡在病房里。由于怕吵醒克莱夫，他没让人把床搬进去，却头枕脚凳，卧在地板上，借着烛光读书。过一会儿，克莱夫蠕动起来，有气无力地说：“啊，该死。啊，该死。”</p> 
<p>“你要什么？”莫瑞斯呼唤道。</p> 
<p>“我闹肚子啦。”</p> 
<p>莫瑞斯把他从床上抱下来，扶他坐在便桶上。不一会儿，又将他抱回去。</p> 
<p>“我能走路。你不该做这种事。”</p> 
<p>“你也会为我这么做的。”</p> 
<p>他把便桶端到走廊尽头，冲洗干净。现在克莱夫既不体面又虚弱，他比任何时候都爱这个朋友。</p> 
<p>“你不应该这样。”当他回来的时候，克莱夫把话重复了一遍。“太脏了。”</p> 
<p>“我才不在乎呢。”莫瑞斯边躺下去边说，“再接着睡吧。”</p> 
<p>“大夫告诉我，他要派个护士来。”</p> 
<p>“你要护士干吗？只不过是轻微的腹泻而已。就我而言，你可以整宿泻个不停。老实说，我并不在乎——我不是为了使你高兴才这么说的。我就是不在乎。”</p> 
<p>“我总不能——你还得去上班呢——”</p> 
<p>“喂，克莱夫，你是宁愿要一位熟练的护士，还是要我呢？今天晚上预定来一位，可我已经留下话，来了就把她打发走。因为我情愿不去上班，自个儿照看你。我还认为你也愿意这样呢。”</p> 
<p>克莱夫沉默良久，莫瑞斯甚至以为他睡着了。他终于叹了口气说：“我想，还是宁可要护士。”</p> 
<p>“好的。她比我更能使你舒适一些。也许你是对的。”</p> 
<p>克莱夫没有回答。</p> 
<p>艾达自告奋勇在楼下的房间里守夜，莫瑞斯就按照预先谈好的敲了三下地板。等候她上楼的时候，他审视着克莱夫那张模糊不清、汗津津的脸。大夫那么说也是白搭，他的朋友苦恼不堪。他很想拥抱克莱夫，却又想起那曾使克莱夫的癔病发作，何况克莱夫一向是有所克制的，几乎到了洁癖的程度。艾达没有来，他就下楼去了，发现她睡得正熟。她躺在一把大皮椅上，双臂耷拉下来，伸出两只脚．俨然是健康的化身。她的胸脯一起一伏，浓密乌黑的头发充当了面庞的靠垫，嘴唇略启，露出皓齿与鲜红的舌头。“醒一醒。”他急躁地喊叫。</p> 
<p>艾达醒过来了。</p> 
<p>“像你这样，护士来的时候，你怎么听得见大门的响动呢？”</p> 
<p>“可怜的德拉姆先生怎么样啦？”</p> 
<p>“病得很重，病到危险的程度。”</p> 
<p>“哦，莫瑞斯！莫瑞斯！”</p> 
<p>“护士嘛，得留下来。我叫你来着，可你总也不来。去睡吧，因为你连这么一点儿忙也帮不上。”</p> 
<p>“妈妈说我必须守夜。因为护士不应该由男人领进去——那不雅观。”</p> 
<p>“我简直不能想象你们居然有时间考虑这么无聊的事。”莫瑞斯说。</p> 
<p>“我们必须维护家庭的好名声。”</p> 
<p>他没吭声，接着以妹妹们厌恶的样子笑了。她们的内心深处极不喜欢他。然而她们思想太混乱，并不曾觉察出这一点。她们惟一公开抱怨的是他这种笑法。</p> 
<p>“护士没有教养，任何有教养的姑娘都不会去当护士。即使她们本人有教养，你也能肯定她们不是出身于有教养的家庭，否则她们会待在家里。”</p> 
<p>“艾达，你上过几年学校？”哥哥一边斟酒一边问。</p> 
<p>“我把上学叫做待在家里。”</p> 
<p>他“咔嗒”一声将玻璃杯放下来，离开了她。克莱夫睁着眼睛，却没有说话，好像也不知道莫瑞斯已经回来了。甚至护士抵达，也没使他苏醒。</p>
