<p>Dedicated to a Happier Year</p> 
<p>PART</p> 
<p>Once a term the whole school went for a walk—that is to say the three masters took part as well as all the boys. It was usually a pleasant outing, and everyone looked for-ward to it, forgot old scores, and behaved with freedom. Lest discipline should suffer, it took place just before the holidays, when leniency does no harm, and indeed it seemed more like a treat at home than school, for Mrs Abrahams, the Principal's wife, would meet them at the tea place with some lady friends, and be hospitable and motherly.</p> 
<p>Mr Abrahams was a preparatory schoolmaster of the old-fash-ioned sort. He cared neither for work nor games, but fed his boys well and saw that they did not misbehave. The rest he left to the parents, and did not speculate how much the parents were leaving to him. Amid mutual compliments the boys passed out into a public school, healthy but backward, to receive upon un-defended flesh the first blows of the world. There is much to be said for apathy in education, and Mr Abrahams's pupils did not do badly in the long run, became parents in their turn, and in some cases sent him their sons. Mr Read, the junior assistant, was a master of the same type, only stupider, while Mr Ducie, the senior, acted as a stimulant, and prevented the whole concern from going to sleep. They did not like him much, but knew that he was necessary. Mr Ducie was an able man, orthodox, but not out of touch with the world, nor incapable of seeing both sides</p> 
<p>of a question. He was unsuitable for parents and the denser boys, but good for the first form, and had even coached pupils into a scholarship. Nor was he a bad organizer. While affecting to hold the reins and to prefer Mr Read, Mr Abrahams really allowed Mr Ducie a free hand and ended by taking him into partnership. Mr Ducie always had something on his mind. On this occasion it was Hall, one of the older boys, who was leaving them to go to a public school. He wanted to have a "good talk" with Hall, during the outing. His colleagues objected, since it would leave them more to do, and the Principal remarked that he had already talked to Hall, and that the boy would prefer to take his last walk with his school-fellows. This was probable, but Mr Ducie was never deterred from doing what is right. He smiled and was si-lent. Mr Read knew what the "good talk" would be, for early in their acquaintance they had touched on a certain theme profes-sionally. Mr Read had disapproved. "Thin ice," he had said. The Principal neither knew nor would have wished to know. Parting from his pupils when they were fourteen, he forgot they had de-veloped into men. They seemed to him a race small but com-plete, like the New Guinea pygmies, "my boys". And they were even easier to understand than pygmies, because they never married and seldom died. Celibate and immortal, the long pro-cession passed before him, its thickness varying from twenty-five to forty at a time. "I see no use in books on education. Boys be-gan before education was thought of." Mr Ducie would smile, for he was soaked in evolution.</p> 
<p>From this to the boys.</p> 
<p>"Sir, may I hold your hand.... Sir, you promised me...Both Mr. Abrahams's hands were bagged and all Mr Read's. ... Oh sir, did you hear that? He thinks Mr Read has three hands! . .. I didn't, I said 'fingers'. Green eye! Green eye!"</p> 
<p>"When you have quite finished—!"</p> 
<p>"Sir!"</p> 
<p>"I'm going to walk with Hall alone."</p> 
<p>There were cries of disappointment. The other masters, seeing that it was no good, called the pack off, and marshalled them along the cliff towards the downs. Hall, triumphant, sprang to Mr Ducie's side, and felt too old to take his hand. He was a plump, pretty lad, not in any way remarkable. In this he resem-bled his father, who had passed in the procession twenty-five years before, vanished into a public school, married, begotten a son and two daughters, and recently died of pneumonia. Mr Hall had been a good citizen, but lethargic. Mr Ducie had in-formed himself about him before they began the walk.</p> 
<p>"Well, Hall, expecting a pi-jaw, eh?"</p> 
<p>"I don't know, sir—Mr Abrahams' given me one with 'Those Holy Fields'. Mrs Abrahams' given me sleeve links. The fellows have given me a set of Guatemalas up to two dollars. Look, sir! The ones with the parrot on the pillar on."</p> 
<p>"Splendid, splendid! What did Mr Abrahams say? Told you you were a miserable sinner, I hope."</p> 
<p>The boy laughed. He did not understand Mr Ducie, but knew that he was meaning to be funny. He felt at ease because it was his last day at school, and even if he did wrong he would not get into a row. Besides, Mr Abrahams had declared him a success. "We are proud of him; he will do us honour at Sunnington": he had seen the beginning of the letter to his mother. And the boys had showered presents on him, declaring he was brave. A great mistake—he wasn't brave: he was afraid of the dark. But no one knew this.</p> 
<p>"Well, what did Mr Abrahams say?" repeated Mr Ducie, when they reached the sands. A long talk threatened, and the boy wished he was up on the cliff with his friends, but he knew that wishing is useless when boy meets man.</p> 
<p>"Mr Abrahams told me to copy my father, sir."</p> 
<p>"Anything else?"</p> 
<p>"I am never to do anything I should be ashamed to have mother see me do. No one can go wrong then, and the public school will be very different from this."</p> 
<p>"Did Mr Abrahams say how?"</p> 
<p>"All kinds of difficulties—more like the world."</p> 
<p>"Did he tell you what the world is like?"</p> 
<p>"No."</p> 
<p>"Did you ask him?"</p> 
<p>"No, sir."</p> 
<p>"That wasn't very sensible of you, Hall. Clear things up. Mr Abrahams and I are here to answer your questions. What do you suppose the world—the world of grown-up people is like?"</p> 
<p>"I can't tell. I'm a boy," he said, very sincerely. "Are they very treacherous, sir?"</p> 
<p>Mr Ducie was amused and asked him what examples of treachery he had seen. He replied that grown-up people would not be unkind to boys, but were they not always cheating one another? Losing his schoolboy manner, he began to talk like a child, and became fanciful and amusing. Mr Ducie lay down on the sand to listen to him, lit his pipe, and looked up to the sky. The little watering-place where they lived was now far behind, the rest of the school away in front. The day was gray and wind-less, with little distinction between clouds and sun.</p> 
<p>"You live with your mother, don't you?" he interrupted, seeing that the boy had gained confidence.</p> 
<p>"Yes, sir."</p> 
<p>"Have you any elder brothers?"</p> 
<p>"No, sir—only Ada and Kitty."</p> 
<p>"Any uncles?"</p> 
<p>"No."</p> 
<p>"So you don't know many men?"</p> 
<p>"Mother keeps a coachman and George in the garden, but of course you mean gentlemen. Mother has three maid-servants tolook after the house, but they are so idle that they will not mend Ada's stockings. Ada is my eldest little sister."</p> 
<p>"How old are you?"</p> 
<p>"Fourteen and three quarters."</p> 
<p>"Well, you're an ignorant little beggar." They laughed. After a pause he said, "When I was your age, my father told me some-thing that proved very useful and helped me a good deal." This was untrue: his father had never told him anything. But he needed a prelude to what he was going to say.</p> 
<p>"Did he, sir?"</p> 
<p>"Shall I tell you what it was?"</p> 
<p>"Please, sir."</p> 
<p>"I am going to talk to you for a few moments as if I were your father, Maurice! I shall call you by your real name." Then, very simply and kindly, he approached the mystery of sex. He spoke of male and female, created by God in the beginning in orderthat the earth might be peopled, and of the period when the male and female receive their powers. "You are just becoming a man now, Maurice; that is why I am telling you about this. It is not a thing that your mother can tell you, and you should not mention it to her nor to any lady, and if at your next school boys mention it to you, just shut them up; tell them you know. Have you heard about it before?"</p> 
<p>"No, sir."</p> 
<p>"Not a word?"</p> 
<p>"No, sir."</p> 
<p>Still smoking his pipe, Mr Ducie got up, and choosing a smooth piece of sand drew diagrams upon it with his walking-stick. "This will make it easier," he said to the boy, who watched dully: it bore no relation to his experiences. He was attentive, as</p> 
<p>was natural when he was the only one in the class, and he knew that the subject was serious and related to his own body. But he could not himself relate it; it fell to pieces as soon as Mr Ducie put it together, like an impossible sum. In vain he tried. His torpid brain would not awake. Puberty was there, but not intel-ligence, and manhood was stealing on him, as it always must, in a trance. Useless to break in upon that trance. Useless to describe it, however scientifically and sympathetically. The boy assents and is dragged back into sleep, not to be enticed there before his hour.</p> 
<p>Mr Ducie, whatever his science, was sympathetic. Indeed he was too sympathetic; he attributed cultivated feelings to Mau-rice, and did not realize that he must either understand nothing or be overwhelmed. "All this is rather a bother," he said, 'Taut one must get it over, one mustn't make a mystery of it. Then come the great things—Love, Life." He was fluent, having talked to boys in this way before, and he knew the kind of question they would ask. Maurice would not ask: he only said, "I see, I see, I see," and at first Mr Ducie feared he did not see. He ex-amined him. The replies were satisfactory. They boy's memory was good and—so curious a fabric is the human—he even de-veloped a spurious intelligence, a surface flicker to respond to the beaconing glow of the man's. In the end he did ask one or two questions about sex, and they were to the point. Mr Ducie was much pleased. "That's right," he said. "You need never be puzzled or bothered now."</p> 
<p>Love and life still remained, and he touched on them as they strolled forward by the colourless sea. He spoke of the ideal man —chaste with asceticism. He sketched the glory of Woman. En-gaged to be married himself, he grew more human, and his eyes coloured up behind the strong spectacles; his cheek flushed. To love a noble woman, to protect and serve her—this, he told the</p> 
<p>little boy, was the crown of life. "You can't understand now, you will some day, and when you do understand it, remember the poor old pedagogue who put you on the track. It all hangs to-gether—all—and God's in his heaven, All's right with the world. Male and female! Ah wonderful!"</p> 
<p>"I think I shall not marry," remarked Maurice.</p> 
<p>"This day ten years hence—I invite you and your wife to din-ner with my wife and me. Will you accept?"</p> 
<p>"Oh sir!" He smiled with pleasure.</p> 
<p>"It's a bargain, then!" It was at all events a good joke to end with. Maurice was nattered and began to contemplate marriage. But while they were easing off Mr Ducie stopped, and held his cheek as though every tooth ached. He turned and looked at the long expanse of sand behind.</p> 
<p>"I never scratched out those infernal diagrams," he said slowly.</p> 
<p>At the further end of the bay some people were following them, also by the edge of the sea. Their course would take them by the very spot where Mr Ducie had illustrated sex, and one of them was a lady. He ran back sweating with fear.</p> 
<p>"Sir, won't it be all right?" Maurice cried. "The tide'll have covered them by now."</p> 
<p>"Good Heavens ... thank God ... the tide's rising."</p> 
<p>And suddenly for an instant of time, the boy despised him. "Liar," he thought. "Liar, coward, he's told me nothing." . . . Then darkness rolled up again, the darkness that is primeval but not eternal, and yields to its own painful dawn.</p> 
<p>1913年动笔</p> 
<p>1914年完稿</p> 
<p>献给更幸福的一年</p> 
<p>全校——也就是说，三位教师和所有的学生每个学期出去散步一次。那通常是令人愉悦的郊游，每个人都企盼着，将分数抛在脑后，无拘无束。为了避免扰乱纪律，总在临放假之前组织，这个时候即便放纵一些也不碍事。与其说仍在学校，倒好像是在家里接受款待，因为校长夫人亚伯拉罕太太会偕同几位女友在喝茶的地方跟他们相聚，热情好客，像慈母一样。</p> 
<p>亚伯拉罕先生是—位旧脑筋的私立预备学校校长。功课也罢，体育活动也罢，他一概不放在心上，只顾让学生吃好，防止他们品行不端。其他的就听任学生的父母去管了，从未顾及过家长多么信任他。校方和家长相互恭维着，那些身体健康、学业落后的学生们遂升入公学（译注：公学是英国独立的中等学校，由私人资助和管理，培养准备升入大学的学生。学生主要来自上等阶层和富裕的中等阶层家庭。），世道朝着他们那毫无防备的肉体猛击一拳。教学不力这一点，大有讨论的余地，从长远来看，亚伯拉罕先生的学生们并不怎么差劲儿。轮到他们做父亲后，有的还把儿子送到母校来。副教务主任里德是同一个类型的教师，只是更愚蠢一些。而教务主任杜希，却是本校的一副兴奋剂，使得全盘的教育方针不至于沉闷。那两个人不怎么喜欢他，但却知道他是不可或缺的。杜希先生是一位干练的教师，正统的教育家，既懂得人情世故，又有本事从两方面来看问题。他不善于跟家长周旋，也不适宜跟迟钝的学生打交道，却擅长教一年级。他把学生们培养成热爱读书的人，他的组织能力也不赖。亚伯拉罕先生表面上掌权，并做出一副偏爱里德先生的样子，骨子里却任凭杜希先生处理一切，到头来还让他做了共同经营者。</p> 
<p>杜希先生老是惦念着什么。这次是高班的一个名叫霍尔的学生，不久就要跟他们告别，升人公学。他想在郊游的时候跟霍尔“畅谈”一番。他的同事们表示异议，因为事后会给他们添麻烦。校长说他们已经谈过话了，况且霍尔宁愿和同学们在一起，因为这是他最后一次散步。很可能是如此，然而凡是正当的事，杜希先生素来是一不做，二不休。他面泛微笑，一声不响。里德先生知道他要“畅谈”什么。因为他们初结识之际，在交流教育的经验时触及过一个问题。当时，里德先生反对杜希先生的意见，说那是“如履薄冰”。校长并不知道此事，他也不愿意知道。他那帮学生长到十四岁就离开他了，他忘记他们已经长成男子汉了。对他来说，他们好像是小型而完整的种族一“我的学生”，不啻是新几内亚的俾格米人（译注：俾格米人是现代人类学术语，专指男性平均身高不足150厘米的人种）。他们比俾格米人还容易理解，因为他们决不结婚，轻易不会死掉。这些单身汉是永生的，排成一字长队从他面前经过，数目不等，少则二十五名，多则四十名。“依我看，关于教育学的书没有用处，还没产生‘教育’这个概念的时候，孩子们就已经这样了。”杜希先生听罢，一笑置之，因为他专心研究进化论。</p> 
<p>那么，学生们又如何呢？</p> 
<p>“老师，我能拉着您的手吗？……老师，您答应过我的……亚伯拉罕老师的两只手都腾不出来。里德老师的手全都……啊，老师，您听见了吗？他以为里德老师有三只手呢！……我没那么说，我说的是‘指头’。吃醋喽！吃醋喽！”</p> 
<p>“你们说完了吧！”</p> 
<p>“老师！”</p> 
<p>“我只跟霍尔一个人走。”</p> 
<p>一片失望的喊声。其他两位教师发觉拦不住他，就把孩子们打发走，让他们沿着海边的悬崖朝沙丘走去。霍尔得意洋洋地一个箭步来到杜希先生身旁，但觉得自己的年龄大了，所以没拉住老师的手。他是胖胖的英俊少年，没有任何出众之处，在这一点上与他的父亲如出一辙。二十五年前，他父亲曾排在队伍里从校长面前走过去，消失到一家公学中，结了婚，成为一个男孩两个女孩的父亲，最近死于肺炎。霍尔生前是一位好市民，但工作懒散。郊游之前，杜希先生预先查明了这些情况。</p> 
<p>“喂，霍尔，你以为会听到一通说教吧，嗯？”</p> 
<p>“我不知道，老师。亚伯拉罕老师在说教之后给了我一本《神圣的田野》（译注：《神圣的田野》是萨缪尔.曼宁牧师写的一部宗教地理著作）。亚伯拉罕太太送给我一对袖口链扣。同学们给了我一套面值两元的危地马拉邮票。您看这张邮票，老师！柱子上还有一只鹦鹉呢。”</p> 
<p>“好极啦，好极啦！亚伯拉罕老师说了些什么？是不是说你是个可怜的罪人呢？”</p> 
<p>男孩大笑起来。他没听懂杜希先生的话，然而知道那是在开玩笑。他悠然自得，因为这是在本校的最后一天了。即便做错了，也不会被斥责。何况亚伯拉罕老师还说他成绩很好。他瞥过一眼校长写给他母亲的那封信的开头部分：“我们因他而自豪。他人萨宁顿之后，也会给本校添光彩。”同学们送给他许许多多礼物，声称他勇敢。然而大错特错——他不勇敢：他惧怕黑暗。但是没人知道这些。</p> 
<p>“喏，亚伯拉罕老师说什么来着？”当他们走到沙滩上之后，杜希先生重复了一遍。这预示着将有一番冗长的谈话，男孩希望自己跟同学们一起在悬崖上步行。然而他知道，当一个孩子遇上一个成人的时候，孩子的愿望是无济于事的。</p> 
<p>“亚伯拉罕老师教我效仿我父亲，老师。”</p> 
<p>“还说了什么？”</p> 
<p>“我决不能做任何羞于让我母亲知道的事。这样的话，任何人都不会误入歧途。他还说公学跟本校迥然不同。”</p> 
<p>“亚伯拉罕老师说过怎样不同了吗？”</p> 
<p>“困难重重——更像是两个世界。”</p> 
<p>“他告诉你这个世界的情况了吗？”</p> 
<p>“没有。”</p> 
<p>“你问他了吗？”</p> 
<p>“没有，老师。”</p> 
<p>“这你就不够明智了，霍尔。你应该把事情弄清楚。亚伯拉罕老师和我就是待在这儿替你们解答问题的。你认为这个世界——也就是成人的世界是什么样的呢？”</p> 
<p>“我说不上来，我不过是个孩子。”他非常真诚地说，“他们极其奸诈吗？老师？”</p> 
<p>杜希先生觉得有趣，让他举例说明自己所看到的奸诈行为。他回答说，成年人不欺负孩子，然而他们相互间不总是在尔虞我诈吗？他抛弃了学生应有的规矩，说起话来像孩子一般，变得充满幻想，很有意思。杜希先生躺在沙滩上倾听，他点燃烟斗，仰望天空。如今他们已把寄宿学校所在的矿泉地甩在后面了，一群师生则在遥远的前方。天色灰暗，没有风，云彩与太阳混沌一片。</p> 
<p>“你跟你母亲住在一起吗？”杜希先生看出男孩有了自信，就打断他的话问道。</p> 
<p>“是的，老师。”</p> 
<p>“你有哥哥吗？”</p> 
<p>“没有，老师——只有艾达和吉蒂。”</p> 
<p>“伯伯叔叔呢？”</p> 
<p>“没有。”</p> 
<p>“那么，你不大认识成年的男人吧？”</p> 
<p>“母亲雇用一个马车夫，还有一个名叫乔治的园丁。然而您指的当然是绅士喽。母亲还雇了三个做家务的女佣，可她们懒得很，连艾达的袜子都不肯补。艾达是我的大妹妹。”</p> 
<p>“你多大啦？”</p> 
<p>“十四岁九个月。”</p> 
<p>“喏，你是个不开窍的小家伙。”他们二人笑了。他歇了口气，又说下去，“我在你这个年龄的时候，我父亲告诉了我一件事．极其有用，受益匪浅。”这不是真的，他父亲从来没有告诉过他任何事。但是在进入正题之前，他需要一段开场白。</p> 
<p>“是吗，老师？”</p> 
<p>“我跟你说说他都告诉了我些什么事，好吗？”</p> 
<p>“好的，老师。”</p> 
<p>“我就只当做了你的父亲，跟你聊几分钟，莫瑞斯！我现在用你的教名称呼你。”于是，他非常直率诚恳地探讨起性的神秘来。他谈到原始时代神创造了男性与女性，以便让大地上充满了人，还谈到了男女能发挥本能的时期。“莫瑞斯，你快要成人了，所以我才告诉你这些事。你母亲不能跟你谈这个，你也不应该对她或任何一个女子提起这个话题。倘若在你即将要去的那座学校里，同学们跟你提到这事，就堵住他们的嘴，告诉他们你已经知道了。你原来听说过吗？”</p> 
<p>“没有，老师。”</p> 
<p>“一句也没听说过？”</p> 
<p>“没有，老师。”</p> 
<p>杜希先生站了起来，继续抽着烟斗，他看中了一片平坦的沙地，并在上面用手杖画了示意图。“这样一来就容易理解了。”男孩呆呆地看着，好像与他的人生风马牛不相及。他专心致志地倾听，很自然，老师在给他一个人授课。他知道话题是严肃的，涉及自己的肉体。但是他无法把它与自己联系起来，这就犹如一道难以解答的问题，杜希先生的说明自右耳朵进去，从左耳朵出来，简直是白费力气。他头脑迟钝，反应不过来。虽然进入了青春期，却茫然无知，性的冲动在恍惚状态下正悄悄地潜入他的身体内部。打破这种恍惚状态是无济于事的，不论怎样科学地、善意地加以描述也没有用。少年被唤醒后会重新昏睡起来，那个时期到来之前，是无法将他引诱进去的。</p> 
<p>不论杜希先生的科学知识怎样，侧隐之心是有的。说实在的，他太温情了，认为莫瑞斯具备有教养的人的理智，却不曾领悟孩子要么对此一窍不通，要么会弄得不知所措。“这一切挺麻烦的，”他说，“可是得了解它，而不该把它看得很神秘。伟大的事情——爱、人生——将接踵而至。”他口若悬河。以往他也曾跟孩子们像这样谈过，而且知道他们会提出些什么问题。莫瑞斯却不发问，只是说：“我明白，我明白，我明白。”起初杜希先生怕他不明白，就问了一番，他的回答令人满意。男孩的记性很好。人的思维真是妙不可言，他甚至进一步阐述了似是而非的领悟，对成年人那诱导的光亮做出反应，闪烁出徒有其表的光辉。最后他确实提出了一两个关于性的问题，都很中肯，杜希先生十分满意。“就是那样。”他说，“这回你就永远不会迷惑不解或感到烦恼了。”</p> 
<p>然而，还有爱与人生的问题。当他们沿着暗灰色的海边漫步的时候，他谈到这些。他谈到由于禁欲的缘故变得纯洁的理想人物，他描绘了女性的光辉。目前已订了婚的他，越谈越富于人情味儿，透过深度眼镜，目光炯炯有神。他的两颊泛红了。爱一个高尚的女子，保护并侍奉她——他告诉这个稚气的男孩，人生的意义就在于此。“眼下你还不能理解这些，有一天你会理解的。当你理解了的时候，可要记起那个启蒙你的老教师。所有的事都安排得严丝合缝——神在天上，尘世太平无事。男人和女人！多么美妙啊！”</p> 
<p>“我认为我是不会结婚的。”莫瑞斯说。</p> 
<p>“十年后的今天——我邀请你和你太太跟我和夫人一起吃饭。你肯光临吗？”</p> 
<p>“哦，老师！”他笑逐颜开。</p> 
<p>“那么，一言为定！”不管怎样，用这句笑话来结束今天的谈话．可谓恰如其分。莫瑞斯受宠若惊，开始深思婚姻问题。然而，’l1他们溜达了一段后，杜希先生停下脚步，好像所有的牙齿都疼痛起来一般，双手捧着两颊。他转过身去，望着来路那长长的一片沙地。</p> 
<p>“我忘记抹掉那些该死的示意图啦。”他慢吞吞地说。</p> 
<p>海湾那边有几个人，正沿着海岸朝着他们走来。其中还有个女人，他们的路线刚好经过杜希先生所画的性器官图解。他吓出一身冷汗，拔腿就往回奔。</p> 
<p>“老师，不要紧吧？”莫瑞斯大声喊道。“现在潮水早把它们淹没了。”</p> 
<p>“天哪……谢天谢地……涨潮啦。”</p> 
<p>刹那间，男孩猛地鄙视起他来。“撒谎大王！”他想。“撒谎大王，胆小鬼，他所说的都是无稽之谈。”……接着，黑暗将少年笼罩住。久远的然而并非是永恒的黑暗落下帷幕，等待着自身那充满痛苦的黎明。</p>
