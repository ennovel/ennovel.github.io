What could it mean?
<br> 
<br> “Come down out of there!” cried Mr. Martin. “Come down out of my haymow, and tell me what you mean! What are you after, anyhow?”
<br> 
<br> “We want to catch that crooked-nosed man,” answered Jerry. “We didn’t tell you before, but we think he is a thief.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, I come pretty near knowing you are!” was the grim retort. “Come down here!”
<br> 
<br> There was no choice but to obey, and rather puzzled as to what it all meant, and why Pug Kennedy should come to make such an accusation, the three chums slid to the barn floor from the haymow. They might miss their chance of catching the crooked-nosed man, but it could not be helped.
<br> 
<br> “There! What’d I tell you?” exclaimed Pug, pointing to Ned, as the chums faced the now angry farmer. “If those aren’t egg stains I’ll never eat another bit of chow!”
<br> 
<br> [184]
<br> 
<br> Too late Ned realized what his accidental slipping into the hen’s nest meant. The evidence was damaging against him. The whites and yolks of the eggs dripped from his hands, and there were stains on his uniform.
<br> 
<br> “Ha! Caught you, didn’t I?” exclaimed the farmer. “Now you’ll pay for this!”
<br> 
<br> “We’re perfectly willing to pay for the damage we accidentally did to your eggs,” answered Ned. “I believe I broke half a dozen, possibly more. But it was while I was crawling around, trying to get the crooked-nosed man, who was escaping.”
<br> 
<br> “It’s a good story, but it won’t wash,” laughed Pug Kennedy. “They were after your eggs, farmer, and that’s the truth.”
<br> 
<br> “I believe you, and I’m much obliged to you for telling me. It isn’t the first time I’ve been robbed by soldiers out on a hike, and I said the next time it happened I’d complain. I’m going to. You’ll come with me before your officers, and see what happens.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, that’s all nonsense!” exclaimed Jerry. “We admit we broke some of your eggs by accident, and we’re willing to pay, and pay well for them. We didn’t intend to steal!”
<br> 
<br> “I should say not!” chimed in Ned, wiping his hands off on some hay.
<br> 
<br> “I don’t know what you might do,” was the answer. “I only know what I see—egg stains.[185] You might have sneaked into the barn if I hadn’t seen you. And when I did notice you, you told me some story about a crooked-nosed man to make it sound natural.”
<br> 
<br> “But there is a crooked-nosed man,” insisted Bob.
<br> 
<br> “Course there is,” said the farmer. “I admit that. But he isn’t such an unusual man. For all I know you may have seen him driving in with my wagon—he’d been to town—and you made up that story about wanting to see him.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, we did see him driving,” admitted Bob. “And then we thought——”
<br> 
<br> He stopped. He realized that appearances were against him and his chums, and that any explanation they might make, especially after Ned’s mishap with the eggs, would seem strange.
<br> 
<br> “First I thought you were all right, and really did want to see my hired man,” went on the farmer. “But when this other soldier came and said he’d seen you go into my barn, and had heard you talking about getting eggs for a good feed, why, I realized what you were up to.”
<br> 
<br> “Did he tell you that yarn about us?” asked Jerry, looking at Pug.
<br> 
<br> “He did. And it’s the truth.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, it isn’t the truth, and he knows it!” cried Ned. “He’s taking this means of getting even because of what he thinks we did to him. All right![186] Let it go at that. We’ll go before the officers with you. We’re not afraid! We’ll tell the truth.”
<br> 
<br> “You’d better!” declared Mr. Martin. “You wait till I hitch up and I’ll take you back to camp. This soldierin’ business is all right, and I’m in full sympathy with it. But it isn’t right to rob farmers, and your officers won’t stand for it.”
<br> 
<br> “We didn’t intend to rob you,” said Jerry. “And while you are acting this way that man, who may be a desperate criminal, is escaping. If you are bound to take us before our officers, at least look after the crooked-nosed chap.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, I can lay hands on him when I want him,” said the farmer, and then Ned, Bob and Jerry realized how futile it was to argue with him.
<br> 
<br> “It’s too bad!” murmured Bob, as they drove back to the camp in the wagon, Pug declining to accompany them, saying he would walk.
<br> 
<br> “Yes, it is tough,” agreed Jerry. “Just when we were about to get hold of Crooked Nose! If he’s the one you think he is, Bob, he’ll take the alarm and skip.”
<br> 
<br> “That’s what I’m afraid of. Hang Pug, anyhow! What’s his game?”
<br> 
<br> “Maybe he made the accusation against us to cover up some trick of his own,” suggested Ned, in a low voice so the now unfriendly farmer would not hear. “Pug had some object in coming[187] away from camp, and it wasn’t to follow us, for he didn’t know what we were going to do.”
<br> 
<br> “I don’t believe he did,” assented Jerry. “But he must have followed us, and when he saw us go into the barn he made up his mean mind to make trouble for us.”
<br> 
<br> This was the only explanation the boys could think of, and they had to let it go at that.
<br> 
<br> The three chums had to stand no little chaffing and gibing when they were brought back to camp in practical custody of the farmer. It was not uncommon for the lads, on hikes and practice marches, to raid orchards and hen roosts, and punishment was always meted out to the offenders, while payment for the damage done was taken from their pay, and their comrades jumped to this as the explanation of the present predicament of Ned, Bob and Jerry.
<br> 
<br> “But this accusation is unjust!” said Ned, when they were taken before their captain. “It’s all a mistake.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, let’s hear about it,” said the officer somewhat wearily, for there had been several cases of raids on this march.
<br> 
<br> Thereupon Mr. Martin told his story of having been informed by Kennedy of the alleged intentions of the motor boys. And he told of having seen them slide down from his haymow, one[188] of them bearing unmistakable evidence of eggs on his person.
<br> 
<br> “I know it looks queer,” said Ned.
<br> 
<br> “It certainly does,” agreed the captain, grimly.
<br> 
<br> But he was a just man and he listened to the boys’ story. He seemed somewhat surprised at the mention of the crooked-nosed man, but he made no comment, and when all was said he gave his judgment.
<br> 
<br> It was to the effect that as the boys had affirmed on their honor as soldiers and gentlemen that they were telling the truth, he could not but believe them. At the same time it was evident that they had done some slight damage, and had put the farmer to some inconvenience in bringing them back to camp, and it was only fair that they should pay. Having already offered to make payment, they were very willing to do this.
<br> 
<br> So the incident was ended, and the farmer, convinced that he was in the right, and jingling in his pocket a good price for the broken eggs, went back to his home.
<br> 
<br> So, much to their regret, the boys lost trace of Crooked Nose, or Jim Waydell, as the farmer had called him. They could not look for the suspect again that night, and the next morning they had to march away with their comrades.
<br> 
<br> “But when we get back to camp we’ll take a day or so off on furlough and come back here and see[189] if we can land him,” declared Bob. “We’re not sure enough of his identity, on such casual glances, to cause his arrest on mere information. We’ve got to get him ourselves and find out more about him.”
<br> 
<br> “We’re with you!” said Jerry, heartily.
<br> 
<br> The practice march was a success from a military standpoint, though it showed up some weak spots in the organization. But that was one of the objects.
<br> 
<br> For several days after the return of the army there were light drills to enable the boys to recover from the strenuous exercise. Then one evening Bob, in a state of some excitement, came hurrying into the Y. M. C. A. quarters, looking for Ned and Jerry.
<br> 
<br> “What’s up now?” they asked. “Have you seen Crooked Nose again?”
<br> 
<br> “No, but our company’s going to give a minstrel show, and the committee has asked me if we three will take part in it.”
<br> 
<br> “A minstrel show?” repeated Jerry.
<br> 
<br> “Yes, black up and everything!” exclaimed Bob. “It’ll be fun! Let’s do it!”
