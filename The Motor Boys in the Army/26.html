Post Number Ten!”
<br> 
<br> This was the cry, in various intonations, that went ringing down the line in the darkness. As instructed, Ned, Bob and Jerry, being the nearest to the place of the alarm, went to render what aid might be necessary to the sentry who had first called. Meanwhile the corporal of the guard, rousing those whose duty it was to go out with him and see to the disturbance, was hastening to the scene.
<br> 
<br> As Ned, Bob and Jerry approached they heard some one saying:
<br> 
<br> “But I must have it! I tell you I must get it. It is exceedingly valuable, and you ought not to stop me.”
<br> 
<br> “Stop you! I’ve stopped you all right!” came the vigorous tones of Kelly, the sentry.
<br> 
<br> “But I must get through. I must!”
<br> 
<br> “And I say you must not! Trying to run the guard under my very nose; that’s what you were[208] trying to do. But I caught you! You’re a German spy—that’s what you are!”
<br> 
<br> “No, I assure you that you are mistaken,” came a gentle voice in answer. “I am only after some new specimens——”
<br> 
<br> Ned, Bob and Jerry gave a shout.
<br> 
<br> “It’s him, all right!” cried Jerry, enthusiastically if not grammatically.
<br> 
<br> “I thought it sounded like him,” added Ned.
<br> 
<br> “Hello, Professor Snodgrass!” called Bob. “It’s all right. Keep quiet. We’ll be with you in a minute!”
<br> 
<br> They raced up to the excited sentry, who stood holding a small, bald-headed man, at the same time flashing in his face a pocket electric lamp.
<br> 
<br> “Oh, it’s you, boys, is it?” asked the little man, who did not seem at all disturbed by the situation in which he found himself. “Well, I’m glad to see you. I just arrived, getting in rather late on account of a delayed train. I walked over, intending to visit you. I had no idea it was so late, but I am glad it is, for I have just seen some specimens of moth that only fly about this hour. I wanted to catch some but—er—this gentleman——”
<br> 
<br> Professor Snodgrass, for it was he, paused and looked at his captor.
<br> 
<br> “You’re right! I wouldn’t let you go chasin’[209] through the lines!” exclaimed Kelly. “Do you know him?” he asked the motor boys.
<br> 
<br> “He is a friend of ours,” declared Jerry. “We know him well. He is Professor Uriah Snodgrass, of Boxwood Hall, and what he says is true—he does collect moths and other bugs.”
<br> 
<br> “Sufferin’ cats!” cried Kelly. “And I took him for a German spy! I beg your pardon,” he went on. “My father was a professor in Dublin University, and I’m sorry I disturbed you. I’ll help you collect bugs when I’m off duty.”
<br> 
<br> “Thank you!” said Professor Snodgrass, as if it was the most natural thing in the world to get offers of assistance in this way. “I shall be glad of help. Ha! There is one of the late-flying moths now!” and he reached over and made a grab for something on the shoulder of the corporal of the guard, who had come running up.
<br> 
<br> “Here! None of that! What’s the idea! Disarm him!” cried the corporal, who was hardly awake yet. “Has he bombs on him?” he asked of Kelly.
<br> 
<br> “I guess it’s all a mistake,” the sentry replied. “I was patrolling my post, when I saw some one walking along, and seemingly picking things up off the ground. Or maybe, I thought, he was planting infernal machines. So I rushed over and grabbed him, and I yelled and——”
<br> 
<br> “I was only gathering bugs by the light of my[210] little electric lamp,” the professor explained. “I had no idea I was so near the army camp, though I intended to visit it to see my friends,” and he motioned to the motor boys. With his usual absent-mindedness he had forgotten all about everything but what he saw immediately before him—the bugs and the night moths.
<br> 
<br> “Do you know this gentleman?” asked the corporal of Jerry.
<br> 
<br> “Yes, he is a very good friend of ours.”
<br> 
<br> “Then you may release him,” went on the corporal to Kelly. “And we are sorry for what happened.”
<br> 
<br> But it is doubtful if Professor Snodgrass heard him, for the little scientist was again reaching forward to get something from the shoulder of the corporal. This time he succeeded, and those gathered about had a glimpse of a white, fluttering object.
<br> 
<br> “One of the finest and largest white moths I have ever caught!” exclaimed the delighted professor. “I thank you!” he added, as though the corporal had done him a great favor by serving as a perch for the insect.
<br> 
<br> The excitement caused by the capture of the “prisoner” soon passed, and the corporal went back to his rest, while Ned, Bob and Jerry, whose tour of duty was up, took Professor Snodgrass in charge.
<br> 
<br> [211]
<br> 
<br> They explained the matter to the officer in charge of their barracks, and a spare bunk was found for the college instructor.
<br> 
<br> But he did not seem inclined to use it. He wanted to sit up and enter in his note book something about the specimens he had caught in such a sensational manner, but when it was explained to him that to have lights in an army camp after ten o’clock was against the regulations, except in cases of emergency, he put out his pocket electric lantern and dutifully went to sleep, with his specimen boxes under his bed.
<br> 
<br> The next day Professor Snodgrass told the boys that so many students had enlisted from Boxwood Hall that the teaching force was greatly reduced.
<br> 
<br> “I was given a leave of absence,” he added, “and I decided to come to see you, and, at the same time, make a study of Southern moths and other insects. So I came on, getting in rather late, as I mentioned.”
<br> 
<br> “We’re mighty glad to see you,” returned Jerry.
<br> 
<br> “How are things in Cresville?” asked Ned. “Or didn’t you stop there?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, I did, as I wanted to get your exact addresses. Matters are quiet. A number of the boys have enlisted, or been drafted, as you know, but otherwise things are about the same, your folks say.”
<br> 
<br> “Any more news about the fire?” asked Bob.
<br> 
<br> [212]
<br> 
<br> “Well, the ruins are still there, and I believe that Frenchman—whose name I don’t recall—is in much distress about the loss of his money.”
<br> 
<br> “And Crooked Nose has been here!” burst out Bob. “We must try to nab him!”
<br> 
<br> He and his chums talked about the possibility of this, but it is doubtful if Professor Snodgrass heard, for, just then, a peculiar bug attracted his attention, and he began to “stalk” it, as Ned remarked.
<br> 
<br> The boys enjoyed the visit of the little scientist, and he took an interest in matters about Camp Dixton; that is, when he was not collecting bugs, in which occupation he spent most of his time.
<br> 
<br> It was on the night of Professor Snodgrass’ third day’s stay at the place where the soldier city had sprung up. Some hours after Ned, Bob and Jerry had gone to their bunks at the signal of taps, they were awakened by an alarm.
<br> 
<br> “I’ve got him! I’ve got him!” some one shouted.
