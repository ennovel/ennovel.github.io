GRANT ORDERS A NEW SUIT.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      Grant listened to what Rodney said, but Mr. Tarbox’s anger did not signify as much to him as it would have done a few hours earlier. The money he possessed made him feel independent.
<br> 
<br> Seth Tarbox appeared at the door, ready to empty the vials of his wrath on Grant’s devoted head.
<br> 
<br> “So you’ve been loiterin’ on the way, have you?” he said harshly. “You’ve been twice as long as you need to be.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, perhaps I have,” Grant admitted coolly.
<br> 
<br> “So you own up to it, do you?”
<br> 
<br> “Of course I do.”
<br> 
<br> “And what excuse have you?”
<br> 
<br> “Do you expect me to work all the time?”
<br> 
<br> “I expect you to earn your board and clothes.”
<br> 
<br> 39“I earn them both, and more too, but I don’t get the clothes.”
<br> 
<br> “Hey? Oh, I see. You loitered because I wouldn’t buy you a suit of clothes,” snarled Seth.
<br> 
<br> “You can take it that way if you want to,” said Grant.
<br> 
<br> “What’s got into you, Grant Colburn? ’Pears to me you are mighty independent all at once.”
<br> 
<br> “That’s the way I feel.”
<br> 
<br> “You seem to forget that but for me you wouldn’t have a home.”
<br> 
<br> “When you get tired of providing me with a home, Mr. Tarbox, I will find one somewhere else.”
<br> 
<br> “So you think, but if you leave my home you’ll become a poor tramp.”
<br> 
<br> Rodney laughed.
<br> 
<br> “I guess you’re right, grandfather,” he said.
<br> 
<br> Grant darted a look at him which showed that he understood the nature of his feelings.
<br> 
<br> “Well,” he said, “I’ll take the risk.”
<br> 
<br> “I don’t take back the offer of a suit of 40clothes, Grant,” said Rodney smoothly. “I’ll bring ’em over the next time I come.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, do, Rodney,” put in his grandfather.
<br> 
<br> “You needn’t take the trouble, Rodney,” said Grant. “I shan’t wear the suit if you bring it.”
<br> 
<br> “I suppose you expect I’ll buy you a new one,” sneered Seth Tarbox.
<br> 
<br> “No, I don’t.”
<br> 
<br> “Then you are content to go as you are?”
<br> 
<br> “No, I shall have a new suit in a few days, if I have to pay for it myself.”
<br> 
<br> “You’re welcome to do that,” responded Seth in a tone of satisfaction, for he concluded that Grant’s mother would pay the bill, and that suited him.
<br> 
<br> No more was said to Grant on the subject of his delay in returning from the other farm. He had occasion a little later to go on an errand, and called at the village tailor’s.
<br> 
<br> “Mr. Shick,” he said, “I want you to make me up a good serviceable suit. How much will it cost?”
<br> 
<br> “It depends on the cloth, Grant. Here is a remnant that will wear like iron. I can make 41it up in two styles, according to the trimmings, seventeen dollars or twenty.”
<br> 
<br> “I want a good suit, and will pay twenty.”
<br> 
<br> The tailor was rather surprised, for he knew that Grant’s step-father was a thoroughly mean man.
<br> 
<br> “Mr. Tarbox is getting liberal, isn’t he?” he inquired. “That’s more than he pays for his own suits.”
<br> 
<br> “He isn’t going to pay for mine.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, it’s your mother, then.”
<br> 
<br> “No, I shall pay for it myself.”
<br> 
<br> “Will it be cash down?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes.”
<br> 
<br> “I am glad you are so well off, Grant,” said Mr. Shick, puzzled.
<br> 
<br> “So am I. You may rest assured that you won’t have to wait for your money.”
<br> 
<br> “Then I’ll do a good job. You shall have as nice a suit as any boy in the village. You deserve it, too, Grant, for you’re a hard-working boy.”
<br> 
<br> “Just say that to Mr. Tarbox when you meet him,” said Grant, smiling, “for I am afraid he doesn’t fully appreciate me.”
<br> 
<br> 42As Grant left the tailor’s shop he met Rodney at the door. Rodney found the farm rather a slow place, and had made a second visit to the village.
<br> 
<br> “Hallo,” he exclaimed, “have you been into the tailor’s?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes,”
<br> 
<br> “I suppose you had business there.”
<br> 
<br> “I had.”
<br> 
<br> “What was it?”
<br> 
<br> “You can ask Mr. Shick, if you like. I’m in a hurry.”
<br> 
<br> Rodney decided to act on this suggestion.
<br> 
<br> “How do you do, Mr. Shick?” he said politely, for he wanted to get some information. “I see Grant has just been in here.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes.”
<br> 
<br> “Are you going to make him a suit?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes.”
<br> 
<br> Rodney was surprised.
<br> 
<br> “Would you mind showing me the cloth?” he asked. “I might like to get a suit myself.”
<br> 
<br> “I shall be happy to fill your order. This is the cloth.”
<br> 
<br> “It looks pretty good.”
<br> 
<br> 43“Yes, it is of excellent quality.”
<br> 
<br> “How much do you charge for a suit off this cloth?”
<br> 
<br> “Twenty dollars is what I charged Grant.”
<br> 
<br> It must be explained that Shick, being in the country, was obliged to put his prices a good deal lower for the same article than if he lived in the city.
<br> 
<br> “Well, I hope you’ll get your pay,” said Rodney shortly.
<br> 
<br> “I shan’t trouble myself about that. Grant is an honest boy.”
<br> 
<br> “Well, I’m glad you feel so confident.”
<br> 
<br> Rodney left the shop abruptly, and, going into the street, came face to face with his grandfather.
<br> 
<br> “Grandfather,” he said, “I’ve got some news for you.”
<br> 
<br> “Have you, Rodney? What is it?”
<br> 
<br> “Grant has ordered a suit of Mr. Shick, for which the price is twenty dollars.”
<br> 
<br> “You don’t mean it?” ejaculated the farmer.
<br> 
<br> “Yes, I do. I suppose the bill will be sent to you,” added Rodney, desirous of making trouble.
<br> 
<br> 44“I won’t pay it!” exclaimed Seth Tarbox excitedly.
<br> 
<br> “You’d better see Mr. Shick about it.”
<br> 
<br> Seth Tarbox entered the shop, looking flurried.
<br> 
<br> “Is it true, Mr. Shick,” he said abruptly, “that Grant has ordered a twenty-dollar suit of you?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, Mr. Tarbox.”
<br> 
<br> “If you expect me to pay for it, you’ll be disappointed. Did Grant tell you to charge it to me?”
<br> 
<br> “No; he said he would pay for it himself.”
<br> 
<br> “I suppose he expects to get the money out of his mother,” continued Mr. Tarbox, feeling somewhat relieved. “It will be a shame to make her pay so much. Why, I don’t pay that for my own suits.”
<br> 
<br> “Why don’t you?” asked the tailor bluntly. “You can afford it.”
<br> 
<br> “I don’t believe in throwing away money,” answered Seth shortly.
<br> 
<br> “You wouldn’t. This suit of Grant’s will wear like iron.”
<br> 
<br> “It’s all foolish extravagance. Rodney, my 45grandson, offered to give him one of his old cast-off suits.”
<br> 
<br> Mr. Shick smiled.
<br> 
<br> “Probably Grant thought he would prefer a new one.”
<br> 
<br> “But it’s wasteful extravagance.”
<br> 
<br> “Mr. Tarbox, you need a new suit yourself. You’d better let me make you one. You don’t want your step-son to outshine you.”
<br> 
<br> “I’ll see about it. I can make the old one do a little longer.”
<br> 
<br> When Mr. Tarbox got home he at once tackled his wife.
<br> 
<br> “Mrs. T.,” he said, “I’m surprised at your letting Grant order a twenty-dollar suit. Truly a fool and his money are soon parted, as the saying is.”
<br> 
<br> “I don’t know what you mean, Mr. Tarbox, and I’ll thank you not to call me a fool,” she added, with a flash of spirit.
<br> 
<br> “You mean to say you haven’t authorized Grant to order a twenty-dollar suit at Mr. Shick’s?”
<br> 
<br> “Grant hasn’t asked me to buy him a suit?”
<br> 
<br> 46“Well, he’s ordered one, for Mr. Shick told me so. It aint possible that he’s going to trust that boy. I don’t understand it.”
<br> 
<br> “Nor do I. I will speak to Grant about it.”
<br> 
<br> Mrs. Tarbox felt anxious, for the story seemed strange and almost incredible. It did not seem like Grant, but still she knew that he was very anxious to have a new suit. She would have been willing to advance ten dollars to buy him a ready-made one, but twenty dollars in her circumstances would be extravagant.
<br> 
<br> Just then Grant entered the room.
<br> 
<br> “Grant,” she said, “have you ordered a suit at Mr. Shick’s?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, mother.”
<br> 
<br> “At twenty dollars?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, mother.”
<br> 
<br> “How could you be so inconsiderate? Mr. Tarbox will not pay for it, and I cannot afford to pay so high a price.”
<br> 
<br> “Don’t be worried, mother,” said Grant quietly, “I shall pay for it myself.”
