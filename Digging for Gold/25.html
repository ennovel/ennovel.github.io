ANOTHER LONELY CABIN.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      They reached the cabin at last, and then a question which Grant was about to ask was answered. The old man lived alone.
<br> 
<br> The furniture was of the simplest: a bed, a couple of chairs, a table, and a few dishes.
<br> 
<br> “Is there no one to take care of you?” asked Grant.
<br> 
<br> “No, I need no one,” was the quick reply. “I have remedies that will soon quiet the pain.”
<br> 
<br> “I should think you would feel lonely.”
<br> 
<br> “I prefer solitude to the society of mean, selfish, and designing men,” answered the old man bitterly.
<br> 
<br> “All men are not mean or selfish.”
<br> 
<br> “No doubt you are right, but those whom I trusted most have proved so.”
<br> 
<br> “How long have you lived here?”
<br> 
<br> 212“Six years.”
<br> 
<br> “Are you—poor? If so, perhaps I can help you.”
<br> 
<br> “No, no; poverty is the smallest of my troubles. Look there!” and the old man drew from his pocket a handful of gold pieces. “I have enough to see me through the few years I have yet to live.”
<br> 
<br> “But you have no occupation—no way to fill up your time?”
<br> 
<br> “I have a few books and my own thoughts. I will tell you what little is to be told. I came here six years ago, and for a time devoted myself to gold-digging. I was fortunate, and secured all I needed for my modest wants. Then I stopped, for I had no object in accumulating more. But you tell me about yourself. You are young to be in California.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, I came to seek my fortune. I was a poor boy, and my mother is unhappily situated. I came to see if I could not improve her lot and my own.”
<br> 
<br> “What are you doing?”
<br> 
<br> “I am digging for gold.”
<br> 
<br> “Where?”
<br> 
<br> 213“At Howe’s Gulch.”
<br> 
<br> “Have you succeeded?”
<br> 
<br> “So poorly that I am thinking of giving it up and going elsewhere. In Sacramento I worked in a restaurant, and made a good deal more money than I have made at the mines. I am twenty dollars poorer than when I came here.”
<br> 
<br> “Are you alone?”
<br> 
<br> “No, I have a friend with me—a young man whose acquaintance I made in crossing the plains.”
<br> 
<br> “Is he a true friend—a loyal friend?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes.”
<br> 
<br> “Then there are such in the world. Those I have met have been of a different kind. Has he been any more fortunate than yourself?”
<br> 
<br> “Not since I arrived. He did something before I came, but I must have brought him bad luck, for he has been running behind ever since. We have not been making expenses for the last month.”
<br> 
<br> “I never thought much of Howe’s Gulch, though some have been fortunate there.”
<br> 
<br> 214“Then it was not there that you found your gold?”
<br> 
<br> “No.”
<br> 
<br> Grant wanted to ask the old man where it was that his claim was located, but hesitated, not knowing how the question would be received.
<br> 
<br> “I can direct you to a rich spot,” said the old man, after a pause. “I had intended to let the secret die with me, but you have done me a service——”
<br> 
<br> “A very slight one,” said Grant modestly.
<br> 
<br> “Not slight, for without your help I should have been unable to get home.”
<br> 
<br> “I was glad to serve you, and do not need compensation. You may wish to work the claim yourself.”
<br> 
<br> “No; my days of labor are over. I am sixty-five, and might easily be taken for ten years older. I shall be glad to contribute to your happiness and success, and that of your friend.”
<br> 
<br> “Perhaps some one may have discovered and worked the claim.”
<br> 
<br> “No; it is an out-of-the-way place, and has not attracted attention.”
<br> 
<br> 215“How, then, did you discover it?”
<br> 
<br> “By accident. As to the richness, let this convince you: in less than six months I took out ten thousand dollars, and having no need of more, stopped working, and carefully removed all traces likely to betray the mine’s entrance to a casual observer.”
<br> 
<br> “It will be a great favor to Tom and myself. We ought to give you a share of the proceeds.”
<br> 
<br> The old man shook his head.
<br> 
<br> “I shall not live long enough to spend the money I have,” he answered. “You are welcome to all it will yield you. Come here with your friend to-morrow morning, and I will give you the directions that will enable you to find the claim.”
<br> 
<br> “Can I do anything more for you before I go?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes; you may go to the stream behind the cabin and bring me some fresh water.”
<br> 
<br> Grant did as requested, and, elated by his unexpected good luck, started on his return to Howe’s Gulch.
<br> 
<br> When Grant reached the cabin jointly occupied 216by himself and Tom Cooper, he found Tom sitting outside, smoking his pipe.
<br> 
<br> He looked very thoughtful.
<br> 
<br> “Have you got rid of your headache, Grant?” he asked.
<br> 
<br> “Yes; I feel as lively as a cricket.”
<br> 
<br> “Then your walk has done you good?”
<br> 
<br> “A great deal of good,” answered Grant; but Tom did not detect the significance hidden in the reply. “How long have you been at home?”
<br> 
<br> “An hour.”
<br> 
<br> “Then you knocked off work earlier than usual.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes,” answered Tom soberly. “To tell the truth, Grant, I’m discouraged. How much do you think our day’s work amounts to?”
<br> 
<br> “Yours and mine?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes.”
<br> 
<br> “How much?”
<br> 
<br> “A dollar and seventy-five cents! I think, Grant, we had better inquire the location of the nearest poor house. We may want to ask admission.”
<br> 
<br> 217“There’s an old saying, Tom: ‘The darkest hour is just before the day.’”
<br> 
<br> “How does that apply here?”
<br> 
<br> “I will tell you. I have secured a claim from which ten thousand dollars was obtained within six months.”
<br> 
<br> “And then it petered out?”
<br> 
<br> “No; the owner stopped working it because he had money enough, and was satisfied.”
<br> 
<br> “Hasn’t it been worked since?”
<br> 
<br> “No.”
<br> 
<br> “How much did you agree to pay for it?” asked Tom, in excitement.
<br> 
<br> “Nothing. It was given me for a service I rendered the owner.”
<br> 
<br> “This seems like a fairy tale, Grant. What does it mean?”
<br> 
<br> “I will tell you;” and Grant related his afternoon’s adventure.
<br> 
<br> “Hurrah! we’re in luck!” exclaimed Tom, rising to his feet and swinging his hat in excitement. “If what you say is true, we’re made men.”
<br> 
<br> “I am glad you look upon me as a man,” said Grant, smiling.
<br> 
<br> 218“I’m only anticipating a little. I hope,” he added anxiously, “the old man won’t reconsider the matter.”
<br> 
<br> “Not much chance of it. I haven’t known him long, but I am quite sure that he isn’t that kind of a man.”
