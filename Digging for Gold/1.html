GRANT AND HIS MOTHER.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      “Mother, this is an important day for me,” said Grant Colburn, as he entered the kitchen with an armful of wood, and deposited it in the box behind the stove.
<br> 
<br> His mother looked up from the table where she was cutting out pie crust, and asked in surprise, “What do you mean, Grant? Why is to-day any different from ordinary days?”
<br> 
<br> “I am sixteen to-day, mother!”
<br> 
<br> “So you are, Grant. I ought to have thought of it. I am sorry,” she added wistfully, “that I haven’t got a present for you, but you know Mr. Tarbox——”
<br> 
<br> “Is the stingiest man in the country. Yes, I know that well enough.”
<br> 
<br> 2“I actually haven’t a cent that I can call my own, Grant.”
<br> 
<br> “I know that very well, mother. It was an unlucky day when you married that old skinflint.”
<br> 
<br> “Don’t call him that, Grant,” said his mother, with an apprehensive look in the direction of the door.
<br> 
<br> “He’s all that, and more if possible. When did he give you any money last?”
<br> 
<br> “Two weeks ago.”
<br> 
<br> “And how much did he give you at that time?”
<br> 
<br> “Twenty-five cents.”
<br> 
<br> “What a shame! Why, if you had hired out as his housekeeper he would have been compelled to give you more.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, Grant,” sighed Mrs. Tarbox, “I wish I were his housekeeper instead of his wife. I should be more independent.”
<br> 
<br> “He made a good bargain when he married you, mother. But I never understood why you married him.”
<br> 
<br> “I acted for the best, as I thought, Grant. You know how your poor father left us. 3After his affairs were settled, there were only two hundred and fifty dollars left, and you were but twelve years old. I took in sewing, and earned what I could, but at the end of a year I had used up a hundred dollars of our small capital. Then Mr. Tarbox asked me to marry him, and I agreed, for I thought it would give us a comfortable home.”
<br> 
<br> “A comfortable home!” repeated Grant. “We have enough to eat, it is true, but you never worked so hard in your life, and I can say the same for myself. I was barely fourteen when Mr. Tarbox took me away from school, and since then I have had to work early and late. At five o’clock, winter and summer, I have to turn out of bed, and work all day, so that when night comes I am dead tired.”
<br> 
<br> “That is true, Grant,” said his mother, with a look of distress. “You work too hard for a boy of your age.”
<br> 
<br> “And what do I get for it?” continued Grant indignantly. “I haven’t any clothes. Charlie Titus asked me the other day why I didn’t go to church. I was ashamed to tell him 4that it was because I had no clothes fit to wear there. It is a year since I had my last suit, and now I have grown out of it. My coat is too short in the sleeves, and my pantaloons in the legs.”
<br> 
<br> “Perhaps I can lengthen them out, Grant.”
<br> 
<br> “You did it six months ago. There is no more chance. No, I’ll tell you what I am going to do. I’ll ask Mr. Tarbox for a new suit, and as it is my birthday, perhaps he will open his heart and be generous for once.”
<br> 
<br> “It is a good plan, Grant. There he is now, out by the well curb.”
<br> 
<br> “Then I’ll speak at once. Wish me luck, mother.”
<br> 
<br> “I do, my son. I heartily wish you good luck now and always.”
<br> 
<br> Grant opened the side door, and went out into the yard. Seth Tarbox looked up, and his glance fell upon his step-son.
<br> 
<br> “Come here, Grant,” he said, “I want you to turn the grindstone while I sharpen my scythe.”
<br> 
<br> “Wait a minute, Mr. Tarbox. I want to speak to you.”
<br> 
<br> 5“Go ahead! You can speak if you want to,” said Tarbox, slightly surprised.
<br> 
<br> “It is my birthday to-day.”
<br> 
<br> “Is it? How old be you?”
<br> 
<br> “Sixteen.”
<br> 
<br> “A boy of sixteen ought to do a great deal of work. Why, you are ’most a man.”
<br> 
<br> “I do a good deal of work, Mr. Tarbox, but I don’t seem to get much pay for it.”
<br> 
<br> “Hey? You want pay? Why, don’t you get your victuals and clothes?”
<br> 
<br> “I get my victuals, yes. But I don’t get clothes, and that is just what I want to speak to you about.”
<br> 
<br> Mr. Tarbox began to grow uneasy. He knew what was coming.
<br> 
<br> “What have you got on, I’d like to know?” he inquired.
<br> 
<br> “Some rags and overalls,” answered Grant bluntly.
<br> 
<br> “They’re good enough to work in. You’ve got a suit to wear Sundays.”
<br> 
<br> “Have I? It’s hardly fit to wear common days. Why, it’s a year since I had the suit, and I’ve outgrown it.”
<br> 
<br> 6“I’m afraid you’re getting proud, Grant,” said his step-father uneasily.
<br> 
<br> “I’m not proud of my clothes, I can tell you that. Mr. Tarbox, I’ve worked for you the last year early and late, and I think I ought to have a new suit. It will make a nice birthday present.”
<br> 
<br> “Money’s very skerce, Grant,” said his step-father uneasily, “and clothes are very high. I gave twelve dollars for that last suit of yours. It came hard. Think how long it takes to earn twelve dollars. I haven’t had a suit myself for ten months.”
<br> 
<br> “But you can have one if you want it.”
<br> 
<br> “I’ll tell you what I’ll do, Grant,” said Mr. Tarbox, with a bright idea. “You’re ’most as big as I am. You’re unusually large for your age. I’ll buy a new suit for myself, and give you mine. Your mother can fix it over to fit you.”
<br> 
<br> Grant’s face assumed a look of disgust.
<br> 
<br> “Thank you, Mr. Tarbox,” he said, “but I don’t want to wear your old clothes. If I can’t have a new suit I don’t want any.”
<br> 
<br> “’Pears to me you’re mighty particular.”
<br> 
<br> 7“I don’t think so. I only want what’s right. Most boys of my age have at least two new suits a year. Charlie Titus had three.”
<br> 
<br> “Then his father’s very foolish to gratify his love of finery. Come, we’d better go to work.”
<br> 
<br> “You haven’t answered my question yet, Mr. Tarbox.”
<br> 
<br> “What is it?” asked Tarbox peevishly.
<br> 
<br> “Will you buy me a new suit?”
<br> 
<br> “Wait two or three months, Grant.”
<br> 
<br> “Why should I wait two or three months? I need the clothes now.”
<br> 
<br> “Money may be easier then.”
<br> 
<br> “I am not willing to wait.”
<br> 
<br> “’Pears to me you’re very headstrong, Grant Colburn,” said the farmer in a tone of displeasure.
<br> 
<br> “I want my rights. I won’t work if you are going to deal so closely with me.”
<br> 
<br> Seth Tarbox frowned, and looked perplexed. But presently an idea came to him and his face smoothed.
<br> 
<br> “Perhaps we can fix it, Grant,” he said in a conciliatory tone.
<br> 
<br> 8Grant felt encouraged. It looked as if his request were to be granted.
<br> 
<br> “I shall be very much obliged to you,” he said.
<br> 
<br> “Wait a minute! You aint got my idea. Your mother has money.”
<br> 
<br> “What if she has?” asked Grant suspiciously.
<br> 
<br> “If she will lend you ten or twelve dollars to buy a suit I’ll make it up to her in, say three or four months.”
<br> 
<br> Grant’s face darkened. He knew very well that the money never would be repaid, and he penetrated the crafty design of his step-father.
<br> 
<br> “No, Mr. Tarbox,” he said. “My mother’s money must not be touched. There’s little enough of it, and I don’t want her to run the risk of losing it.”
<br> 
<br> “But she won’t lose it. Didn’t I say I would pay it back?”
<br> 
<br> “Why can’t you advance the money yourself?”
<br> 
<br> “Didn’t I tell you money was skerce?” said Seth Tarbox irritably.
<br> 
<br> “I know you’ve got money in two savings 9banks, besides some railroad bonds. Tom Wilson told me the other day that you had over five thousand dollars in money and bonds.”
<br> 
<br> “Tom Wilson don’t know anything about my affairs,” said Tarbox hastily. “I’ll think it over, Grant, and mebbe—I won’t promise—I’ll see what I can do for you. Now we’ll go to work. It’s a sin to be idle.”
