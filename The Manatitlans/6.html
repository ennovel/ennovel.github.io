He advised us to keep at a safe distance from the shore, and never attempt to hold friendly intercourse with the savages, or endeavor to conciliate them with presents, as it would expose us to their deadly treachery. “You must be constant in your guard or they will board you in the night, for they are as familiar with darkness and water as the land. If they come within reach of your guns kill and spare not, for fear, if you can inspire it, will be your only source of safety.” Our daily experience had thus far confirmed the prudence of his advice, and it was yet a question of extreme hazard if we should attempt to land. Each day afforded additional evidence that the tribes were banded together in a defensive alliance against the whites, with a politic foresight that made intertribal jealousies secondary to their exclusion. When partisan ferocity, so deadly in manifestation with the aboriginal races of America, could be made to coalesce for protection against the aggressive tendencies of a race in customs and habits inimical to their own, it seemed an act of desperation to attempt the farther prosecution of our Quixotic enterprise. This feeling had perceptibly gained strength while the ferocious characteristics of the old savage remained unsubdued, under the impression that our vitality was held with a lease as precarious as his own. The padre’s exhibition 46of fear had established him in the belief that in stoical courage we were inferior to his own race. This impression he had evidently found means to convey to his tribe. But Mr. Welson had, by a seemingly chance train of humorous experiment, dissipated his reliance upon the savage hypothesis of instinctive sagacity. The fancied superiority of his exaltation realized to the old chief the attributes of deity, while the padre became reduced, in his estimation, to a kindred caste with his tribe. In train the gyved circlet of his neck, as a talismanic badge of investment, would be likely to afford material evidence in proof of Mr. Welson’s deistical power. These impressions, which it would be natural for him to impart, would prove ominous as a prestige of awe, similar in effect to that afforded by Moses to the Israelites. The contrast between the old chief and Waantha discovered a marked distinction in tribal caste, dependent upon the miasmatic influence exerted by local impressions derived from degrees of purity in the sources of exhalation that gave birth to kindred habits and customs. The former devoted his attention to engendered animosity, while the latter eagerly searched for some token of kindly sympathy, and when it was bestowed his whole being became instinct with grateful pleasure. Even the dogs evinced an inherent perception of Waantha’s higher grade by fawning acknowledgment, while with the old chief the defiant acrimony increased rather than diminished. In habits the same characteristic features prevailed. In eating the old savage used as little ceremony as the dogs, and far less in the modest observance of the other requirements of nature; while the younger seemed to derive intense pleasure from cleanly imitations. With these instinctive demonstrations we will resume our descriptive course.
<br> 
<br> June 17.—The three previous days passed without any active indications on the part of our tracking foes, 47but during the twilight dawn of this morning Waantha discovered parties crossing the river in advance from the right to the left bank. With every safe opportunity fuel was renewed to guard against unforeseen emergencies. At noon large bodies of Indians were seen watching our progress from eminences inland, and the trees of either shore. Their appearance caused M. Hollydorf to question his duty in opposition to the prospect the adventure offered for the fulfillment of his commission. All, with the exception of Mr. Dow, expressed themselves in terms of discouragement. Dr. Baāhar depicted the horrors of a death from putrefactive poison, which entailed in life the lingering corruption of bodily decomposition, which even the vultures would disdain to hasten. Mr. Dow was obliged to acknowledge that the preoccupation of their thoughts, while engaged in field avocations, would expose them to certain surprise, and inevitable extermination. But he had set his heart upon the venture and pleaded the advantage that would accrue from the river’s exploration, hoping for some chance interposition for the furtherance of his enterprise. Captain Greenwood, for the relief of Mr. Dow, proposed that the exploration of the river should be continued as far as admissible for the safety of the steamer. M. Hollydorf accepted this proviso, notwithstanding the loss of time it would cause.
<br> 
<br> June 19.—While the captain and M. Hollydorf were engaged with the calculation of their meridian observations, just as the steamer was closing a long reach, Waantha hobbled aft in great excitement, pointing with energetic gesticulation to a headland we were approaching, and then to our guns on the forecastle deck. Interpreting some new emprise on the part of our savage foes, the boat was kept in the centre of the current, until the view opened beyond the headland, when in melée encounter were seen parties on horseback. 48On nearer approach women and children were discovered huddled together within a barrier of mules and horses. Parry, the engineer, always prompt with his weapon, sounded a parley, which caused a momentary cessation of hostilities, allowing the boat to gain a position commanding a full view of the parties engaged. A glance, aided by the imploring gestures of the women, whose garments and other indications bespoke an approach to civilized origin, at once enlisted the inclination of our sympathy. The novelty of a scene so unexpected, rendered us for a moment undecided how to act, but the sound of Antonio’s Chinese weapon restored our presence of mind. The Indians quickly recovering from the momentary panic, caused by the shriek of the whistle and clangor of the gong, engaged in a renewed charge upon the unfortunates, who were defending their families with the desperation of despair, and in numbers seemed scarcely one to ten of their foes. The charge of the Indians was accompanied with a derisive whoop, this was almost simultaneously echoed back by the bray of the mules opposed in forlorn hope, which revived Mr. Dow’s with a realizing perception of the ways and means for the achievement of his ambitious project. His rifle had reported the death of four Indians before a general volley put the survivors to flight. The rescued, when they saw the Indians fall and themselves spared, hastened down the bank that they might not interpose their bodies as shields to the savages. The panic of the Indians who were in flight over the pampa was increased by a shell, the report of the gun startling from the western shore a party lying in wait for the issue of the battle on the eastern, with the probable hopes of a chance advantage to themselves. Acting upon the hint that there were among them those who had witnessed the effect of shot and shell on a former occasion, the opportunity was embraced for reviving the impression. When 49satisfied that all able to molest had carried their bodies out of range, preparations were made for landing to succor the rescued with food and raiment, for they appeared to be in a deplorable condition.
<br> 
<br> Before landing for the personal expression of sympathy, the punt was loaded with provisions and dispatched to allay the immediate cravings of hunger. The steamer in the meantime was moored to a wood-rift, from which the captain and members of the corps gained the shore. They were received by a man past the middle age, whose face was exceedingly attractive, although wan with fatigue and anxiety. Momentarily embarrassed, as if with doubt of his capacity to make his emotions of gratitude intelligible, he bowed himself down with the intention of prostrating himself at the feet of the captain, but this act of humiliation was arrested by the grasp and hearty shake of his hands. As distress evokes compassionate emotions with the kind-hearted, the captain’s eyes were not alone mindful in the reciprocation of the stranger’s outburst of grateful tears. Quick in demonstration, when his generous impulses were aroused, the captain exceeded the cautious discretion that usually guarded his movements, from fear of imposition, by bestowing a hearty embrace of sympathy upon the careworn guardian of the rescued flock. This act caused, with one exception, a general prostration accompanied with a grateful outburst of tears. The exception to this indicative act of eastern humiliation, bestowed alike in reverence to the tyrant and benefactor, was a maiden who had probably numbered eighteen seasons. Tall and erect in stature, she stood unmindful of the prostrate throng, but not unmoved by the scene enacted between the representative leaders of the rescuers and rescued. The clear transparency of her skin, with the healthy purity of its texture, combined with a graceful form, exceeding in height those with whom she was associated, declared 50her at once alien to them by birth. Seemingly aware that grateful expressions confined to pantomimic enactment would at the close of the introductory scene prove embarrassing, she advanced, after securing with touch the companionship of two young maidens who had prostrated themselves beside her. Approaching Captain Greenwood, she addressed him in an unknown tongue, which M. Hollydorf with surprise recognized as an idiom of the Latin language. His wonder was augmented by her confident assumption that there were among us some who would be able to converse with her, and through her interpretation would be enabled to hold communication with her protectors, her companions speaking a dialect in remote correspondence with her own. The captain, although gratefully recompensed for his lack of language by the eyes of the fair vision, felt himself unaccountably moved in his isolation, notwithstanding she continued to bestow upon him from those members sympathetic admiration exceeding the compass of speech. The maiden announced herself as a native of Heraclea of the Falls, a walled city but a few days’ travel remote.
<br> 
<br> “My name,” she continued, “is Correliana Adinope, daughter of the Pr?tor Adinope, in body deceased, and step-daughter to Adestus the present Pr?tor. The city has sustained a constant siege for centuries by the savages in revenge for the wrongs committed against them by our ancestors. Its inhabitants are at the present time in the extremity of distress from pestilence engendered by famine. While endeavoring to obtain remedial plants without the city walls I was made prisoner by a band of our besiegers, and was rescued immediately by these fugitives, whom in turn you have saved from destruction.”
<br> 
<br> Having satisfied in outline the curiosity of M. Hollydorf, she begged that safe means of rest might be 51afforded her protectors, for they had been constantly harassed for weeks without an hour’s undisturbed sleep. But long before the preparations were completed for a comfortable resting place, Correliana and the wounded were the only ones that remained awake.
<br> 
<br> Waantha, assisted by the guacacioes of the crew, collected from the hair and mouths of the dead Indians antidotes, and from the growths of the river bank counteractive remedies, which relieved the excruciating pain of the wounded, and stayed the progress of gangrenous putrefaction. At sunset all the rescued were in a deep lethargic sleep, and as the night was pleasant, and the glade where they lay was open to the river, with a day draught that freed it from miasm, but little fear was apprehended from their exposure, notwithstanding the tattered condition of their clothing. Fortunately, before the evening was far advanced, the captain bethought himself of his trading stock, from which he soon obtained fabrics well adapted for their protection. Mr. Dow, restored to the full vigor of ambitious vitality, busied himself in organizing a guard for the protection of the mules and horses, listening the while to Aabrawa’s relation of their owner’s source, for he had recognized them as belonging to a colony located far to the eastward of his place of nativity, who were known to his people by the name of Bamboyles. Mr. Dow viewing his night charge as the keys destined to unlock the gates of his New Jerusalem, he picketed them in the most verdant portion of the glade. When morning dawned his fears were startled to find them still prone with scarcely a sign of vitality; and as his attempts to arouse them failed to elicit more than a drowsy snort he feared that with all his vigilance they had been poisoned, but was reassured by Dr. Baāhar, who pronounced their immobile condition as lethargic, induced from hunger and fatigue.
<br> 
<br> 52While the night dew was still on the foliage Waantha pointed to a long line of animals approaching the river from the plain, which proved to be llamas. Upon this hint the three marksmen took the steamer’s boat to find their “toch,” or path to the river, and were successful in securing a supply of game sufficient for several days’ consumption. Before his guests awoke the captain had prepared a tent for the reception of the women and children, and an abundance of food for all. In addition he was able to furnish from his trading stock dresses, which, with a little alteration, would supply the requirements of the women.
<br> 
<br> The mayorong, or chief of the Bamboyles, and Correliana were the first to awake in the morning; the latter, with her two companions, were conducted to the tent and there presented with the means of renewing their garments. In communicating the kindly expressions bestowed, with the gifts, her companions, in returning thanks, used the Spanish idiom, which startled Mr. Welson with pleasurable surprise, as it opened to him a direct avenue of speaking intercourse, for its varied provincialisms were as familiar to him as his patrial mother tongue. After the agreeable confusion, occasioned by Mr. Welson addressing them in Spanish, had subsided, the eldest introduced herself as Cleorita and her sister as Oviata Arcos, daughters of Don Santiago Arcos, a native of Madrid, the chief city of Spain. On hearing this announcement he became joyfully elated, bestowing upon both a fond recognition, as they were the daughters of a personal friend of former years. After a long conversation, in which they gave him an outline history of their people, and the cause that forced them to become wandering exiles from their loved country, with the distressful mishaps which had attended their search for a new home, they separated reluctantly for the day. In answer to Mr. Welson’s sympathetic desire to render burial assistance in the 53regretful disposal of their dead relatives, the mayorong replied, that unless their preservers especially wished to be present they would prefer to indulge in their sorrows alone. Readily understanding the motive, Mr. Welson and associates returned to the steamer while the ceremonies were in progress.
<br> 
<br> As Waantha had discovered Indian scouts lurking above and below upon either bank of the river, Mr. Dow exercised his engineering skill in forming on the pampa a defensive redoubt for the night protection of the horses and mules. Dr. Baāhar theoretically explained the Latin nomenclature of the different departments of the Roman castrum, which possessed from his natural and cultivated innocence from mechanical attaint the supreme “virtue” of novelty. Mr. Dow submitted to his classical dictations, but stoutly refused to adopt his method of fortification, which the doctor styled fossa cingere internus, or moating inside of the redoubt, notwithstanding the strongly urged advantage of its strategic intention of concealment, that would lead the savages, on gaining the summit of the embankment, to take a blind leap into it. Fortunately the padre was present to divert the argument, which enabled him to render practical assistance to his Bamboyle aids for the completion of the inclosure in time for the night’s occupation. The absence of the doctor and padre from the supper table caused the captain to inquire where they were? Mr. Dow said that he had left them but a short time previous seated on the sods of the embankment engaged in a dogmatic discussion of the feasibility of the various methods adopted by the ancients and moderns for citadel defense, the doctor quoting from “Plutarch’s Lives” and the padre from Bunyan’s “Holy War” as the best English authority. Aggravated by the heedless lack of sympathy shown in the use of their tongues, the while withholding the useful aid of their hands, the captain, on their appearance, reprimanded 54the doctor over the padre’s shoulders with tart severity, which caused both to give heed to the practical suggestions of Mr. Welson in train for the outfit of the overland expedition. From the direction of Correliana, who seemed to have an innate perception of her entertainers’ dispositions, the captain concluded to continue the voyage up the river to a point she described as more favorable for debarkation, as it was nearer the southern passes of the mountains that opened a way to the city of Heraclea.
<br> 
<br> June 21.—After the morning meal a majority of the women and children were brought on board of the steamer, and of the males all that would be likely to impede the progress of the land party having in charge the horses and mules. When ready for the start, the doctor joined the shore party equipped in naturalistic costume, which, in defiance of the recent sad experiences of the Bamboyle women, excited a mirthful inclination; even the more sedate demeanor of Correliana was moved in despite of her efforts to suppress her risible emotions. With his nether bifurcations disappearing, in extremity, within the capacious leg receptacles of boots, a blouse surcoat, or smock frock, elaborately supplied with Sanskrit labeled pockets, depended loosely from his shoulders, reaching to his knees, his head being surmounted with a bell-crowned hat, bestudded with impaling pins, technically called the kaleidoscope. Protruding from the larger pockets were seen the mouths of a pistol barrel, powder and drinking horns, with various articles for insect preservation.
<br> 
<br> Aware of his uncouth presentment, he pleaded that its adoption combined usefulness with policy, for he had noted in his travels that all tribes and nations bowed down in reverential worship and awe to ugliness; and he felt certain that he had often been indebted to the contributions of his costume for the preservation of his life, while sojourning among 55the natives of the Polynesian and Ladrone Islands. When fairly mounted upon a mule, who seemed to be affected with emotions peculiar to his species, but seemingly averse to awe and worshipful respect, Mr. Welson could not refrain from commending the happy conjunction as talismanic for the rider’s preservation from savage attacks.
<br> 
<br> It required much coaxing on the part of the mayorong to reconcile the mule to the novel eccentricities of its rider, but in the course of the forenoon he seemed to enter into the humor of his direction with unusual zest. When fully reconciled to the swaying of the doctor’s net, with the sharp turns and checks to which he was subjected in the chase of insects, the Bamboyles left them to the full sway of their own moods. Fortunately the saddle was well adapted to secure the safety of its occupant. As they were crossing the opening of a glade, when the day was well advanced, a splendid specimen of the pampa Nyctaloide hovered over the cavalada long enough to attract the doctor’s attention, then floated away, leisurely, over the plain. In a moment the insect-hunter’s net was in hand and, before he could be checked with warning caution, was under full headway in pursuit, and, when fully engaged in following the doublings of his quarry, he became deaf to the mayorong’s calls. Feeling secure in being able to keep within hail of the boat, the erratic movements of the doctor had been a source of amusement to the Bamboyles, but as the distance was narrowing between the foot-hills and the river, and withal hummocky, his danger increased. Still he was armed, and little fear was entertained for his safety, for while within call his mule could be brought back with a whistle. As he still kept heedlessly on, the mayorong sent a party of young men to bring him back. They had scarcely started, when a shrill shout from the mayorong urged them on, he and Mr. Dow following at full speed. The cause of these movements 56was a pursuing Indian close in the wake of the doctor. Unheedful of the danger, the doctor and his mule—who seemed to enjoy the novelty of the chase with his rider’s gusto—neared the foot-hills, where a band of Indians were seen watching the strange scene. His frantic gesticulations had undoubtedly impressed them with the belief that he was bestraught with madness; a condition held in especial reverence by aboriginals,—as they continued to regard the movements of the Indian in pursuit with negligent indifference; indeed, from his frequent hesitations, when within the cast of a spear, he seemed to be subject to the restraining influence of the same fear. The mayorong, who had allowed Mr. Dow to overtake him, had twice discharged his rifle in hopes that the report would apprise the doctor of his danger, so that he might use his pistol. But these offensive demonstrations only aggravated his danger, for the band of Indians moved rapidly forward for the rescue of their scout; he at the same time, warned by the rifle reports, cast a calculating glance backward to determine the extent of his own danger. At this juncture the butterfly rose and doubled just without the range of the distracted enthusiast’s net, then coquetted backward and forward with all the instinctive blandishments of its human type, showing as little concern for threatened danger as its pursuer. This tack brought the doctor face to face with his foe, who had sprung upright upon the croup of his horse, holding his spear poised ready for the cast. The cool indifference of the doctor to this offensive act, although within reach of the spear’s thrust, caused the savage to pause, backing his horse out of the way, as if still doubting the sanity of his meditated victim’s self-possession. In this act a bullet with the mayorong’s novice aim startled the savage from the close proximity of its whizz, as he started suddenly aside. A quick glance turned toward us determined the doctor’s 57fate just as he succeeded in capturing the tantalizing object of his chase. While in the act of lowering the staff of his net to remove his prize, he received the blow from the cast of the spear aimed at the unprotected portion of his head; the point glancing upward upon the skull divided the scalp on the forehead, reflecting it backward over the crown. The blow forced him backward from the saddle to the ground; at this stage Mr. Dow brought his rifle to bear, which caused the savage to bite the dust, just as he was about to finish his victim with a spear thrust. The blow and report brought back the doctor’s scattered senses in time to anticipate with his pistol an attempt upon his throat from the teeth of the Indian’s no less savage horse, for the completion of his dead master’s unfinished work. This instinctive impulse of self-preservation announced the presence of the doctor’s mind, and that he still survived, but the horse, deprived of life, fell forward over his prostrate body, as if to accomplish in death his defunct master’s intention. When dragged from beneath the horse Dr. Baāhar looked as if he had been resurrected from a slaughter-house, but he was a naturalist still, for his first thoughts were directed to his captured butterfly. A more striking contrast could scarcely be imagined than that presented by the captor and captured, the former being clothed in blood and the latter in beauty, for it had escaped injury in the conflict. After the doctor had examined the condition of his hat with its contents and garnish of insects, he submitted his head to the mayorong’s treatment, with the proviso that his restored scalp should be swathed without washing. When mounted on his mule his appearance was as fruitful of humorous mirth as those attending the most ludicrous mishaps of the valorous knight of La Mancha. The Indians, after the mayorong’s party left, held a consultation over the dead body of their scout, which seemed to result in a determination to avenge his 58death, for the main body, which outnumbered ours in the ratio of three to one, followed, standing on croup in a menacing attitude, occasionally making a dash forward, and as suddenly retreating. These maneuvers were continued for an hour or more, serving to retard the progress of the cavalada, until Mr. Dow, our rear guard, getting out of patience with their annoyance, proposed a long shot with his Spencer rifle which in effect astonished the Indians by dismounting one of the most defiant. This caused evident dismay, for they immediately retreated with all speed to the foot-hills, leaving us unmolested for the rest of the day’s stage. Notwithstanding the delays of the land party, they were obliged to wait at the first open glade until night-fall for the arrival of the steamer. After the doctor had submitted to a thorough ablution of body and head, administered by the Bamboyle women, the cause of the steamer’s delay was explained.
<br> 
<br> The steamer, after an hour’s progress from her night’s moorage, entered a broad expanse of water of lake-like dimensions formed by a confluent tributary from the west. The strong eddy caused by the making out of a spit from the eastern bank forced the boat to the opposite shore covered with the rank growths common to extensive alluvial deposits in semi-tropical latitudes. While the engine was exerting its utmost power to stem the current and cross the walled strength of the combined streams, Waantha, who was at his post with his canine friends, called Mr. Welson’s attention by signs to a broad spreading mangrove banian peculiar to the tributary deltas of the large South American rivers, which bear a strong resemblance to kindred growths in India. Among the pendant hybrid limbs, which had taken root in the muddy deposit, there appeared one that seemed to vibrate to and fro, coiling upon itself. With the glass the captain discovered that it was a huge amphibious 59anaconda hanging pendant from one of the horizontal branches by the prehensile attachment of its tail. The waving excitement of its corrugations and swaying reflection of its head from side to side, within circumscribed limits, aroused the spectators’ curiosity to learn the nature of its attraction. A nearer approach discovered, prone upon the interwoven platform of mangrove branches, a huge alligator with his head inward from the river. The reptile relation of the parties foreboded an instinctive encounter of sagacity and strength, which excited in Mr. Welson a strong repulsive desire to witness, as a comparative study, the result of a duel between individual representatives of species so nearly allied on the cold blooded verge of vitality. The captain, in order to afford him the privilege of recording the result for future reference, directed the bow of the boat cautiously toward the scene of encounter.
<br> 
<br> When sufficiently near to witness the movements of the monsters, who were engaged in preliminary tactics, one to prevent insinuating surprise; for the alligator, from his shrinking contractions, was evidently aware of the impending danger, if his foe was allowed to gain his object, and the other to excite the advantage he wished to gain, the headway of the boat was checked. As the distance intervening was shortened, the scaly tail, back, and immense snout of the alligator, were exposed to view in sidelong reflection within the umbrageous shadow, proclaiming him the patriarchal champion of his species, and well matched in strength to contend with his ophidian foe, should he, from tantalizing banter, proceed to actual hostilities. Gradually the serpent’s curves and retractions grew more energetic in gliding movement as its head darted hither and thither, now disappearing on one side of the saurian, then retracting over his back for an investigation of the opposite side, with the evident object of seeking a passage beneath. The alligator, although passive in 60his defensive movements, was observed to crouch closer to the underlying branches whenever the head of his foe touched a part beneath the scales of his armor, his apprehension being made manifest by a nervous twitching of his tail, as if aware of the fatal vantage sought.
<br> 
<br> The captain had requested the engineer to keep the steamer in position until the victor in the duelistic contest was determined; but the wariness of the alligator, who was not in a position to accept the wager of battle, made the result of the siege doubtful, as it might be prolonged until they had tested their respective powers of total abstinence to the extent of endurance. With the thought of his own culpability should the gratification of Mr. Welson’s curiosity prove fatal to the hopes of Correliana, who had placed her reliance in his direction for the relief of her kindred, he was about to request the engineer, who acted as pilot, to proceed, when the pagan exclamation proh Jupiter! from the object of his thoughts called attention to the cause. The alligator had attempted to gain the advantage of his preferred element by a backward movement, this act had opened to the head of his foe the sought for advantage, which had already passed underneath his body between his dwarfed legs before his hind quarters reached the water. In a twinkling two coils had involved the saurian’s body just behind his fore legs, the part most susceptible to wounds and compression. Then came a fearful struggle that swayed the tree attachments through the wide expanse of its reach, causing in the minds of the beholders a loathsome interest devoid of sympathy, offering the test of instinctive strength and endurance as a meagre source of gratification. Still, to Mr. Welson, the contest was not altogether devoid of useful application for parallel deduction when compared with the animal traits of human instinct. The tightening of the prehensile coil of the anaconda’s tail on 61the limb of its attachment, and upward retractile corrugations of his body with corresponding attenuation, disclosed the difficulty he encountered from the elasticity of his leverage, which prevented the concentration of muscular strength necessary for the strangulation of his victim. To the elasticity of the limb the alligator owed his prolonged existence and chance of advantageous retrieval. At this stage of doubtful emergency the instinctive “wisdom” of the serpent became meditatively apparent in the darting movements of his head and gleam of his watchful eyes, which were engaged in alert study to advantage his position, while guarding his straining body from the frantic strokes of the tail and distended jaws of his antagonist. The anaconda’s intention was soon made manifest, for we could plainly see his corkscrew tail traveling with insidious progress toward one of the main trunks of the tree; this once gained the moments of the saurian’s existence could be numbered, for it would afford the required resistance for crushing his body in its armor of proof. The “spectators” had watched the conflict with a superlative degree of indifference, inasmuch as favor for either of the contestants was concerned, hoping that both would be fatally disabled. But the moment the alligator began to manifest symptoms of exhaustion in the weakened strokes of its tail, and gasping throes, the human instinct of a guacho fireman sided with the weaker party in the struggle. Yet the object of his championship was scarcely a shade less repulsive than the symbolic cause of man’s squirming meanness and disposition to involve in his folds of treachery all that adventure within the reach of his cupidity. The alligator’s champion, born and nursed in the saddle with the lariat and bola for his rattle, asked the captain, in an undertone, for the skiff, with permission to terminate the combat. This granted he soon gained a footing upon the mangrove thicket and in a few 62seconds the quick gleam of a machéte was seen, then with the accompaniment of a prolonged hiss the serpent’s writhing body fell separated from its tail. Relaxing the portion inclosing his nearly lifeless victim, he strove with instinctive energy to release his folds, but his efforts were vain, for the retractile power of his muscles had departed with his tail. Helplessly retained by the dead weight of the alligator’s body, the serpent seemed at a loss to account for the futile result of his efforts, for he continued to retract his bereaved stump, while investigating with darting head the progress effected by vermicular contraction beneath. The reviving spasms of the alligator increased the anxious rapidity of the anaconda’s movements, but as with the fabled flight of Samson’s strength shorn of his locks, he was held for sacrifice bound in the toils of his own instinctive intention. His helpless condition was aggravated by the guacho, who, after cutting away the intervening branches, was seen struggling with the writhing tail until he had drawn it to an overreaching limb, from which he dropped it within reach of the head of its late owner. Its detached appearance seemed to impress upon the majority, of the relict anaconda, the diminished extent of his misfortune, for it was seized with its late mouth and bitten with impotent rage. While engaged in inflicting punishment upon its supposed traitorous tail, instinctive caution was made blind with rage, and its coils, released by the recovered consciousness of the alligator, convolved athwart between his open jaws which seized and severed the serpent’s body while its head was endeavoring to execute ultimate vengeance by swallowing its recreant tail. M. Hollydorf and Mr. Welson closed the scene and the alligator’s repast with their rifles, the bullets taking effect in the soft parts which were exposed in his endeavors to regain the water. With this humane addenda to the reptile duel, the serpent’s head was left to shuffle off from 63its mortal coil. Correliana Adinope and the Bamboyle women had screened themselves from the revolting sight under the awning aft, from which they could not be induced to look backward until the scene of the duel was left far behind. The steamer, to make good the time lost, was urged to her best speed. With the relation of these retarding incidents of the day, Antonio announced his readiness to serve the evening meal.
