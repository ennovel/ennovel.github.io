CHAPTER I.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      In the month of January, 187-, M. Hollydorf was selected to conduct an exploring corps of the R. H. B. Society to the head waters of the Paraguay and its tributaries, for the purpose of observing the habits and classifying the different species of animalcular life native to the trees and plants appertaining to those regions. The Royal Society had supplied him with able assistants, and the most complete set of instruments ever constructed for botanical or other research in the fields of natural science. Among the instruments of recent invention, was one of Lutsenwitz’s solar reflecting microscopes, especially designed for field explorations. This was of the highest concentrated power yet attempted by that artist,—the intensity of its magnifying capacity being capable of showing the facial contortions of the most minute animalcul?. Attached to the focal platform was one of Phlegmonhau’s highest grade of responsive tympanums, with reflecting auricle for magnifying the articulation of sound. The corps arrived at Montevideo on the first day of April, and was fortunate in finding a small trading steamer, under neutral colors, ready with quick despatch for a barter voyage up the Paraguay and its tributaries, without a specified port of final destination.
<br> 
<br> 2The captain was sole owner, and proved to be a man of rare intelligence, which had been cultivated by travel and study. To his love of adventure was added a strong amateur predisposition for the pursuits of natural history. These qualifications led to a speedy agreement, with conditional arrangements for a charter of the steamer open to variations suited to the requirements of the corps.
<br> 
<br> On the 15th of April the members of the corps, instruments, camp utensils, and travelling gear, were safely stowed on board the little steamer Tortuga,—a name that implied slow progress, which to our satisfaction her speed decried. At eleven A. M., having bid farewell to our newly acquired friends, we left the anchorage with their “Good speed,” and after threading her way among the vessels in the roadstead the little steamer puffed her way up the broad expanse of the La Plata estuary. The balance of the day was occupied in arranging instruments for river observations, the while listening to praises lavished by the captain upon the “worthy” qualities of his little propeller, of which he was the architect and builder. During the evening he regaled us with incidents of his life in California and the East Indies. His adventures in California received occasional illustrations from a genial individual introduced as Padre Simon, the prefix having been conferred—as we afterwards learned—from his zealous support of the Catholic dogmas, theoretically. As the padre was eventually enlisted in our corps, we will foreshadow some of his peculiar characteristics. In form he was of medium height, with a rotund outline visibly inclining to jovial obesity; his face was in-dyed with a complexion blending with the Roman auburn of his hair, which gave a warm glow to his expression when lighted with a smile. In the first generation of descent from Irish parentage, he retained the full impression of inconsistency 3in the practical adaptation of his habits to the faithful index of goodness ingrafted from the maternal stock. Guileless in thought, when free from temptation, he possessed a ready facility of excusing his habits of excess with the plea of saving grace administered under the seal of confession. With this hint, in forecast of development, we will proceed in the relation of events transpiring during the river voyage.
<br> 
<br> On the morning of the 21st of May, after having been subjected to our full share of vexatious delays, incident to the provincial poco pocoism of the guarda and custom-house officials, the steamer gained the river post of Santa Anna on the Pilcomayo, two miles above its mouth. At Santa Anna they found the well-known American naturalist, Diego Dow, waiting for an opportunity to obtain sufficient aid to attempt the exploration of the Pilcomayo as far as the reputed settlement of Tenedos, which rumor located on a confluent stream rising and flowing eastward through the valleys of the Andean spur that reached into central La Plata.
<br> 
<br> The ultra-savage disposition of the wandering tribes on the banks of these rivers, having defeated every previous attempt made to establish trading-posts, but few had been found willing to incur the hazard proposed by Mr. Dow. Even the indomitable Jesuits had been foiled in all their endeavors to conciliate the Indians in degree sufficient for the establishment of missions preliminary to their subjugation.
<br> 
<br> The magnet of Mr. Dow’s desire had been drawn thitherward by the reputed existence of a walled city inhabited by a white race of great beauty. He considered the report sufficiently well authenticated to warrant the adventure of his life for its discovery and relief from the constant siege to which it had been subjected by the savage tribes from time beyond date. His chief authority, which had incited him to engage 4in the emprise, was his Auraucanian servant, who had, in his wanderings and progress northward, served in an Indian marauding expedition, which invaded the valley of the city for the purpose of lifting the cattle of the inhabitants, who were in seasons of drought obliged to protect them while feeding beyond the walls. As Indian forays were expected, the herds were well guarded by shepherd escorts, whose persons were safely protected with defensive armor, so that with the exception of the face the other parts of the body were proof to the poisoned arrows. In addition they were armed with a bow which in their practiced hands sent the arrow sure to its mark far beyond the range of their savage foes’ weapons, so that in the open valley they were safe. Besides, their tactics embraced so many precautionary variations that the Indians were almost invariably decoyed and blinded from real intention. These feints caused the savages to become over wary, never venturing an attack unless with the advantage of overwhelming numbers. The party with which Aabrawa, Mr. Dow’s servant, was engaged, met with a severe repulse that indisposed them to renew the attempt, notwithstanding an opportunity was offered on the succeeding day. So well managed were the citizens’ plans of protection that they rarely lost either men or cattle, and without being aggressive frequently administered well merited punishment upon their foes, who were inspired with wholesome fear from a superiority so manifest in deadly effect. Unable to cope with their white antagonists in the open field, they, with constant wariness peculiar to the savage, neglected no opportunity to harass, hoping at some time with constant worrying to catch them off their guard. The cause of this implacable hatred was hereditary, reaching, as Aabrawa learned, far back to a time when the forefathers of the citizens abused their supremacy by enslaving their Indian benefactors. The Indians having surprised and overcome their oppressors, 5a remnant of the whites obtained refuge in the present city, which had since been kept under constant espial. As the city was overlooked from an adjacent height, but little passed in the streets unknown to the besiegers, who were quick to discover any relaxation of vigilance; and whenever from pestilence or other cause it did occur, couriers were dispatched to summon aid from distant tribes.
<br> 
<br> Curiosity and love of exciting adventure had enlisted the members of the corps in favor of aiding Mr. Dow’s projected enterprise, and through their continued solicitation, M. Hollydorf consented to waive the strict interpretation of his commission, designating a particular field of operation, by using his discretionary power in favor of the proposed scheme for raising the siege of the beleaguered city. Captain Greenwood without hesitation tendered the aid of his steamer, and being one of those peculiar persons who are accustomed to take the head of time by the forelock, he immediately commenced the precautionary labors to protect his vessel from the wily tricks of surprise practiced by the savages. The commandante of Santa Anna, being well acquainted with the methods of attack that led to the defeat of the various expeditions directed against the Chacas, proved of great use in suggesting precautions. The chief dread arose from the poisoned arrows of the savages, which inflicted incurable wounds, adding to death the horrors of lingering putrefaction. The fears anticipated from this source were relieved by the confidence inspired through the energetic character of the captain, whose experience with the superior cunning of the North American Indians prepared him to cope with the lower instincts of their southern congeners.
<br> 
<br> On the morning of the 23d of May the Tortuga’s bow was turned against the swift middle current of the Pilcomayo’s bayou expanse, then at its height 6from the copious contributions of the rainy season in the high lands and mountain sources of its tributaries. Night still found us in the broad sea of waters, baffled in search of the interior mouth which was made more difficult from the confluent branches uniting with it near its Paraguayan embouchure. The commandante, anticipating the difficulty likely to be encountered, had been particular in giving directions; but although strictly followed, from a calculation of the steamer’s speed, twice the distance had been run without discovering the described landmarks. Uncertainty was rendered still more uncomfortable by the shallowing of the water, showing plainly that we were inland from the river’s channel. At midnight, while anchored, a hurricane, heralded by a thunder-storm, made the waters seethe with its force, causing our little craft to careen and bob with a politeness to the gusts that impaired our confidence in its self reliance. Padre Simon declared that the lightning set his teeth on edge, prompting him from its dazzling flashes to pray, but that the thunder so startled and confused him that he was unable to think, and as a dernier ressort was obliged to drink. This remedy finally rendered him proof to the best efforts of Jupiter Tonans; but on waking in the morning he complained that he could still hear the roll of the thunder in his head.
<br> 
<br> On the morning of the 24th the sun rose bright and clear in a cloudless sky, compensating with its splendor the discomforts of the night; its reflected light glancing upon the waters discovered far to the south a broad ripple, indicating the sought-for channel. The river’s stream was soon gained, and followed in a southwesterly course until the river’s limits were defined by partially submerged trees growing upon its banks. Having at Santa Anna filled every available portion of the vessel with fuel, sufficient for a run of four days, the boat was enabled to keep on her course 7under a full head of steam, without anxiety from the dull prospect offered for replenishing.
<br> 
<br> May 25th, at sunrise, after a good night’s run, we discovered a headland above the surface of the water covered with fire-scathed trees, from which the captain, for a surety, concluded to add to his diminished supply of fuel. The labor of taking in wood from this source was by no means pleasant, but the sailors with good-will made the “virtue of necessity” cheerful with songs and jokes, the “passengers,” suitably clothed, contributing with the zest of energy their labor for its stowage, so that by eight o’clock we were again under way. With the exception of this wooded bluff nothing but sky, water, and foliage had met our eyes since leaving Santa Anna, the monotonous compound making us well content with cabin associations.
<br> 
<br> On the 28th at sunrise, our ears were gladdened with the cry of “Land ho!” Rushing on deck, with the expectation of a greeting from well defined banks, we were disappointed, as the contrasted elements of the previous day still prevailed. Seeing that we were a little inclined to be vexed, at what we considered to be an ill-timed joke, the man at the wheel, an old river navigator, pointed to a mud bank that closed our view with the bend of the river, at the same time directing our attention to the eddy cast from it far out toward a line of trees on the opposite shore. From these indications he assured us that in a half hour’s time we should hear the songs of birds to make us lively. Doubling the muddy cape we were greeted with the screams of parrots, while other birds of gay plumage were crossing and recrossing the river singly and in flocks, causing, in apparent salutation, a lively line of demarcation between the land enclosed current and the smooth waters of the flood below. The welcome sight raised our spirits into a sympathetic mood of song, which was unfortunately too nearly allied to the screaming discord of the parrots to evoke other 8than a mirthful disposition for repartee which expended itself in humorous comparisons, favoring the advent of genial omens.
<br> 
<br> Mr. Welson, a prominent official of the Panama Railroad Company, had accepted the freedom proffered by the steamship lines plying between the maritime cities of the eastern coast of South America, for his recuperative vacation of three months, and on his arrival in Montevideo had been induced by Captain Greenwood to extend his voyage up the river.
<br> 
<br> A Scotsman by birth, he possessed in an eminent degree the predilection of his people for dry, caustic humor; and in his position of commercial agent had cultivated the art of extracting fun from the vagaries of migrating humanity in their transit across the isthmus. Scientific whimsies were especially adapted to his quizzical vein, and a happier combination of material could scarcely have been conjured for his entertainment, than he found on board of the Tortuga. Padre Simon was his especial favorite as a stimulating provocative. Won by his na?ve simplicity, he had soon interested himself to learn the object of his river voyage, with the intention of rendering him assistance. Greatly to his surprise the padre informed him that he had no other expectations in visiting Entre Rios than the chance one “of hitting an opportunity to make a strike.” Amused with his vernacular, and the easy carelessness of his manner, which seemed to defy disappointment, he was delighted to discover his growing fondness for polemical disputations, which was gratified by a kindred disposition cultivated by Dr. Baāhar, the naturalist of the corps. On the steamer’s arrival at Entre Rios, the port of his destination, the padre’s thoughts were absorbed in the dogmatic discussion of the soul’s material identity with the body after the resurrection, so that he gave no heed to the frequent repetition of the name of the town. Aware of his total abstraction from all 9thoughts and anxieties connected with the business responsibilities of life, necessary for material sustenance, Mr. Welson connived with the doctor to hold him in argument until after the steamer’s departure, well assured that no material harm could arise from the derangement of plans so lightly impressed as to give place to chimerical argument. For a characteristic illustration of the disputants’ peculiarities we will give the burden of their colloquial subjects of exposition.
<br> 
<br> Padre. “My conscience’ sake alive, man! Why, you might as well set us down as beasts at once, as to argue that in resurrection we shall assume the form of animals whose habits we most affect in life! Surely your naturalistic learning has run mad with your orthodox catholic ideas, for, upon my soul, they are rank with transmigration, and if confessed, you would be denied absolution by every ecclesiastic in the Christian world. Look you! the very fact, if admitted, would controvert all that we hold sacred. Why, man, it would render absurd our reliquary faith in the efficacy of sainted bones and vestments for healing the sick and lame, for the marrow-bones of swine and the hair of dogs would hardly serve to enlist belief in the Christian doctrine of divine transubstantiation?”
<br> 
<br> Dr. B. “As we claim that reason has been bestowed as an endowment to distinguish us in reality from the brute creation, its possession presupposes preordination of intention in decree for its use. Now, if you will devote your share of this human endowment to the demonstration I am about to give of cause and effect, you will not fail to perceive the distinctions upon which our faith is founded. Humanity possesses omnivorously, in its varieties of genera and species, all the habits of the lower orders of the animal creation in their separate representation! But superadded to this resemblance in the community of instinct, man has a 10discretionary power inherent with his endowment of reason, which enables him to profit by experience in shaping his course for the avoidance of consequent evils which follow from the transgression of natural laws. This power presupposes accountability that directs itself to Creative Cause. Upon this innate feeling of responsibility, impressed by repentance from transgressions, and joys imparted from adherence to the monitor indications of our superiority, man has founded his religious distinctions of vice and virtue. In furtherance of this natural division man has volunteered to represent vice, and woman, unprejudiced by his influence, would have naturally assumed the role of virtue in truthful vindication of her vocation as the mother of our race. Now, as you well know, it is impossible to harmonize vice and virtue, even with the instinctive coalescence of the sexes? Hence, as you must acknowledge, there will be a constant struggle for ascendency. Man as the stronger of the two, in representative selfish determination, and the moral force of muscular strength, is as full of devices for the beguilement of woman from her sacred trust as the variations of his ability admit.”
<br> 
<br> Padre. “Yes, all that may be true; but you don’t talk at all like yourself, and I can’t see what you have said has to do with revealed religion.”
<br> 
<br> Dr. B. “Why, its connection is self suggestive; virtue and vice in sexual array, for the supremacy of example, naturally oppose to each other their attractions and temptations. Fortunately, the harmonizing beauty of woman, with loving affection, impressed on the rude selfishness of man the preferred happiness of a home subject to graceful refinements, and with her sex in the majority held his passions and appetites of instinct in abeyance. To overcome this tacit rule man devised a series of temptations to hold her in subjugation to his control. These were addressed to her vanity and envy, incited by the jealous instigations 11of man’s preferment on the score of beauty. This led to artificial adornment, which placed the means of temptation in the hands of man. Then, as a plea for the encouragement of virtue, religious revelations were instituted under the conjurations of mystery to control, with fear, superstitious simplicity.”
<br> 
<br> Padre. “Perhaps I don’t quite understand you, for I can scarcely account for my own thoughts as they seem to be so mixed with new impressions; but if I understand what you express in words, I will answer for myself that the revealed way of salvation is to use all the blessings of life with moderation.”
<br> 
<br> Mr. Welson. (Amused.) “With the doctor’s permission, you will perhaps appreciate an illustration that occurs to me? Woman’s naturally unselfish affection, unbiased by the temptations of vanity and envious curiosity, exerts with gentle forbearance a restraint upon the more brutal appetites of man, softening asperities provoked by over indulgence. Theodosius, the emperor champion of Christianity, opened a way for the incursions of northern barbarians by patronizing the intolerant sway it usurped over the more primitive and lenient rites of paganism, as it weakened, by the introduction of effeminate luxuries which allied the sexes for degeneration.”
<br> 
<br> Padre. “I have never been much of a book-worm, but it appears to me if man, as Dr. Baāhar says, represents vice and woman virtue, your college learning directly tends to the cultivation of a vicious course by keeping before the people the barbarous acts of the ancients derived from their own language, which gives the scholar a directing power, from a studied understanding of the corruptions practiced in past ages. So you see, it’s far better for woman, and the world at large, that she’s denied the means of classical study; for from your own admissions, her curiosity and envious vanity rages so greatly at the present 12day she’d be more likely to play the part of a Cleopatra than a Zenobia. As the world runs, I think the less we know of the past the better it will be for our salvation.”
<br> 
<br> Mr. W. “But you forget church history, padre, from the record of which you derive your knowledge of the fathers?”
<br> 
<br> Padre. “Well, but that is different from profane, for it teaches us the way of salvation by saving grace.”
<br> 
<br> Mr. W. “Yes, through the tender mercies of the Inquisition.”
<br> 
<br> Mr. Dow. “As a listener I must acknowledge that you have each with good arguments strangely confounded your former selves.”
<br> 
<br> The above colloquial rejoinders will serve as an illustration of the attraction that beguiled the padre’s attention until the second day after he had passed his port of destination. Then inquiring of the captain the distance that still “intervened,” the supposed number of miles being given, he relapsed into his usual routine without suspecting that it was calculated from the stern instead of the bow. When informed at the port of Rosas that the town of “Three Rivers” had been passed some days previous, he exclaimed, “My goodness gracious, there was where I wished to stop; my conscience’ sake alive, what shall I do?” The captain, to whom he appealed, answered by asking, “What did you intend to do at Entre Rios, padre?”
<br> 
<br> Padre. “A brokerage business of some sort, real estate or sugar, whichever offered the best opening.”
<br> 
<br> Captain. “But, padre, you cannot speak the language, which would render your expectations abortive, for a bargain is never closed in these countries without a great deal of word chaffering. A clear understanding of the language is absolutely necessary, for the inhabitants of the river towns are very apt to “fly” from a bad bargain when they find themselves 13caught and lightly held, so that the only safe way to secure them is to clip their wings and hood-wink them in black and white. But I can send you back without cost when we meet the next downward bound steamer; then you will have the advice and assistance of Mr. Welson, who perfectly understands the habits and customs of the people.”
<br> 
<br> Padre. “Well, I declare to gracious, I hardly know what to do?”
<br> 
<br> Captain. “Would you like employment on board? I think that there is a berth that would suit you! Besides it will afford you an opportunity to convince Dr. Baāhar of his errors; at the same time you can perfect yourself in speaking Spanish.”
<br> 
<br> Notwithstanding the captain’s quizzical looks and speech the padre thankfully accepted the proffered position of second officer, with the expressed hope that he might perform its duties in an acceptable manner. Captain Greenwood, although somewhat crispy in speech and austere in address, had a strong undertow of humorous appreciation when the shafts of irony were not directed against himself. His disinterested disposition, prompted by the padre’s kindly vis inerti?, had suggested the offer; nevertheless he really desired a person capable of superintending small matters that would relieve him from a responsibility not greatly to his relish. The duties imposed by the captain were as follows: “You must be the first up in the morning and the last in bed at night. While on duty, see that everything in the way of labor is well done, and never interfere with advice when a helping hand is required. Lastly, never report to me necessary changes until after they have been made.”
<br> 
<br> Padre. “But, captain, if I am never to speak how am I to improve or correct to suit you?”
<br> 
<br> Captain. “With the moral influence of your head and hands, when you see anything necessary to be done!”
<br> 
<br> 14This settled the question of the padre’s new vocation, and he was forthwith introduced to the crew, who greeted his installation with marked approbation. At night, when he became genial in confessional overflow and dogmatic in argument, he was the source of humorous repartee and good-will among the passengers on the quarter-deck. His American birth having toned down the quarrelsome disposition legitimate as an inheritance to the native-born Irishman, when under the influence of whiskey, he indulged in quaint disputations, peculiar to his Yankee ingraft, in freedom from ill humor.
<br> 
<br> With this insight descriptive of mood foreign to the members of the corps, we will now resume our narration of events transpiring in the daily progress of the steamer’s river voyage.
<br> 
<br> May 28.—The banks of the river are now clearly defined, but the water still submerges the undergrowth that margins its lower stages in the season of drought; the more matured growths are already peopled with the smaller species of birds delighting in the bushy retreats overhanging the waters. Our naturalists’ eyes are now greedily engaged in busy search for new specimens of the feathered species.
<br> 
<br> May 29.—This morning we reached a sand-spit formed by a confluent stream, upon which the receding waters had left a wood-drift well suited for the steamer’s use, having been forced by the jam of flood-tide high out of the current. The eddies and backwater of the Pilcomayo’s stronger flow had carried the raft and lodged it high up above the mouth of the lesser stream, leaving an extension inter-stayed by the roots that reached into deep water; alongside of the raft, in the smaller stream, the steamer moored. The axes of the firemen and sailors were soon busy, wakening for the first time the forest echoes to the chucking sound of their strokes. The more active members of the corps volunteered their services in aid for speedy 15replenishment, deriving in recompense the invigorating novelty of exercise. While actively engaged with ready hands and merry voices they were suddenly startled with the scream of the steamer’s whistle, simultaneously accompanied with a flight of arrows from the ambush of the forest screen above the raft. Fortunately distance and trepidation from the unearthly screech of the whistle rendered their aim harmless; the check it afforded enabled the woodcutters to scramble up the sides of the steamer before the savages recovered from their surprise. When they realized that the shriek was harmless in effect, the Indians rushed forth from their concealment to secure the axes which had been abandoned by the men in their sudden fright, but were again momentarily intimidated by the rumbling sound of the gong, which Antonio, the steward, had seized to increase with concerted din the scream of the whistle. The savages’ hesitation was but momentary, seeing that like the former the steward’s overture was harmless in effect, then with a counter whoop of defiance they sprang forward to secure the coveted prizes. But the second diversion brought with it presence of mind and time for the use of more effective weapons than empty sound. One of the two howitzers, which had been taken as freight to Santa Anna, the commandante loaned to Captain Greenwood for the voyage; this had been loaded as a precautionary measure the day previous, and intrusted to the charge of Jack and Bill, two sailors who had “shipped” on the river voyage for a “lark.” With thoughts trained to the duty of their charge they were the first that reached the steamer’s deck, and before the savages recovered from their second hesitation sighted the gun and answered their whoop with a discharge of grape, with an effect that left five of their number stretched on the logs, killed outright, the others in quick retreat leaving a trail of blood showing from its copious flow the infliction 16of dangerous wounds. The retreating savages in their turn dropped clubs, spears, blow-pipes, and arrows, so that there was but little danger of their return. But the premonition caused the captain to place a guard in a position to command the isthmus, accompanied by two hounds belonging to Mr. Dow. The dogs following the bloody trail soon gave intimation that they had discovered the wounded savages. Proceeding cautiously into the thicket beyond the abattis they found near together, an elderly savage and a boy of seventeen or eighteen years, both severely wounded. The padre, with heedless but kindly intention, attempted to raise the head of the old Indian upon his arm to relieve his uncomfortable position, while the others stanched his wounds. In a second from the time the padre’s arm came within reach of the savage, his teeth were fastened upon the arm above the elbow, while with working tenacity he used his utmost energy to penetrate the sleeve of his coat. His intention was evident from the greenish slaver that oozed from the corners of his mouth, betraying in appearance the characteristics of the dreaded poison. Bill, who was near at hand, relieved the padre from the danger of poisonous inoculation, before the teeth of the savage had penetrated the cloth, by the introduction of a marlin-spike with a decisive force that showed but little care for their preservation. The boy was more tractable, permitting his captors to handle him as they pleased. Two other savages were overtaken dragging themselves from bush to bush. When surrounded they were still defiant, threatening all who approached with spear-heads attached to short staffs; these were finally struck out of their hands, but they still repelled peaceful overtures, making a formidable show of resistance with teeth and nails. We had been specially warned against coming into close quarters with them by an old trader, who had frequently encountered their ferocious tendencies in 17his travels. Finding all our conciliatory attempts futile the wounded savages were left to their fate. Adopting the padre’s suggestion, the young Indian and his savage companion were taken on board, with the intention of trying the effect of kind treatment, but a lasso in the practiced hands of a guacho was required to persuade the latter to accept the proffered hospitality of the boat. Aside from the comparative docility of the boy, his lack of resemblance in feature and general conformation plainly declared that his subserviency to the will of his companion did not arise from parental affection. Shackling them to the windlass they were placed under the guardianship of the dogs, whose favorite lounge was on either side of the bowsprit heel beneath the shadow of the chocks. After they were secured, all hands, with the exception of the engineer, steward, and cooks, resumed their labors on the raft. As the padre insisted that it was a barbarous shame to throw the bodies of the dead savages into the water to become the food of alligators, when a few minutes’ labor would make them a decent grave in the sand, he was allowed the privilege of extending to the defuncts the rites of burial. As the spade in his hands had not been a favorite specialty during the more elastic periods of his existence under the benign influence of temperate heat, the torrid glow of the morning acting in concert with a stimulant he had taken to steady his nerves, caused a sweltering perspiration that in no way accelerated the progress of his pious undertaking. The sands having become quick from recent saturation were constantly caving, so that in addition to aggravation he was in danger of becoming a victim to his sextonic benevolence. While trying to extricate himself from the caving sand, the while vainly pleading for assistance from the laughing spectators of his disaster, his attention became fixed upon an array of yellow nuggets which he had overlooked when thrown from their 18bed with the sand. His silence and curious investigation with hands and eyes extorted the inquiry, “What is it, padre?” The laconic answer, “Gold!” brought the whole party to his rescue, including the sentinels from the logs above, while the engineer, steward, and cook deserted their posts in greedy haste. When the truth of his announcement was verified they with some difficulty dragged him from his grave, then oblivious to thoughts of savage surprise and poisoned arrows, they consigned the dead to the river, without remonstrance from the padre, and with flushed avidity commenced with spade and pan to unearth the precious metal. Mid-day, with its heat, found them still engaged, heedless of danger from the sun’s rays and the miasmic current converging upon the spit from the confluent streams. Silence alternating with wild bursts of hilarity, caused the captive savages, chained to the steamer’s windlass, to gaze with wondering looks of amazement.
<br> 
<br> Through the day, until darkness precluded the possibility of detecting the golden grains, the wild search continued, then when collected on the steamer’s deck they bethought themselves of the dangers to which they had been exposed. Although resolved to be more cautious in future while gathering their golden trove, its tangible presence banished fear; still as a thoughtful precaution the steamer was dropped into the stream as a guard against surprise.
