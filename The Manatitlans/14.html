Hollydorf interrupted the Dosch, with the assurance that he was fully convinced not only of the actual existence of animalculan humanity, but of the tangible wisdom of Manatitlan providence, shown in their inauguration of rational system for educational discernment, necessary for the fulfillment in life of happy intention. “But the difficulty of making the home society realize by letter the multiplying wonders in the course of our discoveries, puzzles my invention for a credible method of imparting the information without subjecting my sanity and integrity to impeachment. If you can, in your wisdom, resolve me how I may absolve myself with credit in my official correspondence, I shall certainly feel grateful.”
<br> 
<br> The Dosch smilingly assured him that he had no occasion for fear, as the sensational novelty of truthful record, with a little auramental aid rendered by the Manatitlans in the substitution of thought, would suffice for the ready adoption and belief of his report, as a marvelous indication of the age, in evidence of rapid progression under German lead. With this closing advisorial suggestion the Dosch and his companions departed for Manicul?.
<br> 
<br> The abstracted mood, fitful and irrelevant conversation, with the daily convocations of the four conservators of the Manatitlan secret, in the house under the northern temple’s eastern wall, did not fail to attract the wondering curiosity of their associates. But 144as M. Hollydorf had emancipated the members of the corps from field duty, they found no lack of pleasing occupation in rendering useful aid to the Heracleans. Doctor Baāhar had enlisted the padre, for a quid pro quo, in the pursuit of butterflies; the two curators of sound engaged in herding and woodland pursuits; Jack and Bill, under Heraclean and Kyronese instruction, engaged in “navigating” a small garden plot in the latifundium, with amusing success, while Viscouswitzs, the artist, wooed the Indian maids of the Vermejo tribe.
<br> 
<br> The Dosch, in continuation of his historical sketch of the Manatitlans, passed to the period noted as the Heraclean epoch.
<br> 
<br> The third century of your Christian era was well advanced before they were aware that there was a race of white gigas occupying a city not far remote from Manicul?. At that period distance was measured by the time occupied in conveyance by the insects then in use for transportation; but as the vitality of their bodies was subject to deciduous tenure, travelers were obliged to confine their researches within the limits of populated districts, between which adventitious paths were well defined. The defective means of communication with remote Manatitlan provinces had ever been a source of sincere regret. Still the lack of advancement in the art of locomotion had never interfered with the actual realization of happiness. The wood roach and beetle were used as insects of draught in the preparation of the soil for cultivation, and the flea for equisaltation, it being the favorite mount for distant journeys and pleasure excursions. The first innovation upon these time honored extra locomotive adjuncts, was effected by the persevering ingenuity and daring courage of a medium named Bussee. He had from an early age devoted his thoughts to natural history with the practical intention 145of improving the native stock which was too diminutive to be made available for transportation. As a boy he had been noted for a quick practical judgment, displayed in his ability to eke out from scant means the fulfillment of a desired end. Many of his improved domestic utensils are still in use, in evidence of an inventive genius in advance of his age. His habits were erratic, showing an impatience that disdained restraint within the bounds of precedental usage. Still his affectionate desire to confer public benefits attracted a grateful solicitude whenever his absence was unusually prolonged. But as he rarely returned without some valuable acquisition, confidence in his ability for self-protection waived anxiety. At length an absence of two months without communicating with his family, aroused public sympathy to such a pitch that a search was decided upon. In preparation the citizens of Manicul? had collected in the anthemique to consult upon the most feasible means of conducting the search.
<br> 
<br> When the direction was decided upon, and they were issuing forth for its prosecution, they were startled by the gyrations of an apis isolata (solitary bee) in close proximity to their heads. After a few eccentric evolutions which excited a commensurate degree of alarm, their fears were relieved by a shout of laughter in the jovial tones of the absentee, who, by a skillful direction, caused the bee to alight in their midst. When sufficiently assured of freedom from danger, his parents and the Dosch approached near enough to obtain a view of his mechanical appliances for guiding his prize. Between the wings of the bee, upon his back, a net with latticed films, supported in dome shape by stiff fibres, was attached. This turret was retained in place by filaments, which passed beneath his body, in the articulation between the body and thorax, so that his movements and winged action were not impeded. To the antenn?, on either side, 146were attached filamental guides, or reins, for directing his course, the proximal extremities being coupled within the pilot cone. When assured of the strength and security of the attachments, the Dosch and parents of Buzzee ventured on a short experimental flight. As the insect circled, in company with his mate, to gain a bee line, the daring volantaph caused him to execute a variety of intricate evolutions, which at first alarmed his passengers, who expostulated with him in reproof for his temerity. But when he explained his wish to show them how completely the movements of the bee were under his control, they no longer offered objections, their fears being turned to admiration. When satisfied that air flights could be conducted with more ease, safety, and swiftness, beyond the most sanguine expectations of ancient or modern Manatitlan prognosticators, his enterprise was highly commended. When landed the Dosch and advisors expressed a desire, in behalf of the people, to listen to a relation of his adventures in the anthemique, as it would be the means of avoiding rehearsals from hearsay, with the defects that of necessity were attendant upon individual versions. An hour before evening song the anthemique was thronged with the citizens of Manicul? anxious to hear Buzzee’s relation of the expedients used for a capture so important in its prospective bearings to the people of Manatitla. To enhance the clearness of his demonstration, and at the same time show the dazed docility of the bee, Buzzee directed his flight to the cantilor’s rostrum, and after he had settled addressed the assemblage from the pilot cone, in substance, as follows:—
<br> 
<br> “Although no stranger to your manifestations of affection, I am well aware that in appearance I have been remiss in rendering you suitable returns; but am certain that your confidence in the integrity of my intentions will exculpate me from meditated indifference. I am now happy in being able to bring 147you tangible proof that my wanderings were not prompted from motives of selfishness or disdain. From my childhood I have listened in silence to the oft repeated regrets that our extraneous means of locomotion were limited to insects so lacking in the instincts of intelligence necessary for successful direction. Those available for locomotion were too ephemeral in their term of existence to be trusted for conveyance far beyond the habitable limits of our country, which from the illimitable firmament seemed to be but a mere speck upon the earth’s surface. With a curious desire to learn the wonders of creation overshadowed by the starry canopy, my earliest thoughts were directed to the acquirement of the means necessary for safe transportation above the earth’s surface. My thoughts were at first naturally directed to artificial wings as the indicated means of progressive transposition from earth to atmospheric space, without giving thought to the consideration of ponderable adaptability. Human mortality, which requires omnivorous support, declares itself ponderable in the vis inertia of earth, in contrast with the airy attenuations that bespeak adaptative intention in creating the tenants of space. In addition, with the successful achievement of working wings, there would be inevitable friction with the uncertainties of wear and derangement in flight, with awkward position of ponderable suspension in space for repairs. So my inventive genius was fain to hold itself convinced of the futility of subverting the order of elementary adaptation, designed by the Creator for the perfection of His intentions. Self convicted with the foolish audacity of my labors to safely suspend with motion, and locomote with facility ponderable humanity in space, I bethought myself of man’s privilege of making subordinate organic vitality, with legitimate kindly motive, subservient to his desired facilitations. For the elucidation of my thought suggestions I directed my investigations 148to insects of flight, to select from their varied species one suited to our requirements. The primary qualifications necessary were sagacity, supporting wing expanse, strength, longevity, and equal motion in flight, with instinctive perception of individuality sufficient for submission to our kindly direction. The efficient qualities indicated for the selection of a winged conveyance, were first, size, with an adaptation for control, in combination with a supporting buoyancy in excess of its individual requirements. In the second degree intelligence, with a longevity sufficient for compensative training, and memory capable of retaining the imposed impressions, subject to the recognition of personal direction foreign to their own volition. Added to these essential qualifications, it was desirable that the insect should be naturally inclined to sustain a long and swift flight. Bees had early attracted my attention, but there were many objections to their adoption that seemed insurmountable. Multitudinous in association, and individually aggressive, were primary defects in disposition; while in industrious habits and vocation they were subject to routine enactments, which together with the tenacious nature and method of collecting and disposing of their food threatened to end my ambitious projects, in trial with them, in death from suffocation, or waxed adhesion to their bodies or cells. The fear of being stalled and borne to their cells for living incorporation, raised an insuperable dread, that prevented me from coveting an experimental acquaintance with the working orders of their kind. Often in my wanderings I have passed beyond the boundaries of Manatitla in search of a locomotive desideratum, which I had supposed necessary for the welfare of our race, as well as a gratuitous vehicle for the gratification of my covetous desire to rise into the realms of space, to survey beneath our terrestrial place of abode. A month since I was returning homeward sad and dispirited 149with continued disappointments, when at the close of day, while the glowing tints of the setting sun still lingered in the glory of their parting adornment to foliage and flowers, I was attracted by the swift whirr of strange insect wings. In a moment my attention was drawn with intent desire toward a pair of insects bearing a hybrid resemblance to the bee family. After a careful reconnoitering inspection, seemingly directed, first, to the quality of the flowers of a tropical honeysuckle, and secondly, to see if they contained insect occupants, they alighted upon the petals of the fairest. Unlike the hoarding selfish instincts of their congeners of the bee kind, they premised their labors with playful dalliance, partly upon wing and with sprightly pedal evolutions, while darting in chase and counter chase in and out from the petaled cups of the flowers. In a few minutes their playful antics and fondlings ceased, then the male with an autocratic appearance of gallantry assisted his spouse to load herself with the sweets and waxy exudations of the flowers, this accomplished he sent her unescorted away, evidently to unload in their store house. During her absence he devoted his time to a general inspection of the flowers, with the evident intention of selecting the best. In one he found a belated droniva (a tropical representative of the bumble-bee family) who was ejected without ceremony, although double the size of the audacious usurper. His activity, independence, and cleanly regard for his own person, disposed me to excuse his cavalier exaction of service drudgery from his mate, as the duty seemed to afford her pleasure. In fact the pair impressed me so favorably, that I determined to avail myself of the opportunity to secure a permanent attachment.
<br> 
<br> “Years anterior, as you are aware, I perfected a harness in anticipation of the fulfillment of my hopes of being able to make a capture suited for our locomotive requirements. This I had carried with me in all 150my excursions, and while my coveted prize was engaged in his erratic flights, I placed myself in ambush in the fairest flower of his selection, and had the gratification of securing him in leash before the return of his mate. He soon became aware of unusual restraint, and curious to learn its cause made experimental flights which gave me an opportunity to test the success of my invention, and I was delighted to find that I could direct his course with ease. Seemingly puzzled at the loss of his voluntary power of direction, he made every available effort to learn the cause of his sudden bereavement, and was pursuing his investigations when his spouse returned. With mandibulations he quickly communicated to her the restraint that had been placed upon his movements during her absence. With evident anxiety she commenced a search for the impedimental cause. In a few moments she discovered the filamental guides that I had attached to his antenn? beneath the carapace, but failing in her attempts to remove them, after a short consultation, they rose in flight from the flower to the bee line of their home with a marked show of anxiety, which made me feel a glow of regret that my selfishness had been the cause of their disquietude. Once only, in homeward flight, did I attempt to subject him to a variation in course, but it caused such a trepidation in his mate that it was with difficulty that she recovered the balance movement of her wings. Reaching their cell, which was in a fissured ledge of basaltic formation, they held another consultation and investigation, during which my turret cone was subjected to a close examination, but the tough silicothed filaments were too strong for removal by her feeble efforts. Finding his strange investment inevitable, and attended with but slight inconvenience, he, at last, with cheerful philosophy, soothed the anxiety of his spouse with endearments, abated of their autocratic patronizing air of superiority. This 151show of appreciation for his mate’s solicitude, at once bespoke a high degree of sympathetic intelligence attained by a union of instinctive equality. In contrasted proof of the evident assumption, I will adduce the ants, and our neighbors of the human species, who live in a state of concubinage, to show that sexual gregation begets a condition of brutal selfishness in the males, causing them to use physical strength for the reduction of their females to serve as bond slaves of passion and labor for multitudinous production in kind. From their continued dalliance after nightfall, I was pleased to learn that their habits were semi-nocturnal in perceptive activity. When they finally retired for the night to the shelter within their cell, I suffered retributive spasms from the powerful mellific odors that pervaded the cell, which caused protracted coughing and general relaxation, so that in my extremity I was prompted to make my escape into the open air, but the intense darkness and my weakness prevented me. As my air passages became accustomed to the acrid irritation, I in sequence suffered from mellific narcotism, and fell into a stuporic medium between waking impressions and fantastic visions of instinct that precede the waking dawn from sleep. These variations continued until the bees’ emergence into the open air, in the morning, revived me. After their matutinal salutations they rose in flight circles to their bee line, but winged their course in an opposite direction from the honeysuckle plot so memorable in their previous day’s experience, probably attributing the cause of restraint to some inherent property of the flowers.
<br> 
<br> “My elevation and swift passage through the air, reminded me, with its bracing effect, that I had not taken food for a donsenack, so feeling at ease I unstrapped my script and made a hearty meal, with a zest that the words of our language will fail to express. Shortly after I had closed my morning meal, 152the bees commenced their circlings in downward descent, and ere long I discovered below, on the rocky declivity of a hillside a growth of honeysuckles, the goal of their attraction. In the circling support of their buzzing wings they remained suspended over the flowers for some time, until their safety had been tested by dronivas and humming-birds, then with caution they ventured to settle upon the petals, and after some hesitation, the female was loaded and dispatched with her first cargo to the cell. The male, as on the previous day, employed his time during her absence in an investigation of the floral resources of the hillside, with an occasional essay of his belligerent propensities directed against humming-birds and other collectors of sweets. This disposition, which seemed to have received an aggravated accession, in the vigorous temerity of daring assaults, from the restraints I had imposed, was treated with a gentle admonition to test their directing efficacy.
<br> 
<br> “The first essay provoked a display of resistance, but without avail in thwarting the changes I meditated, except for the production of a marked degree of discomfort, as the tension of the filamental bonds from opposing obstinacy caused a spasmodic action of the wings from axillary compression. Disconcerted, after frequent trials of his voluntary powers in opposition to my guiding mechanical appliances, he settled upon a petal for reflection. Then, seemingly, after mature consideration, an instinctive impulse would cause him to dart away in flight as if to test anew his strength in controlling volition, but only to be turned back before reaching the object of his destination. When successful, after frequent failures, he seemed to be quite as much disturbed as with the contrary results of his trials. I soon found in these practical essays, that my studied calculations for his direction fell far short of the absolute requirements of necessity and safety. In his short flights I discovered a power 153of resistance that baffled my attempts to direct his rise and descent, which was evidently independent of head and wings. Looking backward, when making a short tack, the resisting part was made manifest by the movements of the cartilaginous rings of the body. In studying the changing results in controlling direction, I found that the body acted as a rudder in flight for upward and downward inclination, and until I could obtain its concerted action with head and wings, instinctive volition would oppose my usurpation of its natural rights. With the view of effecting temporary control I rove a ring with a line attached to the four terminal quarters of its circumference, to act, when adjusted, as a tip to the body. This I confined in place without much difficulty, and passing the lines through corresponding guides to the carapace reflected them through pulleys back to the cone. These additions to my managing devices, met with no decided opposition, but the victim kept my movements under the watchful supervision of his eyes, but more in curiosity than in fear or anger. On the return of his mate, an antenn? inspection was improvised for tracing the new additions, but as their labors were quickly resumed, I interpreted their quiet resignation as an act of submission. After the departure of his spouse on her second homeward trip, he engaged in a flight trial to learn the extent of the new vetoes that I had placed upon his volition correspondence with members of his body corporate. His diminished lack of self-control begot a vengeful desire to retrieve compensation by inflicting retributive discomfort and stings upon the innocent. After his test trials had convinced him, that in movement he was no longer capable of commanding himself, but subject to a mysterious power, he fought two rounds with dronivas, the odds being four to one in favor of his opponents, each exceeding his weight by two thirds; after sustaining his pre?mption right to the sole occupation of the 154flowers with them, he matched his vengeful speed and tactics against a score of humming-birds, proving himself equal to his undertaking. Besides these emprises of valor and speed, I subjected him to a test of my guiding improvements to which he not only submitted in freedom from irritability, but seemed to recognize the new sensations and eccentric effects as a pleasing supplement to his involuntary powers, superseding in part the necessity of volition. Desiring that he might become accustomed to my guiding presence, and familiar with my person, I exposed myself as often as possible to his own and consort’s eyes, and on their return to the cell at nightfall, I felt certain that they had accepted me as an attached presage for good. As in oft repeated subjection to deleterious influences, the narcotic effluvia of the cell was far less offensive than on the previous night.
<br> 
<br> “With the dawn of the third morning the bees rose to their line and settled in descent upon the flowers in bloom on the vines subject to the previous day’s levy. As if in anticipation of my intention, the usual four cargoes were dispatched in less than an hour, then both circled upward to the line for homeward flight, when, to their astonishment, I turned the lead of the male to the westward. This deviation from ancestral custom, and sequent habits, aroused the most obstinate resistance, which after several pseudo starts succeeded in baffling my intention, and but for the fortunate discovery of the cause, which was the fouling of the sinister guiding line, I should have been obliged to succumb to the instinctive obstinacy transmitted for the preservation of formalistic routine. With hazardous determination I succeeded in righting it, notwithstanding the increased velocity of their homeward flight, accelerated by the instinctive impetus from the imparted zest of their return to the line of old habits. When again subject to my control, the course of the male was changed to a northwesterly 155direction, but the female coaxingly endeavored to turn him back with the voice of her wings, as she kept abreast in equal flight. Finding it impossible, she reluctantly resumed her station in the rear, yielding protestingly to his lead. At first a natural feeling deterred me from casting a look below through fear of being surprised with giddiness, but gradually this passed away under the exhilarating elasticity of the air, which appeared to raise my spirits to an equality with my ambitious aspirations. Presumptuous mortality even ventured to cast a scornful glance upon things mundane; when lo! in advance, rising to the bee line I discovered a meroptic bee-eater which dissolved in fear my exultations.
<br> 
<br> “Luckily my naturalistic studies enabled me to disappoint him of his premeditated tid-bit gratification, as I should have been included in his bill of fare, with a vale for the improved means of locomotion I had obtained for my people. Grateful for the presence of mind which in great emergencies baffles instinct, I abruptly changed the course of the bee northward. But the pursuing merop was not to be disappointed without an extra effort to secure his prize, for he immediately tried his chances in chase; but as he was soon distanced he gave up pursuit, still soaring above the trees to intercept those which he expected in train, but for once, at least, he was foiled in following the transmitted impressions of ancestral instinct. The curved flight of the merop, even with the advantage of superior swiftness, would have been quickly distanced by the undeviating line of the bees’ air trail when once in advance of their pursuer, unless retarded by the greed of an overload; of this fact the instinct of the bird is apprised, but hunger sets at variance all rules, and if he fails in intercepting, he often pursues. The apiaster, after his first capture, if his prize proves to be a honey bee, builds his nest beneath the line, for the purpose of surprising the 156homeward flight of the workers when loaded with his coveted sweets. My escape from sudden death, although easily avoided from seasonable discovery of the danger, served as a timely warning, which kept me in careful watch for unknown perils.
<br> 
<br> “Only a short space of time had elapsed from the start, when in advance I discovered a beautiful and highly cultivated valley. The giga laborers were Indians who were under white taskmasters. Passing over the valley, which extended to the northwest as far as the eye could reach, I changed our course to the northeast; rising to a line above the mountains two cities opened to my view, both inclosed with walls for protection. The largest city was built in the basin of an amphitheatre of surrounding hills, with an opening, and corresponding gate of the city, looking out upon the valley we had overflown. The second city was beautifully located upon the summit of a hill, overshadowed by the spray of a large waterfall that flowed over the brink of a precipice, which extended its barrier for miles north and south, its perpendicular descent being only broken by a zigzag roadway cut in its face for communication between the two cities. The wall of circumvallation around the City of the Falls was not fully completed, for thousands of workmen were still engaged upon the portion inclosing the large plain that sloped from the summit in broad expanse to the limits of the walled stream that flowed from the basin of the falls, without the foundation of the walls, to unite again without the cinctus gates. From the circling lash in the hands of the taskmasters, it was easy to comprehend that the laborers were bondsmen, their color indicating aboriginal birth.
<br> 
<br> “In homeward flight the bees were allowed to take their own course, which, from the accelerated rapidity in the motion of their wings, declared a nostalgic haste to enjoy the hospitalities of their sweet home. After 157the morning’s labor of the bees was completed on the succeeding day, I directed their flight over Manicul? to discover whether you were over anxious on my account, but as my family appeared to be free from disquiet I again turned my bees westward for new explorations. Alighting at midday on an island in a lake, south of the valley discoveries of the previous day, I found it unsettled with an animalculan race of tits, whose sole occupation seemed to be devoted to sociable potations of a fluid that excited amicable quarrels, in which the families engaged with wild enthusiasm, without respect to age or infirmities. The domestic amusements were varied with cockroach racings, worshiping, drinking, dancing, fighting, and hunting pediculas, in the latter sport the women and children engaged with peculiar zest. In verification of our sages demonstrations of instinctive cause and effect, when subject to gregarious association in folds, in freedom from the directing intelligence of Creative endowment, their bodies gave sure indication of reactive bestiality. Disgusted with the extremes they exhibited of wailings and vociferous jabberings, as the product of instinct bewrayed with madness, I was glad with grateful relief when my cleanly transport bore me again into the pure atmosphere beyond the sound reach of the reviling pretexts of these ape libels upon Creative intention. Assuming the privilege of a sub-lunary discoverer, I named the island Greenpat, from the emerald beauty of its tints, and the inhabitants Mouthpats, from their unthinking volubility, bespeaking the unkempt scragginess of their natures.
<br> 
<br> “Having tested the ready sagacity of my transport acquisition, and applicability for quick conveyance, I now propose to make use of it to obtain others of its kind, with a view to propagation, as I feel certain that it can be domesticated for mutual advantage, as both male and female evince an increasing confidence in 158the controlling influence of my presence; and of the enduring longevity of the species I feel equally certain.”
<br> 
<br> The assemblage, at the conclusion of the narration, enthusiastically congratulated Buzzee upon the result of his successful perseverance, saluting him as a public benefactor, with the title of apiamaster. In the course of a century there was not a family in Manatitla without a pair or more of the apis isolatas, which became known in common usage as the bee phaeton. Their introduction as locomotive facilitations contributed greatly to extended sociability, as they were able to bear with ease twenty giantescoes, forty mediums, or their equivalents in tits, and we have evident reason to believe that they instinctively enjoy their domestication with us better than in a wild state, for in our pleasure parties they harmonize the voice vibrations of their wings with our songs. To Buzzee’s inventive skill we are also indebted for the imperishable combination used in building, and the preparation of our textile fabrics.
<br> 
<br> After the discovery of the Heraclean cities, with the increase of our people’s means of communication, they were visited daily for the purpose of influencing the citizens to bestow more kindly treatment upon their aboriginal benefactors. Evoce (quick perception), a giantesco, had gained the ear of a cruel taskmaster, for the purpose of using his voice in expostulation, when to his surprise, he distinctly heard vengeful denunciations without the utterance of words of speech from the mouth of the brutal auramentee. Satisfied after frequent experimental repetitions that the enunciations were vocalized impressions heralding audited words of speech that could be suppressed or spoken, he made known the nature of his discovery to the Dosch and his advisers. The coincident impression of their own thought enunciations, confirmed Evoce’s suggestion that thought enunciation, and also 159instinctive mental impressions, were vocalized by an enunciator in proximity with the ear, and in communication with the combined organs of sense. Upon these suggestive conclusions was founded an experimental course of investigation, which resulted, not only in the full verification of their deductive anticipations, but with the development of the power of substituting extraneous impressions for adoption by the giga auramentee, through the modulated induction of the giantesco voice to an accord with the mood of the subject. Great care was required in the ventriloquial modulations of the auramentor’s voice for exact correspondence with the characteristic peculiarities of the auramentee’s; for any remarkable deviation was sure to alarm their superstitious fears. For the acquirement of facility in the substitution of ideas and thoughts, it was necessary to obtain humoristic ease in the detail expression of idiomatic phrase peculiar to the auramentee’s use of language. With the naturally good, we were soon able, with the mutual incitement of novelty, to evoke and cultivate the germ of pity, while with the instinctively bad our efforts served to arouse superstitious fears for the negative advancement of our object, through retributive apprehensions of vengeance in return for their cruelties. These, with strange inconsistency, caused sacrificial oblations, with deputized prayers, to be offered in commutation for the continued gratification of their evil habits and passions. Yet, with all the perversity of ruling instinct we have been able to accomplish much good through the means of thought substitution with your race.
