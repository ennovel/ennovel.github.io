At noon the train arrived having in charge Padre Simon as a special envoy from Captain Greenwood. His convoy brought letters from Europe and Montevideo in answer to those despatched by M. Hollydorf and Mr. Welson, also to the other members of the corps. The padre, although looking jaded with fatigue, was in his usual happy state of mental confusion, to which the affectionate greetings of the Heracleans and Kyronese greatly added, causing him to exclaim: “Well, I truly declare upon the soul of my conscience, I believe you are truly glad to see me!” His mental perplexity was increased by the nature of his mission, which will be gradually developed in progressive relation. Mr. Welson received a large budget of letters, many of which were from his correspondents in Panama, who were anxious to learn the cause of his long delayed return. Those relating to his business engagements were quickly despatched, his interest being more directly enlisted in the perusal of letters from his Montevidean and Buenos Ayrean correspondents. We will first offer the transcript of M. Baudois’s letter.
<br> Buenos Ayres, November 19, 182-.
<br> To Se?or Don Guillermo Welson:
<br> Heraclea of the Falls, Andean La Plata.
<br> 
<br> My Dear Sir,—Your letter was duly received, and I can truly say that its contents taxed my credulity 254to its utmost stretch. The discovery of remnant Latin and Asiatic races was quite sufficient for the rational digestion of wondering admiration! But the revelation of Animalculan representatives of humanity quite staggered and mazed my powers of marvelous conception, until reason had with cool reflection weighed your written evidences of sanity. Then, quite convinced that you did not design to test the extent of my gullibility with the conjurations of your imagination, I found within myself evidences of sustaining approval that confirmed my believing reliance in the sincerity of your imparted happiness. If the extinct Giga animal species are represented by living Animalculan, it appears quite reasonable that the order of continuation should embrace the human. With these deductive considerations my reason became reconciled for the recognition of your Manatitlans as real negotiable representatives of humanity. Again my wondering admiration expanded from your description of their habits and educated power of self control for the exampled reciprocation of good will. It is but natural to conceive that affectionate confidence must result from self government, for purity and goodness are the parents of unselfishness. In comparative degree we have seen that the children of our race, who from necessity have been trained for the exercise of self denial, are reliable and affectionate in contributing to the associate happiness of others. It is impossible for me to find adequate words suited for the expression of the relief afforded from the light that dawned upon my perception through the vista opened for the realization of Creative intention! Dull, indeed, must be the faculties of a person unable to realize, upon the moment, the certain effect that would result from cultivating the germ of goodness for the control of instinctive animality. In deference to the Manatitlans’ loving perspicacity, which has enabled them almost innately to discover the impression of 255design in cultivating from infancy the germ of goodness, my body seemed to shrink with shame from its distended growth of fungus, emblematical of stupidity, under the influence of their imparted intelligence. But with a knowledge of cause my efforts for relief were attended with an instinctive oppression from animality, so apparent in its selfishness, that with my utmost effort I could only obtain partial relief, with the resolve of affording, at most, an imperfect example for the benefit of future generations. Under the presaged reality of the Heracleans’ affectionate and enduring sympathy, my hereditary infidelity, begot from the adverse fatuity of sectarian delusions, faded like the Pampa mists before the brightness and genial warmth of the morning sun. Now that the Manatitlan system of education has revived my hopes, I look forward with trustful desire that my life may be prolonged to witness the full inauguration of self-legislation, for time and eternity, in freedom from the proxied impositions of instinctive priestcraft, and politic statesmen.
<br> 
<br> With regard to the search you wished to have me make for relic information: I have succeeded in unearthing collateral evidence which proves beyond a doubt that many galleys from the interior waters of the eastern continent, connecting through the Mediterranean Sea with the Atlantic Ocean, reached the shores of the La Plata estuary before the advent of our Christian era. At different dates during the last two centuries rumors have been rife attesting to the existence of a walled city inhabited by a white race, situated in an Andean valley that gives rise to the river Vermejo, or its tributary source. The reports, at different periods, caused the Jesuits to make several attempts to negotiate a favorable disposition on the part of the Indians to impart knowledge in verification; but all their overtures were treated with an evasive skill that involved the question of its real 256existence in greater mystery. Their missionary attempts to penetrate the country of the wild hordes, beyond the river chacas, were opposed with determined and successful hostility. The community of Pompolio has been an acknowledged fact for centuries. The ancestors of your Kyronese were the reputed founders of Mendoza, from which they were driven by the mongrel progenitors of the present inhabitants.
<br> 
<br> The remains of vessels of undoubted Ph?nician, Egyptian, and Roman construction have been found imbedded in the preserving guanic and alluvial deposits that have filled with their accumulations the inlets where they were moored. Of these Don Pedro Garcia will give you a succinct written account. The following notice of a relict discovery I have copied in translation from an old number of the “Gazette de Bogota”:—
<br> 
<br> “Voice le passage tel qui le donnent les Nouvelles Annals des Voyages, 1st Tome, page 393, anne 1832. Au village de Dolores deux lieus de Montevideo un plantuer decouvrier une pierre tumuliare des caracteres inconuus. Relevant cette pierre il trouve un caceau de briques renfermant, deux sabres antique bronze, un casque, et un boucler, tres amphor? par le huile, et une in terre de grand dimensions.

Fait il conclure de cette decouverte de contemporaire 257de Aristotle a fouile de du sol Bresil. Est il probable que Ptolemie ce clef bein conu de la plotte de Alexandre entraine par un tempte an milieu dece las enciens appelaient les grand mur ait ete jette les cotes du La Plata et y ait marque son passage pax ce memorial monument fait dans trois les ces fort curieux les archeoloques.”—Gazette Universelle de Bogota.
<br> 
<br> At the period this relic discovery indicates, the proximate swiftness of the current stream setting to and from the Strait of Gibraltar to the La Plata estuary can be estimated by present calculation, which has been rated at twenty miles an hour during the height of a monsoon gale. This would give a surface speed to a floating object of four or five miles an hour, under direct impetus; and with a due allowance for counter slips from eddies, lack of direction, and other causes, a chance voyage might be accomplished in from twenty to thirty days. With the square sails used in Ptolomic vessels, with shallow prows made to imitate the breasts and necks of water fowls, a swift passage could have been made with intention and a favoring wind; but it was the superstitious custom of the ancient mariners to rely upon the direction of fate. M. Hollydorf or Dr. Baāhar could arrive at a proximate conjecture of the derivative source of the Kyronese from the Syriac root and terminals, and by like tests, if of Beberi or Morisco extraction. The fourth wonder of your Arabian Knights’ discoveries is the fact that a savage of the wild hordes can be favorably influenced by exampled goodness, or in any way hold himself amenable to either reason or kindness. Yet I would urge the necessity of impressing them with a knowledge of good and evil, with a detective perception sufficient for your protection against their revengeful instincts, that you may not become the victims of misplaced confidence for the malicious injuries inflicted by our race.
<br> 
<br> In closing my epistle I will truthfully declare that 258I envy the meanest capacity of your party his privilege of contributing to your common fund of enjoyment. How I have longed, waited, and despaired, for the irresistible charm of affectionate sincerity, that betokens in its reach immortality. A note from Don Pedro advised me of his family’s desire that I would visit them as a consulting aid in your behalf. You are but too well aware of his past source of disquietude. Greatly to my relief I found him with his two daughters, your little favorites, Lovieta and Lavoca, filled to overflowing with an affectionate appreciation of the manifold resources of your discovery. As our meeting, under the circumstances, was characteristic, I will endeavor to render the mutual impressions of the scene in enactment. In the place of the Teutonic custodian, with the forbidding Cyclopean visage, Don Pedro received me at the open puerta, evidently in waiting expectation of my arrival. Confronting each other at the entrance we stood for a second regarding each the other with the mutual reflection of wistful eyes, until the rising flush of our united emotions bespoke like impressions; then with an impulsive disregard for formalistic dignity, and greatly to the surprise of watchful neighbors, we embraced with the allied warmth of our new role of sympathy. Shrinking from the curious gaze of strangers we entered, Don Pedro surrendering his post to the portress who received from me, for the first time, a courteous greeting, which was returned in kind. In the patio we were met by Lovieta and Lavoca who, with the quick interpretation of infantile affection, discovered the prompted source of our unusual cordiality. Receiving permission from their father they at once commenced to unravel the tale of Don Guillermo’s wonderful discoveries, with frequent halting questions for elucidation, and commentaries upon the startling information imparted from your letter to them, which was premised with the confidential acknowledgement: 259“Why, M. Baudois, it’s queer we love you so much this morning, and were so afraid of you before, which kept us from liking you!” Then for an hour or more they prattled of affection with such a clear perception of the Manatitlan rendering, that I felt acutely the poverty of my own resources. In testimony of affection’s inexhaustible attractions, I remained with them three days before the prime object of the visit engaged our attention, and then, with reluctance, we turned our vision back to trace with our material guide-posts the progenitorial evidences of Heraclean advent.
<br> 
<br> You urge me to visit Heraclea. I can assure you that there is not in the wide range of thought a prospect that would afford me a tithe of the pleasure; but I am ashamed to acknowledge that I feel within me the old leaven of instinctive dislike for the members of the corps, from nationality. For personally, as you are aware, I have no acquaintance with them. From this cause I am so doubtful of self control within that I cannot with sincerity venture the experiment of voluntary association with them, even under Heraclean auspices. My feelings, as a Frenchman, are still instinctively patriotic, notwithstanding the reproof administered in every sentence of your letter. I am well aware of all you would urge in favor of the trial, and my reason sanctions with desire all you could say; and it is with humiliation that I am candidly obliged to avow myself unfit for an association with the German members of the corps, although they have received the prestige of Heraclean adoption. If my disposition would allow me to enact the part of affectionate sympathy, the treacherous disguise of hypocrisy would not shield me from Manatitlan auramentation, with whom I would fain hold myself, in sincerity, worthy, to the extent of my freedom from instinctive disability. However much you may regret my lack of the noble qualities, which 260allow your unbiased passions the privilege of repose, I am certain that your native Gallic infusion of clannish prejudice, will, even with your new light, appreciate the honesty of my motives. To merit the esteem of the Manatitlans, I will use every possible means for the subjugation of my sectional prejudices; having already been obliged to acknowledge to myself, from the revolting impression still retained of the commune massacres of Paris, that with the murderous spirit in train, we should scarcely have shown as merciful a record as the Germans, if we had been victorious. With better generals as players, in the deadly game of war, the weak movements of our imbeciles were forestalled and checkmated. This causes a furious undercurrent for reprisal, especially as the war was precipitated by a tyrant without the provisionary tact to foresee and provide for the tottering destiny of his throne. Of course, the disastrous results of war reflect from the ruler to the subjects, alike in imbecility and determined intelligence. Our soldiers were driven like sheep to the slaughter. In fact, there was no real cause for the war on either side, and great reason why it should have been firmly opposed on the part of the French people, who have in the game enacted the part of pawns and are paying the penalty. The victorious can afford the dole of generosity to the defeated. This retrospective glance I offer as a specimen of my instinctive forbearance, and until I feel the sincerity of my self-control, I must avoid temptation likely to arouse hatred and revenge, the chief constituents of patriotism. With sincere gratitude for the happiness I have enjoyed from your intuition, you can rest assured of its strong impression in reciprocation.
<br> H. Baudois.
<br> 
<br> N. B. Since the above conclusion of my letter, I have visited and opened a tumulus raised over the remains of a Roman woman. The inscription engraved 261upon a stone covered by the mound, had been rendered nearly illegible from detrition, but we were enabled to decipher, with an approach to certainty, the following detached words: Cor. * * * *, * * * Augusta * *. Ib uxor * * * * * * *. Allissuis. * * *. The distaff was an emblem used for the commemoration of industrious habits when graved in an upright position, but when trailed from a spun thread, it indicated a gad-about reputation. Don Pedro will write you a particular description of our joint labors. I will now stay my still overburdened pen, to give my thoughts maturity for better expression. H. B.
<br> 
<br> As Mr. Welson read M. Baudois’s letter aloud with a slow, clear, and distinct accentuation, it was intelligible to all, and elicited warm encomiums, with a strong desire to listen to the reading of Don Pedro Garcia’s, which we transcribe.
<br> Buenos Ayres.
<br> 
<br> Querido Don Guillermo,—Since we received your letters describing your marvelous adventures (which we believed, because we could not doubt the truthful sincerity of your affection), we have been in a constant flutter of joyous exhilaration, which has served to clear the murky atmosphere of our household from its time-honored odors and rites of instinctive religion. While bestirring ourselves for the relief of our bodies with the labors of purification for domestic entertainment, we (M. Baudois is now a member of our family) have employed our thoughts in trying to anticipate the effect of your revelation in stemming the tide of ritual selfishness. Also in measuring the extent of opposition and consternation it will cause among the ceremonial adherents of sects congregating for the worship of self-preservation while preying upon each other. We have already felt a foreboding of its practical effect, in demonstration, 262from our family incubus, Padre Molinero. By depriving sects of their material heaven and hell,—upon which in positive and negative entrance fee priestcraft has issued policies of insurance for the soul of instinct from time out of date,—you will lay an eternal embargo upon their selfish schemes of praying premiums. Indeed, in sanguine forecast we can now see the gasping flutterings of saving grace in its last ritualistic struggles for salvation from inevitable oblivion, giving place to the glorious effulgence of an affectionate immortality. As you can well imagine, I have but little to say in extenuation for my past infatuation, other than that my reason and reverence halted with the dullness of indifference, causing me to accept forms, from the fact that my veneration could find no hopeful resting place. We can now scarcely endure the reflection, that through life we have remained so dull of apprehension, as not to have discovered from self-intuition, that purity and goodness could alone fulfill the indications of Creative intention for the assurance, in life, of an affectionate immortality. From the moment I read your letter I became subject to an awakening translation from self, and in relief from the dread incubus, become overjoyed with the prospect of affording aid to others. That you may more fully realize the effect of the transition, it was quickly discovered by the watchful expectancy of your chiquita favorites Lovieta and Lavoca, who were waiting for the confections of love they knew you would not fail to send for their affectionate regalement. When the rays of gladness began to dawn in my face, they interrupted my reading by nestling their arms about my neck, while they whispered, as if fearful of disturbing the joyful emotions, “O father, how happy you look, there must be something good for us,—do let us kiss you and then read it for we long to hear what Querido Don Guillermo has written to make you look 263so alegre.” With this appeal, seconded by an affectionate assault, I commenced from the beginning of your letter,—but half unfolded to my own view,—and as I read explained to their wondering comprehension the marvelous transitions of your experience. With the introduction of Correliana my reading became interjectional from the staccato inflection of kisses telegraphed to her goodness, with the exclamations, “How beautiful,” “Marvilloso!” “Oh, if”—but the wish remained unfinished in voiceful expression, yet the conscious flush of momentary sadness plainly interpreted the burden of their thoughts in hopeful appeal. These emotions, advocated in truthful sincerity the sway of goodness, during the infantile period, if unprejudiced by deleterious example,—when my unfortunates have retained its impression so perfectly, notwithstanding their exposure to its adverse influence. With the ready perception of such youthful neophytes the Manatitlans’ demonstration of exampled direction in purity and goodness must succeed with our race. For older appreciation, how could its truthful impression be more clearly defined for the comprehension of common sense, or more agreeable to loving veneration directed to the Supreme Source of all good, than through the attractive avenue of infantile perception? Practical, or exampled purity and goodness in attainment, are in substance, to my understanding, the length and breadth of Manatitlan “theology,” if I may be permitted to use a word so devoid of intrinsic meaning, for the expression of the highest possible conceptions of realized achievement. I feel certain that I have not misconstrued the Manatitlan “Code” from the enthusiastic approval of the above named theologists known to your loving sympathy.
<br> 
<br> How the sectaries will dispose of the Manatitlan method of perfecting their children in loving affection cannot be solved by anticipation. But my 264household has been “blessed” with a partial solution of the Catholic method that will be adopted, by a demonstrative denunciation of you and your Manatitlan exemplars as infernal innovators, by your old “friend” Padre Molinero. Forgetting in his wrathful displeasure that anathemas were vicarious oaths in fiendish transposition for priestly cursing, he dispensed them freely for the final disposal of all innovators, and in personal designation included those that I hold most dear in my affectionate esteem. With a self-control, that made me feel for a moment exultant, in view of my former frailties of temper, I coolly reminded him of the formulistic rites established by society for association; assuring him that I should sustain the sanctuary privileges, and stable rights of my roof, recognized by civilized humanity, against the intrusion of any and all persons refusing to hold themselves amenable to the unobtrusive rules of instinctive propriety. This admonition so enraged him, that his malignant intolerance burst forth in demoniacal ebullition, heedless of my direct hints that he was overstepping the limits of patient endurance. But as he continued to inveigh, I with authority withheld his further speech, with a determination that overawed him, and then, while directing his way to the outer gates, stated in plain terms my desire to hear him express a determination to absent himself from my house henceforth and forever. This final ultimatum, after years of undisputed sway, caused his former expression of vengeful hate to appear, in comparison, like the mild gleams of summer electricity, in contrast with the fierce flashes uttered with the deep mutterings of the full charged thunder cloud. Indeed, when the portera discharged him with her absolution, his visage became visibly expanded with a toadish expression of ire, and his throat with a sack constriction resembling the cobra’s when about to strike for venomed injection. Failing in speech to 265intimidate, he had recourse to the fierce ritually crossings of excommunication, which formerly caused kings and emperors to tremble with instinctive fear. This impotent effort must have summoned to my face a contemptuous expression, for Teudschen, the portera, made a significant gesture of questioning inquiry with her foot, as he passed over the threshold, which I negatived with a decisive shake of the head, else, I should now have to bear the stigma of sanctioning an act of celerity she was desirous of communicating to Padre Molinero to expedite his exit. Instead of denying her impulsive intention of rendering pedal acceleration to the padre’s outward movement, when I reproved her for the meditated unfeminine act, which in consummation would have given rise to great scandal, she innocently asked, “what else could a woman do when there was no broom handy?” Then she continued, in extenuation, “If men come into the houses of good peoples, dressed like women in petticoats, and don’t behave properly, as they ought, it’s right that they should be served by a woman as a man would treat them if he dared!” This Hibernic style of pleading, with its touch upon the mild nature and lack of decision in my exercise of authority, at once dispelled my ill humor; and I questioned her, whether as a good Lutheran she was familiar with the text that taught the returns that were to be made for despiteful treatment? After a little thoughtful hesitation, she said, “I don’t exactly remember, but I believe they were kicked out of the house.” This answer closed my catechismal interview, but however remote its orthodoxy was from the inculcation of the text, its validity was loyal in the sound doctrinal expression of instinct. For the humorous method of Teudschen’s style of speaking, with the broken wabbling tones of her voice, in variation from Low Dutch guttural to the harsh grating rasp of High German, I will refer you to your memory of the gratification 266you derived from conversing with her. Leaving the patio with my feelings of anger unruffled by Teudschen’s patriotic simplicity, which had long been aggravated by Padre Molinero’s French sympathies, I returned falteringly to the salon, fearing that the mother of my children might view the expulsion of her confessor as an unpardonable sin; still I could not help congratulating myself upon the manner in which I had rid my household of the traitorous fomenter of misrule and family discord. Entering her apartment fully prepared to meet her scornful and defiant glances, ill masked under the disguise of indifference, I was startled out of my assumed composure by the unexpected greeting of tearful eyes, and soft pleading glances bespeaking self-deprecation. These premonitions of repentant affection brought back, with the loving glow of gladness, the happy impressions of our early wedded life when I was all sufficient as a confessor without the aid of priest or mother-in-law. Determined to make good the step I had taken for freeing my family from the prying curiosity and dictation of droning priests, I met her advances with affectionate warmth; but after listening to her expressions of revived sympathy, I with conscious power, never before realized, asked her if she was willing to seek another priestly adviser; if she still considered it necessary to bar her husband from his affectionate privilege? Feeling a sympathetic tremor in full assent with my wishes, as she silently embraced me, I expressed, with endearments, the hope that I had proved myself worthy of her love and confidence, except from occasional displays of temper provoked by the influence that had caused her estrangement. An answering sob, with its regretful pressure, confirming the favorable advantage of the moment, I questioned whether her unbiased perception had ever discovered in me a willful deficiency, or one of indifference, that I could correct for 267enhancing her present happiness, or advancing her preparation for a future state. If I had been so unfortunate or neglectful in my intention, with her affectionate reciprocation, I would make it my constant text for amendment. In vain she tried to give expression in words to the welling revival of loving emotions, but, although in voiceful effort she failed, her lips with truthful impression absolved me. Blinded with repentant tears she indicated her desire to be left alone; obedient to the unexpressed wish I left her.
<br> 
<br> Lovieta and Lavoca, who had witnessed the scene of happy reconciliation, sat with arms entwined about each other’s necks, mingling their tears in grateful sympathy, otherwise holding themselves aloof with wonderful discretion, as if with the understanding that their participation would divert the full measure of love’s revived reciprocation. But as the door closed upon their mother, I felt their hands caressingly raise mine to their lips, while in relieved vent of consolation and childish dislike, they exclaimed in sobbing accents, first Lovieta, “The—the—ugly—o—old zopilote!” [carrion vulture] to which Lavoca appended, “Who—who—comes—to—to—our—house,—when—he—he—knows—we—we—ain’t dead.”
<br> 
<br> Upon you, my dear Don Guillermo, rests this irreverent title, and knowledge of vocation in application, and as you see the retentive rendering my children have made of it, I hope that you will not sin away the day of grace offered for repentance! If you, a stranger, found yourself unable to resist the pleadings of their affectionate natures, you can judge of a fond father’s partiality, and will excuse his frequent introduction of their quaint comparisons, especially as they are largely indebted to you for their capital ideas? They have proved the choicest of our blessings, and in love’s arbitrations have ever been the pure mediums 268of affectionate reunion. After a sufficient season had been allowed from my anxious desire, the children were sent to add their weight to the favoring balance of their mother’s affection. Quickly returning, with guarded steps prompted for affectionate surprise, they approached silently,—as I sat with bowed head, hopefully musing, with the desire that Consolata might be changed into unwavering semblance of your Heraclean matrons,—and the velvety wreath of their arms again encircled my neck, while Lovieta and Lavoca’s Manatitlan voices whispered, in joyous emulation, “Go to mamma!” Dear Don Guillermo, you will rejoice to know that she met me at the door with a fond embrace, and the sobbing supplication, “Pedro, can you forgive me? If you can, and will let me love you again, your desires shall ever be mine!” The coveted appeal required no repetition, for there was in her words an expression of anguished regret, that surprised conviction with the assurance of our mutual amendment. You will, I am sure, forgive me for obtruding my uxorious prolixity, in giving vent to the expression of our united happiness, a boon long coveted without the hopeful expectation of realization. Consolata (I trust that I shall never again have occasion to revive the old name of Malaspina, as a household term of endearment addressed to my wife, once so painfully familiar to your ears), rejoices that your forced adventure has terminated so happily, for she insists that her willful vagaries caused you to accept Captain Greenwood’s invitation. In delegating our representative pen to ask your forgiveness for the discomfort she caused, she promises an amendment that shall be addressed in requital to the comfort of others. Should you return, you will be surprised with the change wrought in the appearance of our household, even with the advantage this will afford you for anticipation. Could you but note the placid enjoyment of Lovieta and Lavoca, imparted 269from the blending and calm repose of parental example, your present joys would be greatly enhanced. Even Teudschen, in the wondering admiration of her phlegmatic stolidity, clasps her hands with surprised inertia, while subject to the active direction of Consolata in the busy avocations that ever delight the tidy housekeeper. In truth, there is a strange mystery, which puzzles us in accounting for her inventive resources, and their apt adaptability for the conservation of purity and comfort. In the style of her own and childrens’ dresses, which in apparent devisement originated within herself, we discover prompted aid, as well as in the selection and preparation of material. But for comfort, cleanliness, and beauty of adaptation, they are a constant source of congratulatory admiration, although outrê in regard to the prevailing fashions; but as they bear a strong resemblance to the Heraclean costumes, description would prove gratuitous. If this great change in Consolata has been wrought through the reproving self conviction of the unlovely contrast she presented to the description you gave of Correliana Adinope, I can almost feel grateful that her ill temper, under the sway of her confessor, was carried to the extremity of forcing upon itself a remedy that has proved so salutary in effect; and the fear of a relapse, which was at first entertained, is gradually passing away. M. Baudois, without hesitation, suggests Manatitlan influence. If it is possible that they have vouchsafed us direction, as guides and instructors in our extremity, they are certainly aware of our grateful emotions. Impressed with this belief, without fully understanding the process by which auramental thought-substitution is effected, Lovieta and Lavoca, when subject to transient scintillations of temper, will firmly close their mouths to guard against the utterance of words prompted by anger. The change in M. Baudois presents many features equally remarkable with those 270of Consolata. You will recollect that he excelled as a pianist, but of that class whose talent resides in the mechanical use of the fingers and eyes in execution; now he holds you enrapt with the pathos of harmonized sympathy. He often exclaims that his seemingly impromptu compositions are a marvel to himself. Has it not amazed you greatly, from the ready realization of immortal impressions through the avenue of unselfish goodness, that humanity has continued heedless through the lapse of so many ages, blinded with will o’wisp infatuations? Although still full to overflowing with grateful reciprocations of happy experience, we will forego their written expression for the present, to give place for the description of our discoveries of relict mementoes brought by the ocean currents and wind wafts from the Eastern continent, decades of centuries ago. They will certainly afford Mr. Dow material aid upon which to found his conjectural history.
<br> 
<br> While dredging the Laguna Fecal in the year 1852, for ammoniacal guano in its crystalized and mixed combinations, the sieve grapnel brought to the surface several pieces of fashioned wood of remarkable appearance. From their shape and peculiar method of union, the curiosity of the laborers became excited; and as my devotion to antiquarian research was known to the Padrone, a message was sent to me expressing the desire that I would attend personally and direct the labors of the workmen in accordance with my judgment. Before my arrival, an anchor of hard copper alloy was raised. After carefully removing the ammoniacal incrustations, a clear impress of its form was found stamped on the shank beneath the ring. This indenture was the maritime seal of the early Ph?nician cities. Knowing the high scientific value that I placed upon the relict vestiges of past ages, the Padrone and workmen voluntarily surrendered all that had been recovered.
<br> 
<br> 271After carefully sounding to obtain a knowledge of the imbedded extent of the detached portions, and to learn the dimensions of the vessel, if its planks and timbers were yet retained in position by their fastenings, it was inclosed in a coffer-dam, and the retained guanic admixture with water was pumped out for evaporation. When cleared, the trove, with the aid of dredge and shovels, was in a few days fully exposed to view. As we had anticipated, the prize proved to be the remains of an ancient galley. Calculating from the keel, which remained nearly entire, the extreme length from its heel to the stem of the prow must have exceeded, free from overworks, seventy feet. The keel was stepped for prow, main, and stern masts. The former and latter were respectively placed within a few feet of the extreme ends of the keelson, or its semblance, which strengthened the true step in the keel. The septum support of the main-mast united the after and forward decks, separating the banks of oarsmen, with ample space between for passage fore and aft. Beneath the lower bank-pits a portion of the deck remained, showing the foot-wear of the rowers in their forward and backward steps of reach. The hold beneath was of sufficient capacity for the storage of provisions for a long voyage. The run-planking on the starboard side was sufficiently well preserved to show the columbares for a single bank of eight oars, as well as those in the stern designed for the rudder blades. The fact of there being only a single bank of oars in the true planking, afforded presumptive evidence of commercial intention, as in a vessel so large their propelling power would have proved insufficient for ordinary progression, but as adjuvantic aids to the sails, in light winds, they would prove valuable. The seams between the planks still retained the papyrus with which they had been caulked; this had been introduced with pitch or melted resin; the combined effects 272of age and ammonia had changed the paying substance, so that in appearance it resembled amber. The remains of the galley presented for the study of the antiquarian a double interest, historical and mechanical, the latter, with its material indications of skill in art adaptation, affording a clue to the periodic stages of progression as the head and hand mark of coeval intelligence. The wood used in its construction was the red, aromatic cedar of Lebanon, which gave indications of large growth, many of the planks reaching the entire length of the hull, perhaps determining at the time the size of the vessel. During the early ascendancy of Roman rule, the Appenine pine, or fir, was brought into requisition for ship building; but the cedar of Lebanon still retained its reputation founded upon intrinsic value, as it exceeded all other woods in elastic toughness, lightness, durability, and unattractive freedom from parasitic accumulations peculiar to the Mediterranean and ocean. The rostrum or beak had been detached from the prow and set upon an altar aft, among other memorial lares. In form it blended the graceful curve of the swan’s neck with the repulsive rug? of the serpent’s expansive skin, characteristically sustained with the mythical “figure-head” of a dragon. In addition to the holes mortised in the true keel for the reception of the ribs, they were secured in place and rendered steadfast by a clamp attachment to an overlaying substitute for the modern keelson, to which they were firmly bolted, with a workmanlike precision that had defied the lapse of time, and decomposing agency of salts and exposure, a chance portion only of the metal being exposed. But to the lost art of hardening copper with a non-erosive alloy, its preservation was chiefly to be attributed. The larboard portion of the prow’s planking still retained the eye, consecrated as the watchful guardian of course and detector of danger.
<br> 
<br> When the hull was raised from its long repose in 273the bed of the lagoon, which had formerly been an inlet of the La Plata, and thoroughly dried, it was restored, in a measure, to its former lightness, from which it was easy to conceive its swift progress over the waters when impelled by oars or a favoring gale, as it but slightly taxed the strength of twenty men to bear it upon their shoulders to its present resting place, in the outer patio of my museum built for its reception.
<br> 
<br> Your description of the Kyronese lineaments favors a descent from the primal union of the Ph?nician with the North African races. I have relics exhumed remote from the shores of the La Plata, of undoubted Morisco fabrication, some of which bear a date corresponding with the second century of our era. From these material evidences, we have conclusive proof that the currents evoked from the disgorgements of the Mediterranean’s tidal surplus, through the Strait of Gibraltar, and the large river-drains of South America, by the La Plata estuary, in monsoon reciprocation, have proved the accidental highway of tempest-sped vessels, from the period when they were first built with a carrying capacity sufficient for the transportation of merchandise, and the free navigation of the inland seas with sails. The diversity of color, facial contour, and structural art of fabrication, plainly bespeak an intermixture of European, Asiatic, and African races with the aborigines of America. That the supply was accidental, and limited to the recurrence of causes happening after the lapse of long intervals, is apparent from the numerous depopulated cities, whose inhabitants, like those of old Heraclea, presumed upon their ritual intelligence to enslave the natives and barbarously treat them, until the arrogance of folly and over-indulgence opened a way for retributive judgment in total annihilation. Hence the mottled appearance of the natives in the neighborhood of the ruined cities of Mexico and Yucatan, 274derived from a relapse after a sparse inoculation of the lighter shades of color. The same effects are apparent in all the coast eddies confluent with the inter-oceanic currents from the disemboguement of large rivers, as in the fruitful valleys of their interior tributaries, ruins indicating exotic races are generally found.
<br> 
<br> As all these conjectural evolutions of deductive thought, relative to the transition events of the past, are unprofitable, in comparison with the cultivation of the conscious elements of goodness, for the prospective happiness of future generations, through the avenue of educated self-legislation, you must excuse the little attention that I have devoted to research for the elucidation of Heraclean derivation.
<br> 
<br> Our desire to see you, under the impressions imparted from Heraclean example, has increased with our happiness, until it has become almost irresistible. Strange as it may appear to you, Consolata consulted me this morning upon the feasibility of making a trip to Heraclea. The idea was an infinite source of pleasure to us all, M. Baudois alone expressing regretful sorrow that there was a prejudiced obstacle in the way over which he held doubtful control, and until he had reduced it to kindly subjugation he would not adventure himself as the possible cause of a lack of freedom to the genial flow of sincerity. The nature of this “lion,” still at large, barring his way to Heraclean enjoyment, we can surmise, but we think from the present cordial relations existing between him and Teudschen that it would prove a whimsical prejudice rather than a reality. Lovieta and Lavoca have set their little heads together in council, with our consent and approval, to solicit your aid and intercession for their admission into the Heraclean school. Notwithstanding our children are to us the solacing light and warmth of affection in personification, we wish to advance their happiness, for transmission, upon a sure 275basis, even if we shall be obliged to defer our own visit for a season; for we have full faith in their increasing love, and shall find ample consolation for our temporary bereavement in the prospect of a joyful reunion. In the meantime,—if our petition should prove agreeable to the pr?tor and tribunes,—while waiting for Captain Greenwood, the children specially desire that you will extend to the Manatitlan volantaphs an invitation for them to make our house their abiding place whenever they visit Buenos Ayres. M. Baudois is now engaged in devising means for their accommodation on our roof, having already completed the architectural designs for the falcon mews, and colemena for the phaeton bees. As yet his invention halts in calculating the furnishing requirements suited in capacity for the size of our anticipated guests. Lovieta and Lavoca jointly solicit one or more of the Manatitlan donecellita giantescoes to act as auramental governantes in preparation for their entrance into the Heraclean school, if the Dosch approves and will favor them with a suspension of their school regulations. “If the request is granted, they promise to attend personally to their comfort, and will try to prove obedient to their direction in everything.” Consolata hopes that your present powers of self-control will enable you to banish from your memory the remembrance of her unworthiness, promising, with the opportunity, to give full expression to the sincerity of her supplication with practical evidences of her amendment. Our endeavors to impress “our little folks” with the relative size of the Manatitlan giantescoes, mediums, and tits, has been but partially successful, from our own deficiency of subject comprehension. At present they seize upon representative minuti?, in suggestive similitude, for mental comparison. For the material illustration of head capacity, pins of different sizes have been brought into requisition, and for the eyes those of needles; still there is a 276lingering vagueness in all of our conceptions of Manatitlan proportions in bodily endowment.
<br> 
<br> If consistent with Manatitlan propriety, in the economy of time, it would afford us great satisfaction if they would permit us to entertain a sufficient number of their people to keep us well directed, for we have become vividly conscious of our instinctive frailties. In anticipation of a favorable answer to our joint requests I have had a flag-staff raised upon our roof surmounted with the letters P. G. In closing we wish to inquire if, as with us, in our household association, you, in your intercourse with the Heracleans are disinclined to speak unless you have something useful, solacing, or mirthful to say? We have certainly grown chary in speech, but with a flowing increase in the current of loving communication, with the prospect of reducing language to a nearer approximation to the truthful intention of its manifest devisement. With gratitude for the inexpressible happiness you have been the means of conferring, we shall ever esteem it a favor if you will permit us to supply your material wants, foreign to the resources of Heraclea.
<br> Pedro Garcia,
<br> for household adherents.
<br> 
<br> P. S. Will it surprise you to learn that Pedro Garcia, whose vanity delighted in being esteemed learned in past usages under the patronizing titles conferred by the garnered wisdom of colleges and societies, and M. Baudois, the corresponding savan of the French Academy, have consigned to the elementary combustion of fire all their theoretical works? On the 27th prox. the uniformly bound works of my library, expatiating upon the theory and practice of theology, medicine, and law, in company with those of M. Baudois treating on glacial and other theories of the earth’s transitions and destiny, were carted to my quinta and consigned to the flames. P. G.
