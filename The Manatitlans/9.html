Food and clothes for raiment were bestowed in hampers and bales, by the Kyronese, in quantity sufficient for the easy carriage of the mules; while Captain Dow and his subalterns, Jack and Bill, marshaled the Kyronese guard in preparation for rifle, pistol, and howitzer, defensive and offensive practice. At sunrise, when nearly ready for the start, Correliana clapped her hands with a joyful exclamation, and, in a moment after a messenger falcon stooped in perch upon her wrist. This was of the species Falco peregrinus of the pampas, but much improved in size and plumage from culture. Its greeting, as with the first, was replete with pleasurable animation, extending its wings in impulsive sway to the voluntary and involuntary action of its talons, peculiar to birds and beasts of prey, when subject to intensified sensual gratification. As with the cat kind, who make their “friendly” satisfaction manifest by extending and contracting the sheath muscles of the claws, the falcon unconsciously closed its talons upon the wrist of its mistress, causing her to utter, with the painful punctures, “Soh, soh, Merlin, mon brachiale!” Captain Greenwood, observing the flow of blood from her wrist, quickly supplied her with a pair of gauntlets. Merlin, when again restored to her wrist, seemed to understand the intention 84of the buckskin proviso, for he used his talons in the expressive ruffling and extending of his wings; succeeding with his coquetry in attracting her attention from the train of meditation in which she appeared to be engaged, he raised his wings upright, exposing beneath parchment scripts; these removed he leisurely commenced a survey of his surroundings. After their perusal she wrote a few words in reply upon some French tissue paper furnished by M. Hollydorf; this secured in Merlin’s sacks, he desired Captain Dow to take note of the bird’s course, before it rose to its poise, as it would guide him to the opening of the pass in the foot-hills. After the bird in floating flight had reached the point of designation, it soared to its poise and in descent quickly disappeared from view.
<br> 
<br> When the train was fully in motion, Correliana beckoned Captain Greenwood apart, and then to his surprise addressed him in English, with slow, measured enunciation the involumed supplication “Will-you-come-to-us-if-we-are-successful? We-are-happy-among-ourselves,-and-if-you-love-happiness-as-we-enjoy-it-in-our-simplicity,-and-your-educated-habits-will-permit-you-to-love-me,-without-regret-from-other-cause-than-my-own-demerits,-there-will-be-great-joy-in-store-for-us.”
<br> 
<br> The captain’s faculties, notwithstanding his bewildered amazement caused by her sudden acquisition of power to express her thoughts in English, and with such clearness his most coveted desire, in terms so agreeable to his perception of her worth, answered with prompt energy, in quick imitation of her method, “If-my-life-is-spared-I-will-visit-you-soon!”
<br> 
<br> After a moment’s hesitation, as if to realize the full comprehension of his reply, she, with a sudden flush of joyful animation, exclaimed, “I-am-certain-you-feel-that-my-happiness-depends-upon-the-consummation-of-our-love-in-Heraclea!” Then with the proffer 85of salutation, she answered to the hastening call of Captain Dow.
<br> 
<br> This parting scene between Captain Greenwood and Correliana caused M. Hollydorf’s countenance to become overcast with a rueful shadow of dismay. At nine o’clock the train reached the foot-hills where they exchanged their last farewell signals with those left under Tortugan protection. On the fifth day after their departure from the anchorage of the Tortuga, the train had gained the eastern slope of the highest mountain pass that opened to their view the Betongo valleys, with but one interruption to their progress from Indian opposition, which was quickly turned aside.
<br> 
<br> On the first of July, while in midway descent to the valley, the falcons returned after a short flight over a wooded district to the left of their course, which was interpreted by Correliana as an indication of danger from an approaching party of Indians. This startling news caused the greatest activity. While Captain Dow reconnoitred with his glass the descent for a point of advantage for their reception, his two cannoniers prepared the howitzer charges for immediate action. Fortunately they were able to reach a comparatively level plat that offered for their train’s protection the vantage of a natural rampart, which was improved for the reception of the gun with a wall of stones serving as a mask. When the defensive preparations were completed, the pack train, under its guard of women, was sheltered behind it as far in the rear as possible.
<br> 
<br> While yet engaged in strengthening our position for their reception, a large body of Indians on horseback debouched from a wooden pass upon the plateau below. It was evident from their movements, when collected for consultation, that they were aware of our near approach, and when discovered would be set upon immediately. That the crisis might be hastened, 86and the obstruction to our progress removed as speedily as possible, the weakness of our party in numbers was exposed outside of the temporary walls of the fortification as a temptation for speedy onset. Their eyes were soon directed toward us, at first with silent curiosity, then after a short consultation they sprang upright upon the croups of their horses, and commenced brandishing their spears and clubs, with the evident intention of intimidation. Accessions to their number were constantly appearing from different quarters showing that our progress had been watched. Nearly an hour elapsed before a forward movement was attempted. Their waiting delay enabled us to strengthen our position. They commenced their approach with feats of equitation that would have delighted a circus audience, seemingly determined to entertain us to the death. Indeed, their evolutions, which were timed to a war song and dance with a display of acrobatic agility as they advanced at a gallop, attracted our admiration. When within six or seven hundred yards they came to a sudden halt, then after a short “palaver” they reformed in sections, which commenced an involved circle dance, the horses performing their parts without prompting from bridle or lash. The object of the entertainment was soon apparent in the narrowing space between the outer circle and our rubble stone wall. Jack, although amused with the nearing foes’ tactics, nursed the fuse fire of his linstock with watchful care, Bill keeping the howitzer in range with their rising advance to the point intended for the discharge of their spears. While yet without the bounds of their spears’ range, quick as thought the whole band were in full career toward our cover, the foremost launching their spears at everything human exposed. The ducking and dodging on our side was naturally and skillfully executed, but not in every instance gracefully. Jack reached the ground in the style of turtles sunning 87themselves on a water log, when surprised by urchins with a flight of stones, but in his descent did not lose his presence of mind, for the report of the howitzer was simultaneous with the report of the rifles. The massing of the horses in the onset caused a fearful havoc. The effect produced upon the survivors, from the turmoil of bewilderment, subjected them to a second and third discharge of the cannon and rifles; then in view of the slaughter the mayorong’s pity was excited, and with imploring signs he petitioned Captain Dow to withhold the fire of his men. The cessation allowed the Indians to recover from their daze, but panic succeeding, they dispersed wildly in flight, giving expression to the tumultuous effect of fear in attitudinal variations, which, in equestrian display, exceeded in diversity those improvised as a prelude to the battle.
<br> 
<br> When the last of the fugitives had disappeared, it was discovered that Correliana had sustained the only injury inflicted from the cast of spears. Fearing that her protectors, in amused scorn for the unwarlike antics of the foe, would allow them to attain their intention of securing, with the impetus of onset, an effective range for their weapons, she had risen to caution Captain Dow, when in the act a spear grazed her shoulder inflicting a flesh wound. This had been immediately cared for by the Kyronese women, and her anxiety and pain were so slight that she rallied the two sailors, who were sincerely affected with sympathy for her safety, on the speedy methods they adopted in avoidance of the spears.
<br> 
<br> Jack with a humorous smile, rendered comical by the perceptible movement of his tongue, as if in the act of revolving a quid from side to side of his mouth, replied: “To be sure it was sum’ut lubberish to your ledyship’s eyes, but it’s a way we learned at sea to draw the enemy’s fire.”
<br> 
<br> The effect of our arms had been terrible, the dead 88and wounded Indians greatly outnumbering the shots fired; the predominance of the latter bespoke in plain terms either the unpracticed skill of the Kyronese in the use of firearms, or their more probable instinctive humanity. Captain Dow, anxious to retrieve lost time, had the wounded and dead bodies of the Indians removed for the passage of the train. The mayorong caused the former to be tenderly carried into the inclosure, and when the train had passed beyond the human obstructions, he requested permission to remain with the elder matrons that they might bestow some relief upon the suffering until their companions recovered from their panic, promising to overtake them before they encamped for the night. Although the objects of his delay received but little sympathy from the members of the corps, and its male adjuncts, they could not refuse the request, but insisted that he should retain a sufficient number of his men as a guard for their safety. When the moon rose we had gained the valley of the Betongo, and the rare beauty of the scenery, under its resplendent light, invited us onward; but the mayorong’s party had not overtaken us, which caused some anxiety, but this was soon dissipated by their appearance. Urged on by the delightful prospect, heralding the speedy attainment of our journey’s object, we were enabled to encamp in a shaded nook upon the banks of the Betongo river. Notwithstanding the lateness of the hour, the Kyronese added game and fresh fish to our delayed repast.
<br> 
<br> With the morning’s dawn we moved onward over a paved causeway, with its massive stones still intact after untold centuries of wear from Time’s detrite usage. Inland from this shaded causeway, we passed Indian villages at intervals of a few miles, pleasantly located upon knolls surrounded with banana, corn, and vegetable plantations. One of the largest we entered, but found it deserted; there were, however, abundant evidences of its recent occupation. Finding 89an abundant supply of roasted corn, dried fish, and other edibles, an equal quantity was taken from each house, the hampers of the mules furnishing cloths in exchange. The site of each village was connected by a branch causeway with that of the river’s bank, confirming the relation of Correliana.
<br> 
<br> To kill, rout, and destroy, is the orthodox inculcation of civilized progression; so in view of relieving the inhabitants of the besieged city from the besiegers’ stores of provision, we resolved to visit all the villages in our route, and mulct from their abundance as much food as we could transport with our limited means of carriage, leaving with each an equivalent. Dr. Baāhar advocated the total destruction not only of the provision left, but of the plantations and villages, in opposition to the mayorong’s pleading expostulations for their preservation. But the doctor urged the curative plan of extirpation of the sources of vitality, as the only authorized means sustained by classical experience for rendering the enemy’s efforts nugatory. “For,” said he, “it will be neither consistent or prudent to leave your enemies the means of prosecuting their unrelenting siege of Heraclea.” The mayorong, with sad deprecation, pleaded that acts of revengeful destruction would only enrage, and in naught avail the beleaguered; as they would increase the inveteracy of hatred, with justice, against the white race, that so not only the lives and peaceful happiness of the Heracleans would be sacrificed, but others with like kindly intentions. For in making others suffer needlessly, we cannot hope through futile intimidation to be spared ourselves, if an opportunity for revengeful reprisal should occur? This half soliloquized questioning appeal of the mayorong, seemed to be addressed to all, and from the impression conveyed by his intonations in speaking, its truthfulness, when interpreted, was sanctioned with general approval. Still, although manifestly grateful for the 90appreciation of the majority, his countenance lacked the fullness of satisfaction that the hearty concurrence of Dr. Baāhar would have afforded. But the doctor, with the proverbial fatuity of the precedentalist, substituted for the required solace the revised saw, “they thought themselves wiser in their generation than their forefathers,” evidently with the intention of reproving his associates for their defection from the transmitted creed of warful usage. That there might be no lack in the practical support of the mayorong’s behest, Correliana left as equivalents, in exchange for food, a large proportion of the cherished gifts bestowed by Captain Greenwood.
<br> 
<br> Determined to reach the besieged city before midday on the morrow, we did not halt until the dividing range of hills, that separated the upper and lower valleys of old Heraclea, had been surmounted. Upon the shaded summit overlooking the vegas we encamped for the night. The cool refreshing breeze that swept over the hill, and an abundant supply of sweet grass for recruiting the strength of the horses and mules, lured us to delay our start on the following morning, until the sun had dispersed the mists from the valleys. When the fleecy veil was at length dissipated, an enchanting view was presented upon either hand extending as far as the eye could reach. Paved roads or causeways followed the windings of the river and canals through all the alluvial districts. These were of easy detection from the checkered overgrowth of brambled weeds, which ever delight to erect their prickly domes and spires above the ruins of palaces, churches, monumental tombs, and the most splendid mechanical achievements of man, as if in derision of his instinctive claims to immortality, after a life spent in arrogant oppressions, and thorny assumptions, opposed to the kindred sympathy of reciprocal goodness. While the Kyronese were bestowing their kindly attention upon the animals, 91M. Hollydorf, with barometrical aid, calculated the altitude of the valley above the plain of the Tortuga, and found that its elevation exceeded four thousand and nine hundred feet. But with heat lessened by only a few degrees from the tropical zenith, the valley, from its still continued facilities for irrigation, appeared to be the scene of perpetual verdure. Its altitude gave a climate, from mountain inclosure, especially adapted for the cultivation of exotic fruits and cereals, of which, in wild growth, there were abundant specimens.
<br> 
<br> While Correliana was in thoughtful meditation, overlooking the beautiful scene, her attention was attracted to the labors of Mr. Welson, who was engaged in writing out his diuretic observations upon the developed phases of instinct. With Dr. Baāhar’s aid, he, at her request, imparted in outline the result of his labors, which he styled, “A Relative Exposition of Instinctive Traits Common to Animal Life.” Under this head he had classified those common to savage and civilized humanity, in the following order. Poison, Material and Immaterial. The lowest grades of savage life use material poison almost exclusively, as a destructive agent in their intercourse with each other. Representatives of civilized nations compound with speech vituperative venom, which is as deadly in its effect upon happiness, as material poison upon the body. Its insinuating use, in language, is a speciality of women who have suffered in reputation from its taint, and in turn, to conceal their own frailties, use it as an imperative means of counter irritation to blind the censure of their kind. Illustrative examples of savage and civilized superstition, compared by an experiment upon savage and civilized representatives of the human family. Both submissive to instinctive fear. The savage is dubbed a knight with the collar and conferred order of Bath. His departure, after the ceremony of consecration, in pursuit of adventures. 92Reptile duel between a Boisdean serpent and an Alligator. Instinctive tactics of displayed strategy. Guacho “sympathy” enlisted for the weaker party. Reverse. Result of civilized arbitration. Correliana readily interpreted the satirical import of Mr. Welson’s comprehensive method of illustration; but questioned if the women of civilized society had ever in fact given truthful cause for the expressed venom of his satire. In answer, he referred her to M. Hollydorf, as a more ready exponent, who would truthfully inform her whether he had by insinuation libeled the market value of female “virtue” as a negotiable article of appraisement in the gossiping marts of fashionable society? Still puzzled, in the absence of the referee, she applied to Dr. Baāhar for a direct elucidation of the word “virtue,” which she had so often heard him make use of in conversation. The doctor in explanation said, that in the highest caste relations of female association, termed fashionable society, the word virtue was used as a compendious cloak for the concealment of instinctive gratification, which remained unblemished in its sanctity of expression, while it remained impenetrable to the searching eye of scandal.
<br> 
<br> At this stage of her sophistic bewilderment, the mayorong directed their attention to the nearest village. The Indian women having discovered their encampment, were waving their trophies, obtained from involuntary exchange, with jubilant manifestations of happy elation. At this exhibition, after a suitable recognition had been made by Jack and Bill, who waved aloft, from their gun carriage, bunches of bananas, all turned with thankful expression to the mayorong, who had so earnestly advocated the conciliatory means adopted, so that he was fain to have recourse to his animal charges to conceal his emotions. Dr. Baāhar, however, could not withhold a disdainful expression of chagrin, that the chief of a wandering 93tribe, without a pedigree, or a home, should presume to plume himself upon his approved controversion of national usage that had been revered from time immemorial as the sanctified source of wisdom.
<br> 
<br> Correliana turning to the two sailors, whose countenances were moved with joyful emotions from the Indian women’s grateful demonstrations of pleasure, asked how it happened that they were able to retain their destructive presence of mind when forced to evade the Indians’ spears by a disordered movement? Her slow enunciation of English gave Jack time to work up his “reckoning” for an answer, which he gave with the blush of shamefacedness peculiar to the British sailor when accosted by a “lady,” deepened by the reminder, that to his sensitiveness implied the “white feather.” “You see, your ladyship, those Indian chaps had been cutting up their antics so long, we sort o’ lost our lay, but they brought us too with their spears, so we returned the compliments of the season in our fashion. Th’of as Bill says, we’d much rather had the dig of the spear than it should have touched you by our ducking.”
<br> 
<br> This new source of sensitiveness they had conjured through self-reproof, from the impression that their bodies might have averted the course of the spear. But when assured that she was out of their range when she received the wound, they were greatly comforted. Jack expressing his relief in the phrase, “things being as they were, it couldn’t be helped!”
<br> 
<br> As we proceeded on our way, along the eastern margin of the broad southeastern valley, our progress was overlooked by the women and children of the villages, who waved as we passed, our “forage” exchanges of yesterday, with an evident civilized interpretation of gratitude expressed in favor of their neighbors. But our supply of provisions being accommodated to our means of transportation, we could not gratify the desire that prompted the acceptance of 94their overtures. Evidently interpreting the cause, we found upon rounding a hill in advance a herd of cows panniered with bunches of bananas, plantains, and other edibles waiting for our acceptance, the donors watching us from the leafy screens of the hill plantations. The contraband gift—for their male protectors were evidently absent—was too acceptable, for the prospective relief of want, to be refused, and the recompense was suited to the full gratification of the womanly promptings suggesting bestowal.
<br> 
<br> In descending from a hill in advance, the valley proper of old Heraclea opened to our view. The plain, under the golden light of the morning sun, exceeded in beauty of variegation as in extent the famed vega of Granada, when clothed in the productive vestments of Moorish culture. At nine o’clock we passed the field fortalice commanding a view of the valley, and through the river gate those below. It had evidently been designed for a signal station and barracks for those employed to guard the ripening crops; the necessity for its erection bespeaking the inaugurated reign of oppression. The rock used in its construction, as well as of the bridges, dykes, and bank supports of the canals, was basaltic. Unlike granite, marble, and other stones used for building, it had withstood the disintegration of friction and chemical action through the lapse of ages with scarcely perceptible change. The style of architecture bore a strong resemblance to that inaugurated by Cestius, and introduced some sixty years before the Christian era. Our way from the tower to the hill city of old Heraclea, was a paved roadway overshadowed with relict growths of trees, whose ancestry had probably “ennobled” it with shade as an avenue of recreation for the citizens. Reaching the headland of the city esplanade, its level was gained by a zigzag ascent of the same breadth with its connecting avenue, its gradations being easy and of curious construction. 95Gaining the esplanade we were surprised to find its dimensions so extensive, as from below we scarcely conceived its plain would exceed an acre in area, whereas in reality it afforded a promenade that appeared to approach in length and breadth a half of a mile. As in the avenue below, the remains of parapet seats, and protected spaces for trees, were everywhere apparent. Entering from the esplanade, which extended in narrowed proportion to the gateway, through the single broad street of the first walled inclosure built for its protection, we passed to the fora, around which were the houses of those preferred to its distinctive advantages from the ruling qualifications reverenced, as godlike, from the fluent flow of speech. Built in an amphitheatre its walled defense could be made certain against the united tribes of the aboriginal race without, while the system of construction combined economy in space and in labor, giving evidence of emergency from doubtful crisis. The first inclosure had probably furnished ample space for the accommodation of its founders. Passing from the nucleus by the nether street of the fora, we entered the second surrounding, which corresponded in breadth with the original. The third and last, bespoke the disruptive reign of sensual gratification, heralding dissolution. Its expanded breadth from wall of circumvallation to nucleus, must have exceeded the distance of a mile, the palaces being detached from it by gardens and outhouses, the latter subserving the purpose devised from original intention. The structures retained, almost unimpaired, their original perfection; while within many of the heavier household utensils were found in place, touched lightly, from the comparative dryness of the climate, by an age of centuries’ duration. These indications proclaiming the sudden calamity of successful insurrection, and extermination, were to be seen in every direction.
<br> 
<br> 96Leaving this city solitude, once peopled by the instinctively thoughtless and “gay,” we gained the summit of the dividing ridge separating the Betongo from the Vermejo valley. A glance sufficed in answer for the question of causes that led to the selection of the “New City’s” site as a safe place for recreative resort. Limited in extent, and remote from the larger cultivated district, it could not be made available as a permanent place of residence for the guard of growing crops; but was naturally adapted for the indulgence of luxurious ease in a revoltful country, as its walls inclosed sufficient arable land for the support of a limited number of inhabitants, while its natural and artificial aids for defense rendered it impregnable against aboriginal weapons, without taxing the energies of the citizens. Our introductory glances of admiration were arrested by tokens of recognition which greeted us from the citizens, who had assembled along the guard walk of the southern parapet in waiting expectation of our appearance. Their signals soon informed us of the enemy’s position, which was in a grove surrounding a temple, and reaching from it to the road of descent at its escarped junction with the level avenue leading to the city gate.
<br> 
<br> In consultation for the devisement of means for dislodging them, Dr. Baāhar, and the curators of sound, still urged the precedent of classical experience, which advocated the greatest possible destruction of life when engaged in war with barbarous nations and tribes. Notwithstanding the pleading appeal inspired by the sight of her distressed relatives, Correliana manifested strong emotions of repugnance against the wanton destruction of life, even when the advocates strengthened their advice by quoting the padre’s experience on board of the Tortuga. Turning to Mr. Welson and the mayorong for their support, she was relieved by the former’s humorous expression, as he asked Dr. Baāhar to enumerate the number of generations that 97had passed, since his ancestors could urge equally well merited judgment for their own destruction? Then turning to Mr. Dow he asked whether he would prefer to seal the fruition of his hopes with slaughter, or the more lasting effect that would be insured by arousing their superstitious fears. Although urgently impatient of any delay to the full realization of his historical source of fame, his respect for the pungent elements of his questioner’s resources caused him to offer his willing acquiescence if an effectual plan could be suggested for insuring their dispersion. Correliana asked the sailors through Mr. Welson if they could not think of some way to frighten the Indians without injury, as she could not bear the thought of exposing to death and mutilation the husbands, fathers and brothers of the women who had bestowed so gratefully of their means for the relief of those who were descended from their oppressors. After the two sailors had “put their heads together to overhaul their lockers,” Jack said, if he knew exactly where the enemy lay, he could in a giffin fix a shell so that it would scream like a broadside of devils before it burst; and th’of they were civilized, and not up to the thing, they would scud like swallows caught in a gale at sea. The sailors’ invention was adopted, and when everything was in readiness for all the emergencies that could be anticipated, the descent was commenced; but notwithstanding the eminency of danger, admiration gained the sway, attracted by the natural beauties developed at every turn in our downward course. The skill displayed for the artificial improvement of the natural advantages, would also have received like commendation if the means employed had not excited emotions of abhorrence. For the Indians who accomplished these labors of Heraclean devisement were in fact the benefactors of their oppressors.
<br> 
<br> Having arrived at the desired position for the essay 98of Jack’s “devilish experiment” the shell was belched forth from the howitzer upon its frightful mission. Its screaming powers had not been overrated by the projectors, but it exploded before it had accomplished half of its intended distance, seemingly in the very midst of the concealed foe, for the grove became swayingly alive from the panic imparted to its wooded growths. Moving rapidly forward, a second shell, true to its intention, accelerated the flight into a rout as wild with dismay as was ever enacted by congeneric warriors with civilized instincts.
<br> 
<br> Advancing to the bridge spanning the river moats to either bank of their conjoined stream, the city gates were open and the parents of Correliana stood upon the threshold waiting to bestow with tearful gratitude their acknowledgments for opportune deliverance from the manifold perils to which they had been subject. After they had bestowed upon their daughter tokens of affectionate welcome, in which all present joined with kindred sympathy, we were ushered in and made the centre of grateful attraction. It soon became painfully apparent from their wan features and tottering steps, that their vital energies were reduced to the lowest ebb from over anxiety and the want of suitable nourishment; so we at once mustered our prepared resources, and became their directing entertainers. Even the saturnine dignity of Mr. Dow, and the patronizing sagery of Dr. Baāhar, relaxed under the beneficent influence imparted from their ministering attentions. When the pr?tor and tribunes requested an introduction to the patriarch of the Kyronese, his absence was first noticed by the members of the corps, Correliana, and his granddaughters; when in the act of apologizing for his absence and the elder matrons, they were seen issuing from the temple grove; with their welcome the gates were closed and the sailors placed in charge. Then the Heracleans were placed upon the sillias of the horses 99and mules,—notwithstanding their earnest protests of ability to walk,—while each, as they proceeded up the avenue of the latifundium, was attended with the sympathetic support of the Kyronese and members of the corps. At the oppidum vera gates, nearly a mile distant from the cinctus, or outer wall gates, the Heracleans insisted upon dismounting, thankfully accepting the Kyronese proffers of assistance in rendering service to the sick. Correliana then directed us to the quarters prepared for our use, expressing the hope that the condition of her people would afford ample explanation for whatever was found lacking or amiss for the assurance of comfort in their accommodations? Having unpacked and disposed of our instruments and personalities in the house prepared for us, an evening consultation was held to devise means for the purveyance of supplies for the nearly famished inhabitants. Feeling certain that the besiegers were effectually dispersed, the hunting of wild game was proposed as a dernier for present support.
