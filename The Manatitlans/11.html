This petition awakened a pleasing smile in the expression of the pr?tor’s face, who, without consulting his associates, requested his daughter to proffer his fealty to the united chiefs and their tribes of the valleys, in behalf of the citizens of Heraclea, with the hope that they would trustfully extend their permission for the continued occupation of lands alienated by the cruel oppressions of their ancestors of old Heraclea. When, with some difficulty, Correliana was able to make them understand the nature of this request, they pondered, and looked upon each other in bewildered silence. At length, one of the oldest Betongese chiefs, “saw the approaching ends of the long severed thread of unity that had caused the siege of hatred, and the concession offered by the pr?tor for uniting it with the durable bonds of privileged equality.” His explanation was received by his compadric chiefs with smiling assent, assured that it was for mutual behoofment. With united sanction, evidences of mutual understanding were passed in tokens of goodwill, until the rays of the sun, in decline, were cast aslant from the brink of the precipice of the falls, covering with its bright canopy the shadows that enveloped the city beneath, then in strengthened concord the p?an hymn of thanksgiving 108rose in unison from every Heraclean threshold, and after it a responsive refrain repeated in swelling harmony from group to group. Of its import M. Hollydorf gave the following rendition,—
<br> “Neighbors good-night, good-night;
<br> A day of right,
<br> Without a wrong,
<br> Hallows our evening song.”
<br> 
<br> At an early hour of the day, succeeding the arrival of the Kyronese detachment, Indian women brought fresh fish and fruits as presents, then volunteered their service for clearing the houses, colonnades, and patios of the accumulations consequent upon the sickness of the Heracleans, and were made happy by the acceptance of their proffered aid. Gradually the cheerless gloom which had held sway in the depopulated portions of the city for ages, from the harassed anxiety of its defenders, passed away under the active hands of the Kyronese and their Indian aids. Fountains, whose conduits had become choked, were opened and cleaned, causing the house gardens and latifundium to rejoice in primal gladness from water distribution above and below the surface of the ground. The loving sympathy of the Heracleans made manifest in the tender care bestowed upon the reviving sick, brought forth the latent gentleness of the corps, which had been suppressed from childhood by the civilized decrees of fashionable folly and vanity, begot from the precedental inoculation of habits and customs derived from the heroic ages of classical brutality. Indeed the members of the corps were so often moved to express genial emotions with glistening tears commingled with smiles, they seemed to have developed a new inherent combination as necessary for the joyful expression of happiness, as sun and showers for the behests of fruitful vegetation. The padre, in his quaint emphatic style, expressed the prevailing influence in an evening salutation addressed to his 109compadre Dr. Baāhar after even song, in this wise: “Well I declare, doctor, upon my soul, I have passed such a happy day in useful labor that it seems as if I had just emerged from a life’s nightmare of torpid inactivity. Really, upon my hopes of salvation, I believe that I could live and thrive upon the joys of others, without material food.”
<br> 
<br> But the doctor, who was impaling the insect game obtained from his day’s hunting excursion, replied sneeringly. “So, so, h-m—I see, you are taken in, with the others, by this humdrum life of these Heracleans, with their puling, wishee-washy affectations of caring more for others than they do for themselves. The long and short of the matter is, that you are all subject to an unnatural influence, and if it is not thrown off immediately, from whatever source derived, you will shortly forswear manliness, and your hopes of heaven.”
<br> 
<br> This baited injunction caused the padre to exclaim, “My goodness gracious, doctor, you frighten me! I hope you don’t truly think there’s anything like magic or sorcery used upon us here? To be sure, now that I remember, I have had strange thoughts, to which I have never been accustomed to before! But they have been in motive pure, urging the necessity of controlling the appetites and passions, if we would attain the abiding confidence of a trustful affection, that outreaches self. But then, as you know, the devil can preach, and practice too, if it so minds him, self-condemnation?”
<br> 
<br> “Certes, the fact is,” replied the doctor, “you are subject to vagaries when your stomach is empty, and require to feel the force of sound German philosophy that urges substantial fullness as the source of generous impressions, eloquence, and heroic deeds, and for exorcism thorough fumigation with tobacco smoke.”
<br> 
<br> M. Hollydorf, from the intervention of multiplied causes, had procrastinated the inauguration of his 110scientific explorations, until compelled to enter upon the duties of his commission through fear that inquiries would be instituted to learn the cause of his long silence. Fully aware that the manifold attractions of Correliana had served to abate his professional enthusiasm, and urgency of his desire to fulfill the trust reposed in his discretion, he resolved to make a test of his naturalistic occupation for the diversion of his thoughts from an object of hopeless attainment. Notwithstanding his knowledge that her affections were irrevocably fixed, he could not withhold the manifestation of a hopeful desire in her presence, within the limits of reverential respect. Correliana, on her part, seemed to fully understand the import of his attentions, but was in no way embarrassed by their indulgence, which with her frankness appeared inexplicable. When he expressed his intention of commencing his microscopical field investigations, she asked the privilege of assisting him when free from the indispensable duties of the household; promising, if her request was granted, to be diligent for advancement in scientific knowledge. She was promptly accepted as a catechumenic aid, notwithstanding the promptings of his judgment which suggested that with the ever present cause of his disquietude, his remedy would prove of little avail for relief. But he determined, with a lover’s infatuation, to converse with her as an abstract divested of material embodiment.
<br> 
<br> On the first day of November, while engaged in preparing his instruments after evening song, M. Hollydorf was surprised with a visit from the pr?tor and family. Observing that the unusual hour caused fear that some mishap had occurred, Correliana hastened to relieve the anticipation of evil tidings by stating the object of the visit. “My father,” she said, “has been delegated to proffer you the perpetual hospitality of Heraclea. Not, however, with the 111design that you should hold it as an acknowledgment of service rendered, but rather as the promptings of affectionate esteem for your companionship. As you are aware, we have no practical knowledge of the world beyond our city walls, and feel that in winning from you a reciprocation of our affection, we shall be advised of a course that will avail us as a protection against the grasping cupidity you have described as the inherent motive power of civilization. To be forced to adopt habits of corruption, in defiance of local option, because your enlightened civilization holds that the power to enforce their arbitrary despotisms with brute strength, aided by destructive mechanical adjuncts, is right; would, with the introduction of ‘luxurious’ poisons which frenzy and degrade the human instincts, make us regret with anguish our liberation from the deadly intent of our savage foes. For their speedy poison, with its putrefactive torments, does not degrade the animus of goodness, but relieves it from material bondage in purity for immortal association with those who have gone before. We feel self-conscious that we are in intention pure and free from cupidity, which assures us that we merit the affectionate interest that you have bestowed for our liberation and welfare. This much we will advance for initiation without infringing upon the more matured wisdom in store for your direction. With the full development of our loving resources, we feel confident in securing your permanent residence among us, as advisors, in warding off those who would, for the gratification of craving instinctive cupidity, sacrifice our well-assured happiness, from which we realize in life a foretaste of immortality (smiling). Fortunately, the sage suggestion which led Mr. Welson to confer the honor of knighthood upon the savage for the indomitable bravery of his instinctive propensity to inflict deadly wounds with his teeth, has relieved us from anxiety from his kindred; 112and if we can persuade the grand master ‘Lobscounster’ to take up his abode in our midst, his influence may extend to the orders of civilization, for our protection in the enjoyment of affectionate association. If he will but exert his power to protect us from the forced invasions of trade, that would palm upon our weakness noxious devices, which in naught would advantage the invaders, but make us wretched beyond measure, he will insure our eternal gratitude.”
<br> 
<br> Mr. Welson in response said,—The eminent Lobscounster, if insured from increasing merit a continuance of Heraclean favor, he cannot be forced from his allegiance, and in earnest of his intention thankfully accepted the extended privilege of becoming their permanent guest. But would most devoutly beg to decline acceptance of the cognomic title bestowed upon him by the savage embogator; as to the English ear it was euphonious with smack of a descent from an ancient sea cook, and in no way likely to insure reverence among sea-faring men. Indeed, the individual referred to would have strongly suspected collusive substitution if the interpreter had been well versed in the aquatic lore of ocean English.
<br> 
<br> When the visitors were about leaving, M. Hollydorf announced his intention of entering upon his microscopical investigations on the morrow, reminding Correliana of her promise to render him assistance.
<br> 
<br> “With life and health I shall most assuredly be present,” replied Correliana, “for I have a woman’s curiosity to test the wonderful magnifying powers of your instruments, which so far exceed our untutored conceptions of mechanical refinement. As we have some practical knowledge derived from the observations of animalculan life, we hope that our assistance in your department of science may eventuate in relieving your anxiety, occasioned by the delay incurred 113from the aid you have rendered our people.” With this enigmatical proposition, bespoken with the earnest zest of sincerity peculiar to all her variations, Correliana and her parents bade the members of the corps good-night. Long after the departure of their visitors, the members of the corps, puzzled and perplexed by Correliana’s seemingly frank intention, commingled with implied reservations, and a knowledge of the world incompatible with the complete isolation to which their people had been subjected for ages, endeavored to unravel the clew to her powers of premonition.
<br> 
<br> After listening in silence for a long time to the various suggestive expositions of others, the padre suddenly exclaimed, “You may reason and think what you please, but for my own part I know that I have not been myself since she first came on board of the Tortuga; and if everything was fair and above board, as they would have us believe by their words and actions, they would speak out at once, and not hold anything back to make us feel doubtful of our souls’ safety. For by the mouths of a cloud of witnesses, we know that the powers of darkness have wrought from the beginning of the world their designs for the temptation of souls, through the agency of woman’s allurements; and for myself I can truly say, that I can’t avoid doing as she wishes to have me without a word of direction. Besides I am altogether too happy to have it natural or lasting; and the method of educating their children separate from each other, and away from the example of their parents, is barbarous and unnatural.”
<br> 
<br> At the completion of this impulsive padric, Mr. Welson quietly observed,—“If we are to judge from appearances, we could not question the source of your improvement. But as appearances are deceptive, and the evil-disposed seek solitude for indulgence, the cloud of a witness rose from beneath the skirt of your 114coat, with the odor of tobacco from your suddenly concealed pipe, to confirm your shame in the presence of purity. If your soul has been tempted, it has been from gross indulgence to purity.”
<br> 
<br> The padre abashed relapsed into silence. But Dr. Baāhar, who had for a butterfly consideration furnished him with the means of indulgence, undertook his vindication, which he commenced with the syllogistic proposition: “We will certainly admit that your spasmodic sarcasms are poetical refinements upon fact, but I contend that you are neither scientific or logical in your deductions. If God created man with reasoning instincts, they were undoubtedly intended for invention and indulgence. Again, in depriving children of their natural protectors’ care and example, is in open controversion of Divine will. As for me, I do not assume to be more wise in my day, than my ancestors were in theirs. By the assumptions of your theory, founded upon the partial knowledge of these egotistical Heracleans, who have been shut out from a knowledge of the world from time immemorial, we should repudiate the transmitted experience of our ancestors. I shall not be guilty of so gross an act of ingratitude; my father the counselor, and his progenitors, ate their saur-kraut and sausages, drank their beer, smoked their pipes, and were excellent swordmen and genealogists, and I intend to do honor to the habits they inculcated.”
<br> 
<br> Pettynose the buzz recorder of sound, and Lindenhoff the genealogical curator of sound, with Viscouswitzs the photographic artist, sided with Dr. Baāhar, the latter sensuously remarking: “The women may be accounted puritanically beautiful, but they lack the bouquet of civilization, as well as the natural flavor peculiar to the creole variations; and as to pleasure, I could derive as much by an association with marble busts in the atélier of a sculptor. There is an air of repulsiveness about them that repels geniality, 115so that I never feel comfortable in their presence, and but for the encampment of the Vermejo Indians on the lake, I would, with the first opportunity, throw up my engagement and return to the haunts of civilization; for of all things I abhor pedantry in men and puritanism in women.”
<br> 
<br> “We are as yet novices in the ways of the Heracleans,” urged Mr. Dow, “and but imperfectly understand their motives of action or system of self government. To judge them from our partial impressions, which your personal opinions bespeak, is proof positive that the cavils of surmise, peculiar to individuals, originated the prejudices to which you have given voice. To me the addenda to their morning salutation and evening anthem of praise, as rendered by M. Hollydorf, bore advisory reference to the source of their happiness.” M. Hollydorf fully endorsed Mr. Dow’s views.
