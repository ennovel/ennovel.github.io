The place had narrowed and grown small in every way. There was no horizon, only lines of brick houses; no space, only the breadth of a street; no air to breathe for a man who had come from the wide solitude of the hills, and the keen freshness of the Highland breezes. Everything here was paltry, and monotonous, and small; the people who met him—and he met everybody, and there was not a man who could claim the slightest acquaintance with him, or a woman who had seen him once in her neighbour’s drawing-room who did not now claim acquaintance with Lord Erradeen—seemed to have dwindled along with the scene. They had never been distinguished by intelligence or originality, but he had not been aware how paltry they were before. Had he seen Jeremy’s new turn-out? all the men inquired of him. He had already heard of it from Miss Merivale, who had given him a sketch of the history of the town, and what had happened during his absence, at breakfast. It was a high phaeton, “which I suppose must be the fashion,” Miss Merivale said. “You should really see it,” cried all the young men, with details about the harness and the high-stepping mare which were endless. What did Lord Erradeen care for young Jeremy’s phaeton or the high-stepping mare? but it was the only topic at Sloebury—that, and a report which Miss Merivale had also furnished him with about Julia Herbert. “Your old flame: no doubt it was to console herself in your absence,” said Cousin Sophy. This was disagreeable too. Walter did not care to hear that the girl who had distinguished himself and been distinguished by him should make herself remarkable in a flirtation with another man. He did not want her indeed, but he objected to the transfer of her affections. And everything around looked so barren, stale, flat, and unprofitable. Perhaps it was the quickening of life which his recent experiences, painful though they had been, had brought him, which made him feel how dead-alive everything was. At Loch Houran his mind had gone back to the safe and peaceable commonplace of his native town with something like an enthusiasm of preference for its calm common sense, and superiority to the fever and excitements of that life upon the edge of the supernatural. Now it seemed to him that superstition itself, not to speak of the heats and chills of human passion, were higher things than this cynic-steadiness, this limit of matter-of-fact. What would Sloebury think of those things that had been so real to him, that had rent his very being asunder? He could imagine the inextinguishable laughter with which his story would be greeted, and blushed at the possibility of betraying himself. A seer of ghosts and visions, a victim of mesmerism! He would become in a moment the scorn, as he was at present, the envy, of the town. Not a soul of them would understand. His experiences must be buried in his own bosom, and no one here must ever know that he had got beyond that surface of life to which all their knowledge was confined. When he met Underwood indeed this determination wavered a little: but then Underwood looked at him with an eagerness of inspection which was still more offensive. What did the fellow mean? Did he think it likely that he, a stranger, a person whom the better people disapproved, should be chosen as the confidant of Lord Erradeen?
<br> 
<br> “You have come back very soon,” the captain said; as indeed did everybody whom he met.
<br> 
<br> “No—not sooner than I intended,” said Walter, coldly. “It was business merely that took me there at all.”
<br> 
<br> Underwood examined his face with a curiosity that had knowledge in it. “I know that country so well,” he said. “I should like to know what you think of it. Of course you were at Auchnasheen? I have been weeks there, with the late lord—and at the old castle too,” he added, with a keen look.
<br> 
<br> “You were interested in the architecture, I suppose.”
<br> 
<br> Underwood said nothing for a moment. Then suddenly—“I wish you’d come and talk to me about it!” he cried. “Any time that you will come I’ll shut out everybody else. I’ll keep myself free—”
<br> 
<br> “My dear fellow,” Walter said in a supercilious tone, “why should I make Sloebury pay the penalty, and banish your friends from you for my selfish advantage?” To remember the time when this man had taken notice of him and been his superior, gave him a sense of impatient indignation. “Besides, I don’t know that there is anything to say.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, as you please,” said Underwood; but when they passed each other, he turned back and laid a hand on Walter’s sleeve. “I keep early hours now,” he said. “After ten I am always free.”
<br> 
<br> Lord Erradeen walked away, half-angry, half-amused, by the man’s presumption, who, after all, was a nobody; but yet, he made a secret note in his mind, almost outside of his consciousness. After ten—It might, in the dreadful blank of those hours after ten at Sloebury (or even before ten for that matter), be a resource.
<br> 
<br> He had not gone very much further when he fell into another lion’s mouth. But how wrong, how cruel, to apply such a phrase to the red and smiling mouth, fresh as the cherries in the song, of Miss Julia Herbert, on her way from the rectory where she paid her old aunt a daily visit, to the cottage in which she was her mother’s stay and solace! She had been flirting a great deal in Walter’s absence, no one could deny. A young Wynn, a relation on the other side of the house, had been staying there, on leave from his regiment, and on such an occasion what else was there to do? But young Wynn was gone, and his circumstances were not such as to have stood in competition for one moment with Lord Erradeen. As soon as she saw him, Julia began to smile and wave her hand. If there was a little sense of guilt in her, so much the more reason for even an excess of friendliness now. And perhaps there was in Walter a certain desire to let the little world about, which had insisted upon her little infidelities, perceive that she was as much under his influence as ever, as soon as he chose to appear. This was not the way in which the world regarded the matter, if Walter had known. Instead of looking at him as the conquering hero, who had but to show himself, the spectators said pityingly that Julia Herbert had got hold of poor Lord Erradeen again.
<br> 
<br> “Oh, Walter!” she cried; then changed her tone with a very pretty blush, and said, “I ought to have said Lord Erradeen; but it was the surprise. And so you have come home?”
<br> 
<br> “I have come back,” he said, with a little emphasis.
<br> 
<br> “I see it all. Forgive me that I should be so silly—back, of course; that means a few days, that means you have come for your boxes, or to see your mother, or to know her wishes respecting the new furniture of the banqueting hall. Shall it be medi?val or renaissance? If you ask my advice——”
<br> 
<br> “I do; of course, I do. It is for that chiefly I am here.”
<br> 
<br> “That is what I thought. Renaissance, then. There, you have my opinion—with plenty of cupids and good, fat garlands——”
<br> 
<br> She laughed, and Walter laughed too, though he was not very much amused. But, of course, he could not speak to a lady as he had spoken to Underwood.
<br> 
<br> “Come now, tell me about it,” the young lady said. “You cannot refuse such a little bit of novelty to one who never sees anything new except a novel: and there is so little novelty in them! About what? Oh, about Scotland, and the scenery, and the old castle: and who you met, and what you did. Mayn’t I show a little curiosity—in one whom,” she added with that exaggeration of sentiment which leaves room for a laugh, “I have known all my life?”
<br> 
<br> “That, I hope, is not all the claim I have on your interest,” said Walter in the same tone.
<br> 
<br> “Oh, no, not half. There have been moments!—And then the romance of you, Lord Erradeen! It is delightful to touch upon the borders of romance. And your rank! I feel a great many inches higher, and ever so much elevated in my own estimation, by being privileged to walk by your lordship’s side. When are you going to take your seat and help to rule your country? They say the House of Commons is to be preferred for that. But there is nothing so delightful as a peer.”
<br> 
<br> “How lucky for me that you should think so. I may walk with you, then, to the——”
<br> 
<br> “Corner,” said Julia, “not too far; oh, certainly, not too far: or we shall have all the old ladies, male and female, making comments.”
<br> 
<br> “I don’t care for the old ladies—or their comments,” said Walter: the fun was languid, perhaps, but yet it afforded a little occupation when one had nothing else to do.
<br> 
<br> “You? Oh, of course not, as you will escape presently, and know all my wiles by heart already, it cannot make much difference to you. It is I who have to be considered, if you please, my lord. They will say there is that Julia Herbert at her old tricks, trying to take in poor Lord Erradeen—a poor, innocent young man in the snares of that designing baggage! They will probably add that the police should put a stop to it,” Miss Herbert said.
<br> 
<br> “The deluded old ladies! Without knowing that it is exactly the other way——”
<br> 
<br> “Now that is the prettiest speech you ever made,” said Julia. “I never heard you say anything so nice before. You must have been in very good society since you went away. Tell me, who was it?” she asked with her most insinuating look.
<br> 
<br> They were old practitioners both. They understood each other: they had flirted since they had been in long clothes, and no harm had ever come of it. This is, no doubt, what Miss Herbert would have said had any feminine critic interposed; but there was something more serious, as the feminine critic would have divined, at once, in Julia’s eye. She meant more, not less, than she said; and she was anxious to know, having her eyes upon all contingencies like a wise general, what rivals might have come in the way.
<br> 
<br> “I have met scarcely any one,” said Walter. “You cannot conceive what a lonely place it is. Oh, of course there are people about. I was promised a great many visitors had I stayed. On the other hand, even in winter, it is wonderfully beautiful. Coming back to this perfectly flat country, one discovers for the first time how beautiful it is.”
<br> 
<br> “Yes,” said Julia, indifferently; the beauty of the country did not excite her. “I have seen a photograph of your old castle. You can only get to it by water, Captain Underwood says. Oh, he has been a great authority on the subject since you went away. One of your castles is on Loch Houran; but the others——”
<br> 
<br> “If you like to call them castles,” said Walter, gently flattered by these queries, “there are two of them on Loch Houran. One I call a ruin, and the other a shooting-box——”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, you lucky, lucky person; and a house in town, and another grand place in Scotland! Aren’t you frightened to trust yourself among poor people who have nothing! Don’t you feel alarmed lest we should rush at you and tear you to pieces, and divide your spoils? I am very romantic. I should have the old castle,” she said with a side glance of provocation and invitation.
<br> 
<br> Her watchful eyes perceived a change in his countenance as she spoke. There were limits, it was evident, to the topics her flying hand might touch. She went on cleverly without a pause—
<br> 
<br> “You wonder what I should do with it? Restore it, Lord Erradeen. Build the walls up again, and make everything as it used to be. I should enjoy that—and then the furnishing, how delightful! Don’t you know that the aim and object of every rational being now is to make a little Victorian house look like a big Queen Anne one? or if not that, an Eastern harem with quantities of draperies, and mats and cushions. How much more delightful to have the real thing to work upon!”
<br> 
<br> “But my house is not a Queen Anne house, or an Oriental——”
<br> 
<br> “You don’t like to say the word, you good, delicate-minded young man! Of course not; but a castle like the Mysteries of Udolpho. At all events you must ask mamma and me to pay you a visit, and I shall take my lute like Emily in that beautiful story, and a small but well-chosen collection of books; and then whatever happens—suppose even that you shut my lover up in one of your dungeons——”
<br> 
<br> “Which I should certainly do; nay, hang him on the gallows-hill.”
<br> 
<br> “No, no,” she said, “not hang him; let him have the death of a gentleman. Here we are at the corner. Oh, you are going my way? Well, perhaps that makes a difference. You meant to pay your respects to mamma? I don’t think that I can in that case, Lord Erradeen, interfere with the liberty of the subject; for you have certainly a right, if you wish it, to call on mamma.”
<br> 
<br> “Certainly I have a right. I am prepared to obey you in every other respect; but Mrs. Herbert has always been very kind to me, and it is one of my objects——”
<br> 
<br> “How much improved you are!” cried Julia. “How nice you are! How grateful and condescending! Tell me whom you have been consorting with while you have been away. The Scotch have good manners, I have always heard. Who is your nearest neighbour in your old castle, Lord Erradeen?”
<br> 
<br> Walter cast about in his mind for a moment before he replied. He had no mind to profane the sanctity of the Isle by betraying its gentle inmates to any stranger’s curiosity. He said—“I think my nearest neighbour is a Mr. Williamson—not a distinguished name or person—who has a gorgeous great house and everything that money can buy. That means a great deal. It has all been made by sugar, or some equally laudable production.”
<br> 
<br> “And Mr. Williamson—no, it is not distinguished as names go—has a daughter, Lord Erradeen?”
<br> 
<br> “I believe so, Miss Herbert.”
<br> 
<br> “How solemn we are! It used to be Julia—and Walter. But never mind, when one gets into the peerage one changes all that. ‘One fair daughter, and no more, whom he loved passing well!’”
<br> 
<br> “There is but one, I think; sons in an indefinite number, however, which lessens, I suppose, in a commercial point of view, the value of the lady.”
<br> 
<br> “Lord Erradeen, you fill me with amazement and horror. If that is how you have been taught by your Scotch neighbours——”
<br> 
<br> “Miss Herbert, I am following the lead you have given me—trying humbly to carry out your wishes.”
<br> 
<br> And then they looked at each other, and laughed. The wit was not of a high order, but perhaps that is scarcely necessary to make a duel of this kind between a young man and a young woman amusing. It was more than amusing to Julia. She was excited, her bosom panted, her eyes shone—all the more that Walter’s calm was unbroken. It was provoking beyond measure to see him so tranquil, so ready to respond and follow her lead, so entirely unlikely to go any further. He was quite willing to amuse himself, she said to herself, but of feeling in the matter he had none, though there had been moments.
<br> 
<br> And it did not once occur to her that her antagonist was clever enough to have eluded her investigations, or that the smile upon his face was one of secret pleasure in the secret sanctuary whose existence he had revealed to no one—the little isle in the midst of Loch Houran and the ladies there. He went back to them while all this lively babble went on, seeing them stand and wave their hands to him, as he was carried away over the wintry water. He had come away with relief and eagerness to be gone; but how fair it all looked as he turned back out of this scenery so different from his loch, and from the side of a girl who wanted to “catch” him, Walter knew. Odious words! which it is a shame to think, much less speak, and yet which are spoken constantly, and, alas! in some cases, are true.
<br> 
<br> Notwithstanding this lively consciousness of the young lady’s meaning (which in itself is always flattering and propitiates as much as it alarms), Walter accompanied Julia very willingly to the cottage. He had not thought of going there so soon. It was a kind of evidence of interest and special attraction which he had not meant to give, but that did not occur to him at the moment. The mother and daughter exerted themselves to the utmost to make his visit agreeable. They insisted that he should stay to luncheon, they sang to him and made him sing, and talked and made him talk, and burned delicate incense before him, with jibes and flouts and pretences at mockery. They had the air of laughing at him, yet flattered him all the time. He was such a prize, so well worth taking a little trouble about. The incense tickled his nostrils, though he laughed too, and believed that he saw through them all the time. There was no deception, indeed, on either side; but the man was beguiled and the woman excited. He went away with certain fumes in his brain, and she came down from the little domestic stage upon which she had been performing with a sense of exhaustion, yet success. Miss Williamson, a country beauty, or perhaps not even a beauty, with red hair and a Scotch accent, and nothing but money to recommend her! Money was much to ordinary mortals, but surely not enough to sweep away all other considerations from the mind of a young favourite of fortune. No! Julia believed in a certain generosity of mind though she was not herself sufficiently well off to indulge in it, and she could not think that money, important as it was, would carry the day.
<br> 
<br> In the mean time, it was apparent to all the world that Lord Erradeen had spent the greater part of his first day at Sloebury, at the Cottage; he had stayed to luncheon, he had promised to come back to practise those duets. A young man who has just come into his kingdom, and is therefore in circumstances to marry, and likely in all human probability to be turning his thoughts that way, cannot do such things as this with impunity. If he had not meant something why should he thus have affiché‘d his interest in her daughter, Mrs. Herbert asked herself in polyglot jargon. There was no reason why he should have done so, had he not meant it. Thus Walter walked into the snare though it was so evident, though he saw it very well, and though the sportswoman herself trailed it on the ground before him and laughed and avowed her deep design. In such cases fun and frankness are more potent than deceit.
<br> 
<br> Walter continued in Sloebury for two or three weeks. He found the stagnation of every interest intolerable. He had nothing to do, and though this was a condition which he had endured with much composure for years before, it pressed upon him now with a force beyond bearing. And yet he did not go away. He betook himself to the Cottage to practise those duets almost every day; and presently he fell into the practice of visiting Captain Underwood almost every night; but not to confide in him as that personage had hoped. Underwood soon learned that a reference to Loch Houran made his companion silent at once, and that whatever had happened there the young lord meant to keep it to himself. But though Walter did not open his heart, he took advantage of the means of amusement opened to him. He suffered Captain Underwood to discourse to him about the turf; about horses, of which the young man knew nothing; about the way in which both pleasure and profit might be secured, instead of the ruin to which it is generally supposed that pursuit must lead. Underwood would have been very willing to “put” his young friend “up” to many things, and indeed did so in learned disquisitions which perhaps made less impression than he supposed upon a brain which was preoccupied by many thoughts. And they played a great deal, that deadly sort of play between two, which is for sheer excitement’s sake, and is one of the most dangerous ways of gambling. Walter did not lose so much as might have been expected, partly because his interest was apt to flag, and partly that his companion had designs more serious than those of the moment, and was in no hurry to pluck his pigeon—if pigeon it was, of which he was not yet sure.
<br> 
<br> Thus the young man held himself up to the disapproval of the town, which, indeed, was ready to forgive a great deal to a peer, but “did not like,” as all authorities said, “the way he was going on.” He was behaving shamefully to Julia Herbert, unless he meant to marry her, which she and her mother evidently believed to the derision of all spectators; and to mix himself up so completely with Underwood, and abandon the society of his own contemporaries, were things which it was very difficult to forgive. He did not hunt as he had intended, which would have been an amusement suited to his position, partly because there was a good deal of frost, and partly because it was not an exercise familiar to Walter, who had never had the means of keeping horses. And the football club belonged to the previous ages, with which he now felt so little connection. Therefore, it happened after a time, notwithstanding the charm of his rank, that Sloebury felt itself in the painful position of disapproving of Lord Erradeen. Strange to say, he was very little different from Walter Methven, who was a young fellow who had wasted his time and chances—a kind of good-for-nothing. It was something of an insult to the community in which he lived, that he should be “caught” by the most undisguised flirt, and should have fallen under the influence of the person most like a common adventurer of any in Sloebury. He owed it at least to those who had contemplated his elevation with such a rush of friendly feeling that he should be more difficult to inveigle. Had he still been plain Walter Methven, he could not have been more easily led away.
<br> 
<br> The house in which Walter was the first interest, and which had risen to such high hopes in his elevation, was held in the strangest state of suspense by this relapse into his old ways. The only element of agreeable novelty in it was the presence of Symington, who had taken possession of the house at once, with the most perfect composure and satisfaction to himself. He was the most irreproachable and orderly retainer ever brought into a house by a young man returning home. He gave no trouble, the maids said; he was not proud, but quite willing to take his meals in the kitchen, and did not stand upon his dignity. Presently, however, it appeared that he had got everything in his hands. He took the control of the dinner table, made suggestions to the cook, and even to Mrs. Methven herself when she ordered dinner, and became by imperceptible degrees the chief authority in the house. In this capacity he looked with puzzled and disapproving eyes at his young lord. His first inquiries as to where the horses were kept, and where he was to find his master’s hunting things, being answered impatiently, with an intimation that Walter possessed neither the one nor the other, Symington took a high tone.
<br> 
<br> “You will, no doubt, take steps, my lord, to supply yourself. I hear it’s a fine hunting country: and for a young gentleman like you with nothing to do——”
<br> 
<br> “Don’t you think I can manage my own affairs best?” the young man said.
<br> 
<br> “It’s very likely ye think so, my lord,” with great gravity, Symington said. He was laying the table for luncheon, and spoke sometimes with his back to Walter as he went and came.
<br> 
<br> “I suppose you are of a different opinion?” Walter said, with a laugh.
<br> 
<br> “Not always—not always, my lord. I’ve seen things in you that were very creditable—and sense too—and sense too!” said Symington, waving his hand. “I’m just thinking if I were a young gentleman in your lordship’s place, I would get more enjoyment out of my life. But we never know,” he added piously, “what we might be capable of, if we were exposed to another’s temptations and put in another’s place.”
<br> 
<br> “Let me hear,” said Walter, with some amusement, “what you would do if you were in my place.”
<br> 
<br> “It’s what I have often asked mysel’,” said Symington, turning round, and polishing with the napkin in his hand an old-fashioned silver salt cellar. “Supposing ye were rich and great that are at present nobody in particular, what would ye do? It’s an awful difficult question. It’s far more easy to find fault. We can all do that. Your lordship might say to me, ‘That silver is no what it ought to be.’ And I would probably answer, ‘It’s been in a woman’s hands up till now,’ which he had never taken into consideration. And I may misjudge your lordship in the same way.”
<br> 
<br> “Do you mean to say that I too have been in a woman’s hands? But that is uncivil, Symington, to my mother.”
<br> 
<br> “I would on no hand be unceevil to my lady; and it was not that I was meaning. To my thinking, my lord, you just dinna get enough out of your life. There is a heap of satisfaction to be got out of the life of a lord, when he has plenty of money, and five-and-twenty years of age like you. It is true your lordship is courting, which accounts for many things.”
<br> 
<br> “What do you mean by courting? Come, we have had enough of this,” Lord Erradeen said.
<br> 
<br> “I did not expect, my lord, that you would bide it long, though you were very good-natured to begin with. Courting is just a very well kent amusement, and no ill in it. But I will not intrude my remarks on your lordship. There is one thing though, just one thing,” Symington said, re-arranging the table with formal care. “You’ll no be going north again, my lord, as well as I can reckon, for nigh upon another year?”
<br> 
<br> “What have you to do with my going north?” Walter cried impatiently.
<br> 
<br> “Your lordship forgets that I will have to go with ye, which gives me a hantle to do with it,” said Symington imperturbably; “but that will no be at least till it’s time for the grouse? It will always be my duty:—and my pleasure, and my pleasure!” he added with a wave of his hand, “to follow your lordship to the place ye ken of, and do my best for you: but in the mean time I’m thinking this place suits me real well, and I will just bide here.”
<br> 
<br> “Bide here, you old Solomon!” Walter cried, between laughter and wrath; “how do you know that you are to bide anywhere, or that I mean you to stay with me at all?”
<br> 
<br> Symington waved his hand dismissing this question with the contempt it merited. “I am just a person much attached to the family,” he said, “and ye would not find it comfortable, my lord, up yonder, without me. But in the mean time ye will get a younger lad with my advice. And I’ll just bide where I am with my lady, your mother, who is a lady of great judgment. I am getting an auld man; and your lordship is a young one; and if you are over-quiet at present, which is my opinion, it is no to be expected or desired that the like of that can last. Ye will aye find me here, my lord, when you want me. It will suit me far better at my years than running to and fro upon the earth at the tail of a young lad. But as long as I can draw one foot after another, I will go with your lordship up yonder, and never fail ye,” Symington said.
