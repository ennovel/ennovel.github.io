<p>"At the beginning," replied Cyrus Harding.</p> 
<p>And in fact, the settlers were compelled to begin "at the very beginning." They did not possess even the tools necessary for making tools, and they were not even in the condition of nature, who, "having time, husbands her strength." They had no time, since they had to provide for the immediate wants of their existence, and though, profiting by acquired experience, they had nothing to invent, still they had everything to make; their iron and their steel were as yet only in the state of minerals, their earthenware in the state of clay, their linen and their clothes in the state of textile material.</p> 
<p>It must be said, however, that the settlers were "men" in the complete and higher sense of the word. The engineer Harding could not have been seconded by more intelligent companions, nor with more devotion and zeal. He had tried them. He knew their abilities.</p> 
<p>Gideon Spilett, a talented reporter, having learned everything so as to be able to speak of everything, would contribute largely with his head and hands to the colonization of the island. He would not draw back from any task: a determined sportsman, he would make a business of what till then had only been a pleasure to him.</p> 
<p>Herbert, a gallant boy, already remarkably well informed in the natural sciences, would render greater service to the common cause.</p> 
<p>Neb was devotion personified. Clever, intelligent, indefatigable, robust, with iron health, he knew a little about the work of the forge, and could not fail to be very useful in the colony.</p> 
<p>As to Pencroft, he had sailed over every sea, a carpenter in the dockyards in Brooklyn, assistant tailor in the vessels of the state, gardener, cultivator, during his holidays, etc., and like all seamen, fit for anything, he knew how to do everything.</p> 
<p>It would have been difficult to unite five men, better fitted to struggle against fate, more certain to triumph over it.</p> 
<p>"At the beginning," Cyrus Harding had said. Now this beginning of which the engineer spoke was the construction of an apparatus which would serve to transform the natural substances. The part which heat plays in these transformations is known. Now fuel, wood or coal, was ready for immediate use, an oven must be built to use it.</p> 
<p>"What is this oven for?" asked Pencroft.</p> 
<p>"To make the pottery which we have need of," replied Harding.</p> 
<p>"And of what shall we make the oven?"</p> 
<p>"With bricks."</p> 
<p>"And the bricks?"</p> 
<p>"With clay. Let us start, my friends. To save trouble, we will establish our manufactory at the place of production. Neb will bring provisions, and there will be no lack of fire to cook the food."</p> 
<p>"No," replied the reporter; "but if there is a lack of food for want of instruments for the chase?"</p> 
<p>"Ah, if we only had a knife!" cried the sailor.</p> 
<p>"Well?" asked Cyrus Harding.</p> 
<p>"Well! I would soon make a bow and arrows, and then there could be plenty of game in the larder!"</p> 
<p>"Yes, a knife, a sharp blade." said the engineer, as if he was speaking to himself.</p> 
<p>At this moment his eyes fell upon Top, who was running about on the shore. Suddenly Harding's face became animated.</p> 
<p>"Top, here," said he.</p> 
<p>The dog came at his master's call. The latter took Top's head between his hands, and unfastening the collar which the animal wore round his neck, he broke it in two, saying,--</p> 
<p>"There are two knives, Pencroft!"</p> 
<p>Two hurrahs from the sailor was the reply. Top's collar was made of a thin piece of tempered steel. They had only to sharpen it on a piece of sandstone, then to raise the edge on a finer stone. Now sandstone was abundant on the beach, and two hours after the stock of tools in the colony consisted of two sharp blades, which were easily fixed in solid handles.</p> 
<p>The production of these their first tools was hailed as a triumph. It was indeed a valuable result of their labor, and a very opportune one. They set out.</p> 
<p>Cyrus Harding proposed that they should return to the western shore of the lake, where the day before he had noticed the clayey ground of which he possessed a specimen. They therefore followed the bank of the Mercy, traversed Prospect Heights, and alter a walk of five miles or more they reached a glade, situated two hundred feet from Lake Grant.</p> 
<p>On the way Herbert had discovered a tree, the branches of which the Indians of South America employ for making their bows. It was the crejimba, of the palm family, which does not bear edible fruit. Long straight branches were cut, the leaves stripped off; it was shaped, stronger in the middle, more slender at the extremities, and nothing remained to be done but to find a plant fit to make the bow-string. This was the "hibiscus heterophyllus," which furnishes fibers of such remarkable tenacity that they have been compared to the tendons of animals. Pencroft thus obtained bows of tolerable strength, for which he only wanted arrows. These were easily made with straight stiff branches, without knots, but the points with which they must be armed, that is to say, a substance to serve in lieu of iron, could not be met with so easily. But Pencroft said, that having done his part of the work, chance would do the rest.</p> 
<p>The settlers arrived on the ground which had been discovered the day before. Being composed of the sort of clay which is used for making bricks and tiles, it was very useful for the work in question. There was no great difficulty in it. It was enough to scour the clay with sand, then to mold the bricks and bake them by the heat of a wood fire.</p> 
<p>Generally bricks are formed in molds, but the engineer contented himself with making them by hand. All that day and the day following were employed in this work. The clay, soaked in water, was mixed by the feet and hands of the manipulators, and then divided into pieces of equal size. A practiced workman can make, without a machine, about ten thousand bricks in twelve hours; but in their two days work the five brickmakers on Lincoln Island had not made more than three thousand, which were ranged near each other, until the time when their complete desiccation would permit them to be used in building the oven, that is to say, in three or four days.</p> 
<p>It was on the 2nd of April that Harding had employed himself in fixing the orientation of the island, or, in other words, the precise spot where the sun rose. The day before he had noted exactly the hour when the sun disappeared beneath the horizon, making allowance for the refraction. This morning he noted, no less exactly, the hour at which it reappeared. Between this setting and rising twelve hours, twenty-four minutes passed. Then, six hours, twelve minutes after its rising, the sun on this day would exactly pass the meridian and the point of the sky which it occupied at this moment would be the north. At the said hour, Cyrus marked this point, and putting in a line with the sun two trees which would serve him for marks, he thus obtained an invariable meridian for his ulterior operations.</p> 
<p>The settlers employed the two days before the oven was built in collecting fuel. Branches were cut all round the glade, and they picked up all the fallen wood under the trees. They were also able to hunt with greater success, since Pencroft now possessed some dozen arrows armed with sharp points. It was Top who had famished these points, by bringing in a porcupine, rather inferior eating, but of great value, thanks to the quills with which it bristled. These quills were fixed firmly at the ends of the arrows, the flight of which was made more certain by some cockatoos' feathers. The reporter and Herbert soon became very skilful archers. Game of all sorts in consequence abounded at the Chimneys, capybaras, pigeons, agouties, grouse, etc. The greater part of these animals were killed in the part of the forest on the left bank of the Mercy, to which they gave the name of Jacamar Wood, in remembrance of the bird which Pencroft and Herbert had pursued when on their first exploration.</p> 
<p>This game was eaten fresh, but they preserved some capybara hams, by smoking them above a fire of green wood, after having perfumed them with sweet-smelling leaves. However, this food, although very strengthening, was always roast upon roast, and the party would have been delighted to hear some soup bubbling on the hearth, but they must wait till a pot could be made, and, consequently, till the oven was built.</p> 
<p>During these excursions, which were not extended far from the brick- field, the hunters could discern the recent passage of animals of a large size, armed with powerful claws, but they could not recognize the species. Cyrus Harding advised them to be very careful, as the forest probably enclosed many dangerous beasts.</p> 
<p>And he did right. Indeed, Gideon Spilett and Herbert one day saw an animal which resembled a jaguar. Happily the creature did not attack them, or they might not have escaped without a severe wound. As soon as he could get a regular weapon, that is to say, one of the guns which Pencroft begged for, Gideon Spilett resolved to make desperate war against the ferocious beasts, and exterminate them from the island.</p> 
<p>The Chimneys during these few days was not made more comfortable, for the engineer hoped to discover, or build if necessary, a more convenient dwelling. They contented themselves with spreading moss and dry leaves on the sand of the passages, and on these primitive couches the tired workers slept soundly.</p> 
<p>They also reckoned the days they had passed on Lincoln Island, and from that time kept a regular account. The 5th of April, which was Wednesday, was twelve days from the time when the wind threw the castaways on this shore.</p> 
<p>On the 6th of April, at daybreak, the engineer and his companions were collected in the glade, at the place where they were going to perform the operation of baking the bricks. Naturally this had to be in the open air, and not in a kiln, or rather, the agglomeration of bricks made an enormous kiln, which would bake itself. The fuel, made of well-prepared fagots, was laid on the ground and surrounded with several rows of dried bricks, which soon formed an enormous cube, to the exterior of which they contrived air- holes. The work lasted all day, and it was not till the evening that they set fire to the fagots. No one slept that night, all watching carefully to keep up the fire.</p> 
<p>The operation lasted forty-eight hours, and succeeded perfectly. It then became necessary to leave the smoking mass to cool, and during this time Neb and Pencroft, guided by Cyrus Harding, brought, on a hurdle made of interlaced branches, loads of carbonate of lime and common stones, which were very abundant, to the north of the lake. These stones, when decomposed by heat, made a very strong quicklime, greatly increased by slacking, at least as pure as if it had been produced by the calcination of chalk or marble. Mixed with sand the lime made excellent mortar.</p> 
<p>The result of these different works was, that, on the 9th of April, the engineer had at his disposal a quantity of prepared lime and some thousands of bricks.</p> 
<p>Without losing an instant, therefore, they began the construction of a kiln to bake the pottery, which was indispensable for their domestic use. They succeeded without much difficulty. Five days after, the kiln was supplied with coal, which the engineer had discovered lying open to the sky towards the mouth of the Red Creek, and the first smoke escaped from a chimney twenty feet high. The glade was transformed into a manufactory, and Pencroft was not far wrong in believing that from this kiln would issue all the products of modern industry.</p> 
<p>In the meantime what the settlers first manufactured was a common pottery in which to cook their food. The chief material was clay, to which Harding added a little lime and quartz. This paste made regular "pipe-clay," with which they manufactured bowls, cups molded on stones of a proper size, great jars and pots to hold water, etc. The shape of these objects was clumsy and defective, but after they had been baked in a high temperature, the kitchen of the Chimneys was provided with a number of utensils, as precious to the settlers as the most beautifully enameled china. We must mention here that Pencroft, desirous to know if the clay thus prepared was worthy of its name of pipe-clay, made some large pipes, which he thought charming, but for which, alas! he had no tobacco, and that was a great privation to Pencroft. "But tobacco will come, like everything else!" he repeated, in a burst of absolute confidence.</p> 
<p>This work lasted till the 15th of April, and the time was well employed. The settlers, having become potters, made nothing but pottery. When it suited Cyrus Harding to change them into smiths, they would become smiths. But the next day being Sunday, and also Easter Sunday, all agreed to sanctify the day by rest. These Americans were religious men, scrupulous observers of the precepts of the Bible, and their situation could not but develop sentiments of confidence towards the Author of all things.</p> 
<p>On the evening of the 15th of April they returned to the Chimneys, carrying with them the pottery, the furnace being extinguished until they could put it to a new use. Their return was marked by a fortunate incident; the engineer discovered a substance which replaced tinder. It is known that a spongy, velvety flesh is procured from a certain mushroom of the genus polyporous. Properly prepared, it is extremely inflammable, especially when it has been previously saturated with gunpowder, or boiled in a solution of nitrate or chlorate of potash. But, till then, they had not found any of these polypores or even any of the morels which could replace them. On this day, the engineer, seeing a plant belonging to the wormwood genus, the principal species of which are absinthe, balm-mint, tarragon, etc., gathered several tufts, and, presenting them to the sailor, said,--</p> 
<p>"Here, Pencroft, this will please you."</p> 
<p>Pencroft looked attentively at the plant, covered with long silky hair, the leaves being clothed with soft down.</p> 
<p>"What's that, captain?" asked Pencroft. "Is it tobacco?"</p> 
<p>"No," replied Harding, "it is wormwood; Chinese wormwood to the learned, but to us it will be tinder."</p> 
<p>When the wormwood was properly dried it provided them with a very inflammable substance, especially afterwards when the engineer had impregnated it with nitrate of potash, of which the island possessed several beds, and which is in truth saltpeter.</p> 
<p>The colonists had a good supper that evening. Neb prepared some agouti soup, a smoked capybara ham, to which was added the boiled tubercules of the "caladium macrorhizum," an herbaceous plant of the arum family. They had an excellent taste, and were very nutritious, being something similar to the substance which is sold in England under the name of "Portland sago"; they were also a good substitute for bread, which the settlers in Lincoln Island did not yet possess.</p> 
<p>When supper was finished, before sleeping, Harding and his companions went to take the air on the beach. it was eight o'clock in the evening; the night was magnificent. The moon, which had been full five days before, had not yet risen, but the horizon was already silvered by those soft, pale shades which might be called the dawn of the moon. At the southern zenith glittered the circumpolar constellations, and above all the Southern Cross, which some days before the engineer had greeted on the summit of Mount Franklin.</p> 
<p>Cyrus Harding gazed for some time at this splendid constellation, which has at its summit and at its base two stars of the first magnitude, at its left arm a star of the second, and at its right arm a star of the third magnitude.</p> 
<p>Then, after some minutes thought--</p> 
<p>"Herbert," he asked of the lad, "is not this the 15th of April?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, captain," replied Herbert.</p> 
<p>"Well, if I am not mistaken, to-morrow will be one of the four days in the year in which the real time is identical with average time; that is to say, my boy, that to-morrow, to within some seconds, the sun will pass the meridian just at midday by the clocks. If the weather is fine I think that I shall obtain the longitude of the island with an approximation of some degrees."</p> 
<p>"Without instruments, without sextant?" asked Gideon Spilett.</p> 
<p>"Yes," replied the engineer. "Also, since the night is clear, I will try, this very evening, to obtain our latitude by calculating the height of the Southern Cross, that is, from the southern pole above the horizon. You understand, my friends, that before undertaking the work of installation in earnest it is not enough to have found out that this land is an island; we must, as nearly as possible, know at what distance it is situated, either from the American continent or Australia, or from the principal archipelagoes of the Pacific."</p> 
<p>"In fact," said the reporter, "instead of building a house it would be more important to build a boat, if by chance we are not more than a hundred miles from an inhabited coast."</p> 
<p>"That is why," returned Harding, "I am going to try this evening to calculate the latitude of Lincoln Island, and to-morrow, at midday, I will try to calculate the longitude."</p> 
<p>If the engineer had possessed a sextant, an apparatus with which the angular distance of objects can be measured with great precision, there would have been no difficulty in the operation. This evening by the height of the pole, the next day by the passing of the sun at the meridian, he would obtain the position of the island. But as they had not one he would have to supply the deficiency.</p> 
<p>Harding then entered the Chimneys. By the light of the fire he cut two little flat rulers, which he joined together at one end so as to form a pair of compasses, whose legs could separate or come together. The fastening was fixed with a strong acacia thorn which was found in the wood pile. This instrument finished, the engineer returned to the beach, but as it was necessary to take the height of the pole from above a clear horizon, that is, a sea horizon, and as Claw Cape hid the southern horizon, he was obliged to look for a more suitable station. The best would evidently have been the shore exposed directly to the south; but the Mercy would have to be crossed, and that was a difficulty. Harding resolved, in consequence, to make his observation from Prospect Heights, taking into consideration its height above the level of the sea--a height which he intended to calculate next day by a simple process of elementary geometry.</p> 
<p>The settlers, therefore, went to the plateau, ascending the left bank of the Mercy, and placed themselves on the edge which looked northwest and southeast, that is, above the curiously-shaped rocks which bordered the river.</p> 
<p>This part of the plateau commanded the heights of the left bank, which sloped away to the extremity of Claw Cape, and to the southern side of the island. No obstacle intercepted their gaze, which swept the horizon in a semi-circle from the cape to Reptile End. To the south the horizon, lighted by the first rays of the moon, was very clearly defined against the sky.</p> 
<p>At this moment the Southern Cross presented itself to the observer in an inverted position, the star Alpha marking its base, which is nearer to the southern pole.</p> 
<p>This constellation is not situated as near to the antarctic pole as the Polar Star is to the arctic pole. The star Alpha is about twenty-seven degrees from it, but Cyrus Harding knew this and made allowance for it in his calculation. He took care also to observe the moment when it passed the meridian below the pole, which would simplify the operation.</p> 
<p>Cyrus Harding pointed one leg of the compasses to the horizon, the other to Alpha, and the space between the two legs gave him the angular distance which separated Alpha from the horizon. In order to fix the angle obtained, he fastened with thorns the two pieces of wood on a third placed transversely, so that their separation should be properly maintained.</p> 
<p>That done, there was only the angle to calculate by bringing back the observation to the level of the sea, taking into consideration the depression of the horizon, which would necessitate measuring the height of the cliff. The value of this angle would give the height of Alpha, and consequently that of the pole above the horizon, that is to say, the latitude of the island, since the latitude of a point of the globe is always equal to the height of the pole above the horizon of this point.</p> 
<p>The calculations were left for the next day, and at ten o'clock every one was sleeping soundly.</p> 
<p>“那么，史密斯先生，我们从哪儿做起呢？”第二天早上潘克洛夫向工程师问道。</p> 
<p>“从头做起。”赛勒斯·史密斯答道。</p> 
<p>的确，居民们不得不从“第一步”做起。他们连制造工具的基本工具都没有，又不象自然界那样，“有的是时间，可以节省一些气力”。他们没有时间，因为他们必须为自己制造生活中一刻也不能缺少的必需品，虽然他们有许多前辈的经验，用不着自己摸索创造，但还是什么都需要动手去做；他们的钢和铁还在矿石状态中，陶器在陶土状态中，布匹和衣服在纺织原料的状态中。</p> 
<p>但是有一点必须说明，这些居民是“人”，而且是不折不扣的万物之灵。工程师史密斯再也找不到比这些伙伴们更聪明更热情的助手了。他了解他们，他知道谁有多大本领。</p> 
<p>吉丁·史佩莱是一个精明强干的通讯记者，为了对什么都能谈一套，因此他什么都学。开拓这个孤岛，他的头脑和双手可以发挥很大的作用。他在任何工作前面都不退缩。他是酷爱打猎的猎手，但是现在他要把一向当作消遣的事情变成自己的职业了。</p> 
<p>赫伯特是一个勇敢的孩子，他已经具备了相当丰富的自然科学常识，他可以给共同的事业带来很大的好处。</p> 
<p>纳布是热诚的化身。他聪明、机智、刚强、健壮，有着钢铁一般的体格，而且还懂得一些打铁的常识，在小队里一定有很大用处。</p> 
<p>至于潘克洛夫，他航行过各个海洋，在布罗克林的造船所里当过木匠，在这个州的船上当过助理裁缝，假期中还当过园丁、栽培匠等等。同时他也和所有的水手一样，什么都能干，而且样样都拿得起来。</p> 
<p>这五个人都很能和命运作斗争，而且很有把握取得胜利，能把这五个人凑在一起，的确是难得的。</p> 
<p>赛勒斯·史密斯已经说过了，要“从头做起”。工程师所说的这个“头”，就是要制造一种器具，用它来改变天然的物质。大家都知道，在这个过程中需要大量的热能。燃料（木柴或是煤炭）随时都有，现在必须做一只炉子。</p> 
<p>“做炉子干什么？”潘克洛夫问道。</p> 
<p>“用来烧我们所需要的陶器。”史密斯回答说。</p> 
<p>“用什么来做炉子呢？”</p> 
<p>“用砖头。”</p> 
<p>“砖头从哪儿来？”</p> 
<p>“用陶土做。我们开始吧，朋友们。为了省事起见，我们就把原料产地辟为工场，纳布管送吃的东西，那里有的是火，可以烹调。”</p> 
<p>“不，”通讯记者说，“没有打猎的武器，吃的东西就没有，那怎么办呢？”</p> 
<p>“啊，能有一把刀就好了！”水手大声说。</p> 
<p>“怎么？”赛勒斯·史密斯问道。</p> 
<p>“是啊！有了刀我马上就可以做一副弓箭。这样，伙食房里就可以有大量的野味了！”</p> 
<p>“是的，一把刀，一把快刀……”工程师自言自语地说。</p> 
<p>这时候史密斯看见托普正在岸边跑来跑去，突然他的脸上显得奕奕有神。</p> 
<p>“托普，过来！”他说。</p> 
<p>托普听见主人喊就跑过来了，史密斯用两肘夹着它的头，把它脖子上的套环解了下来，他把它折成两段，说：</p> 
<p>“这是两把刀，潘克洛夫！”</p> 
<p>水手高兴得欢呼了两声，代替回答。托普的套环是用薄薄的回火钢片做成的，只要在沙石上把它开了口，然后在较细的石头上磨快就行了。海滩上沙石很多，只用了两个钟头，他们就磨好了刀，装上了结实的刀柄，于是小队里就有两把快刀作为工具了。</p> 
<p>制成第一批工具以后，他们胜利地欢呼起来。这的确是他们宝贵的劳动成果，而且完成得非常及时。他们出发了。赛勒斯·史密斯建议还是到格兰特湖的西岸去，前一天他曾注意到那里的陶土地，还捡了一点作为标本带回来。于是他们沿着慈悲河，穿过眺望岗，走了五英里多，到达了一块林间空地，这里离格兰特湖还有二百英尺。</p> 
<p>赫伯特在路上发现了一种树木，南美洲的印地安人就是用它的树枝做弓的。这就是棕榈科的克里井巴树，这种树的果实不能吃。他们砍了一些又长又直的树枝，捋去树叶，把两头削细，使中段比较粗壮，这样就只等找一种适合的枝条做弓弦了。结果他们找到一棵木槿，它的纤维非常结实，可以和动物身上的筋腱相比。于是潘克洛夫就做成一张相当有力的弓，现在只差箭了。箭杆是很容易做的，他找了一些既硬又直、没有节的树枝就做成了。然而还缺箭头，铁的代用品却不容易找到。潘克洛夫说他已经尽了自己的力量，剩下来的只好碰机会了。</p> 
<p>居民们来到了前一天发现的地方。这里遍地都是陶土，对于制造砖瓦非常有用。这项工作并不困难，只要用沙子滤净陶土中的杂质，然后把陶土做成砖头的形状，再用柴火烧一下就行了。</p> 
<p>砖坯一般都是用模子压出来的，可是工程师只好用手来做。这件工作一共做了整整两天，工人们把陶土浸在水里，手脚并用，把陶土调和好。然后把它们分成一样大小的一块一块。一个熟练的工人不用机器，十二个钟头可以做一万块左右，可是林肯岛上的这五个制砖工人，两天所做的还不到三千块。他们把制成的砖坯一块挨一块地排在一起，等过三四天完全烧干，就可以用来砌炉子了。</p> 
<p>4月2日那天，史密斯测定了海岛的方向，也就是说，找出了日出的确实方位。前一天他就精确地记下了太阳落到水平线下面去的时间，并且把折射差也考虑在内。这天早上，他又同样精确地记录了太阳升起来的时间。从日出到日落一共是十二小时二十四分。因此在日出以后六小时十二分的时候，这一天的太阳应该正通过子午线，这时候它在天空的方位就是正北。</p> 
<p>到了上述的时间，赛勒斯就把这一点记了下来，找出和太阳连成一条直线的两棵树，这两棵树可以帮助他确定方位。他一个人默默地做好这件工作，就这样找出了当地永恒的子午线。</p> 
<p>在炉子做好以前的两天，居民们搜集了大量的燃料。他们把林间空地附近的树枝全砍了下来，还捡回了所有掉在树底下的枯枝。潘克洛夫现在有了几打带尖头的箭，打猎也比较顺利了。这些箭头是通过托普而得来的。它猎回一只豪猪来，这只豪猪肉虽然不好吃，然而它身上竖满了的硬刺却非常宝贵。把这些硬刺装在箭头上，再加上一些美冠鹦鹉的羽毛，射起来就十分准确有效了。通讯记者和赫伯特很快就成为技术娴熟的神弓手。从此“石窟”里有了各种各样的大量野味，例如：水豚、鸽子、刺鼠、松鸡等等。这些动物大部分都是从慈悲河左岸的森林地带打来的，他们把这部分森林命名为啄木鸟林，因为潘克洛夫和赫伯特第一次出来探险的时候，曾经在这里追逐过一只啄木鸟。</p> 
<p>这些野味他们大都鲜吃了，可是也留了一部分水豚腿。他们先用清香的树叶把水豚腿裹上，然后用柴火熏烤。这种食品虽然非常富有养分，但是他们今天烤，明天烤，大家都很希望火炉上能有一些熬汤的声音；这必须等到能够制造锅子的时候，也就是，必须等到炉子造好以后。</p> 
<p>这几次出猎都没有离开制砖场很远。有一次，猎人们在途中发现了大动物新近留下的足迹，这些动物脚爪很有力，但是他们认不出是哪一类野兽。赛勒斯·史密斯要大家谨慎一些，森林里大概有许多猛兽。</p> 
<p>他的指示是正确的。果然，有一天吉丁·史佩莱和赫伯特看见一只野兽，它的样子很象美洲豹。幸而它没有扑过来，要不然他们即使能够侥幸逃脱，也免不了身受重伤。吉丁·史佩莱决定一旦有了一件正式的武器——也就是潘克洛夫所要的枪——就要和这些猛兽拼命，把荒岛上的猛兽全部消灭。</p> 
<p>这几天他们并没有整修“石窟”，因为工程师希望能找到一个比较更方便的住所，必要的时候，可以自己建筑一座。他们暂时就在通道的沙地上铺了一层地苔和枯叶，没有作进一步的打算，工作累了以后，就熟睡在这些原始的床铺上。</p> 
<p>他们把在林肯岛上所度过的日子计算了一下，从那时候开始，他们就保持了每天记日志，4月5日星期三，这是风暴把遇难的人扔在海岸上以后的第十二天。</p> 
<p>4月6日，天刚破晓的时候，工程师和他的伙伴们就在林间空地上集合，打算在这里烧砖。这种工作通常不是在窑里而是在露天的地方进行的，凝结的砖坯砌成一个大窑，然后再用这个窑来烧砖坯本身。他们把捆好的木柴放在地上，把已经干了的砖坯成排地围在燃料外面，很快就围成一个立方形，在立方形的最外一层，又开了几个通气孔。这项工作整整进行了一天，直到傍晚，他们才开始在柴捆上点火。当天晚上大家都没有睡觉，全体都小心地照顾柴火，不使它熄灭。</p> 
<p>烧砖工作继续了四十八小时，结果完全成功。接着还需要等热气腾腾的半成品冷却下来，在这期间，纳布和潘克洛夫由赛勒斯·史密斯带领着到湖的北边去，把那里的石灰石和普通的石头用一个树枝编成的筐子装了一大批回来。经过加热，它们就分解成一种浓度很强的生石灰，经过沸化，生石灰的体积大大膨胀了。它们的质地非常纯粹，至少和白垩或碳酸钙烧成的一样。把石灰和细沙搅拌在一起，就成了上等的灰泥。</p> 
<p>分别做了这些准备工作，到4月9日那天，工程师就有了不少熟石灰和几千块砖头可以使用了。</p> 
<p>他们抓紧时间，立刻开始砌窑，预备焙烧他们日常生活中不可缺少的陶器。他们没有遇到多大困难就成功了，五天以后，窑里就烧起了煤——这是工程师在红河河口一带露天的地方发现的。第一缕炊烟从二十英尺高的烟囱里升了起来。林间空地变成了一个作坊，潘克洛夫甚至认为这个土窑里可以做出各种现代化的工业品来，这种想法倒也并不过分。</p> 
<p>在这期间，居民们首先制造出一只烹调用的陶土罐。主要原料是陶土，史密斯在里面加了一些石灰和石英混合起来就成了正式的“管土”。他们拿适当形状的石头作模子，用陶土做成饭碗、茶杯，另外又做了一些盛水的大壶等等。这些陶器看起来很笨重，而且很不美观，可是经过高温焙烧以后就不同了，“石窟”的厨房里添了不少器皿，居民们把它们看得和最精致的上釉瓷器一样宝贵。必须提到，潘克洛夫为了想知道这种陶土配不配称得上“管土”，就做了几只大烟斗，结果他感到非常满意，遗憾的是没有烟叶，这一点使他非常气恼。“别的东西可以找到，烟草也一定会找到的！”他信心十足地重复着。</p> 
<p>这项工作一直继续到4月15日，中间一点也没浪费时间。居民们一下子都变成陶土匠了，成天只做陶器。什么时候赛勒斯·史密斯认为应该做铁匠活了，他们就会变成铁匠。可是第二天是星期日，而且是复活节，大家都同意休假一天。</p> 
<p>4月15日傍晚，他们把陶器运到“石窟”，炉子已经熄灭了，等以后有新的用途时再烧。他们回去的时候，遇见一件值得庆幸的事；工程师发现一种可以代替火绒的东西。他从一种多孔菌科的植物上取得一种海绵状的柔软菌肉。这种菌子经过适当的加工，特别是事先使它沾上火药，或者是在硝酸盐或氯化钾的溶液里煮沸以后，非常容易燃烧。以前，他们始终没有找到这样的多孔菌，也没有找到一种可以代用的食用菌。这天工程师看见一种艾属的植物——主要品种是苦艾、薄荷、茵陈蒿等等——他采集了几把递给水手说：</p> 
<p>“拿去，潘克洛夫，这回你该高兴了。”</p> 
<p>潘克洛夫仔细看了一下，这种植物上有许多光亮的长须，叶子上满布着软毛。</p> 
<p>“这是什么，史密斯先生？”潘克洛夫问道。“是烟草吗？”</p> 
<p>“不是，”史密斯回答说，“是苦艾，学者们把它叫做中国艾，可是我们要把它当火绒用。”</p> 
<p>等苦艾干燥到相当程度以后，特别是当工程师事后把它在硝酸盐溶液里浸透了以后，它就成为一种非常容易燃烧的引火材料了。至于硝酸盐，事实上就是硝石，岛上有很多这样的矿层。</p> 
<p>这一天，移民们的晚餐非常丰盛：纳布炖了一锅刺鼠肉汤，还有一只熏水豚腿。他在熏腿上加了一些煮熟了的“贝母属”块茎，这种白星海芋属的草本植物，非常好吃，而且富于营养，有点象英国所卖的“朴德兰西米”，现在可以拿它当面包吃，因为林肯岛上的居民们，到目前为止还没有面包。</p> 
<p>吃完晚饭，在临睡以前，史密斯和他的伙伴们到海滩上去散步。这时候是晚上八点钟，夜色非常优美。这是满月以后的第五天，月亮还没有升起来，可是水平线上已经泛起了一片银白色柔和的光辉。那可以算是月亮的“曙光”。周极星在南边的天顶上闪闪发光，其中最显著的就是南十字座。几天以前，工程师曾经在富兰克林山顶上看到它。</p> 
<p>赛勒斯·史密斯对着这美丽的星座注视了很久，它的上下两端各有一颗一等星，左边有一颗二等星，右边有一颗三等星。</p> 
<p>他考虑了几分钟，然后向少年问道：</p> 
<p>“赫伯特，今天是4月15日吗？”</p> 
<p>“是的，史密斯先生。”赫伯特说。</p> 
<p>“一年之中，一共有四天实际时间和平均时间完全相等，假如我没有记错的话，明天就是其中的一天，也就是说，孩子，在明天钟刚打十二点的时候，太阳在几秒钟之内正经过子午线。如果天气好，我想大体上可以准确地算出海岛的经度来，至多也不会相差几度。”</p> 
<p>“不用仪器，不用六分仪吗？”吉丁·史佩莱问道。</p> 
<p>“不用，”工程师说。“并且，今天晚上的夜色非常清朗，我现在就要计算南十字座的高度，也就是说，根据水平线上的天极，想法子把我们的纬度求出来。要知道，朋友，在没有认真地进行确定方位的工作以前，我们还不能肯定这片陆地是一个孤岛；我们必须尽可能精确地知道它和美洲、大洋洲、或是太平洋主要群岛的距离。”</p> 
<p>“的确，”通讯记者说，“万一我们离有人居住的海岸还不到一百英里，那么造一只船就比盖一所房子更加重要了。”</p> 
<p>“所以，”史密斯说，“今天晚上我要想法子算出林肯岛的纬度来，明天中午我再想法子求经度。”</p> 
<p>于是史密斯回到“石窟”里去。他在火光下，削了两把小平板尺，把它们的一端连接起来，做成一副圆规。圆规的两只脚可以分开，也可以合在一起，连接的部分是用柴堆里找来的一枚结实的橡胶树刺钉在一起的，仪器做好了，工程师又回到海滩上去。然而天极的高度必须在没有云的水平线上测量，也就是说，要在海面上测量，而南方的水平线又被爪角挡住了，因此他只得另找一个比较合适的地点。最合乎理想的地方显然是正对着南方的海岸，但是那需要费一些事，渡过慈悲河。史密斯最后决定就在眺望岗上进行观察，他自然也考虑到高地的海拔高度——他打算第二天再用几何学的基本原理，把高地的高度求出来。</p> 
<p>于是居民们爬上慈悲河的左岸，到高地上去了。他们站在高地的边缘，也就是从西北到东南的沿河一带奇形怪状的石头上。</p> 
<p>这一带高地前面就是慈悲河左岸的山岗。这片山岗一直向着爪角的尽头和荒岛的南部低斜下去。他们一眼看过去，从爪角到爬虫角整个半圆形的水平线上都可以看得清清楚楚，没有任何东西遮挡。初升的月亮照亮了南边的水平线，在天空的衬托下，这部分水平线显得十分清晰。</p> 
<p>这时候，南十字座出现在观察家的眼前了，十字架二倒置在星座的底部，也就是离南极较近的地方。</p> 
<p>这个星座离南极比北极星离北极远。十字架二大约在距南极27度的方位，赛勒斯·史密斯知道这一点，在计算的时候就把这个角度估计在内了。当十字架二经过正对着南极的子午线时，他也仔细地进行了观察，这样工作就简单了。</p> 
<p>赛勒斯·史密斯把圆规的一只脚对着水平线，另一只脚对着十字架二，两只规脚之间的距离，就形成了十字架二和水平线之间的角距。为了把所得的这个角度固定下来，他用刺针把一根木条横钉在圆规的两只脚上，这样就可以把它们之间的角度适当地保留下来。</p> 
<p>做完了这一步工作，下一步只要计算一下角度就行了。但是首先要把水平线的俯角考虑在内，因此必须再到海平面上去进行观察，量一下峭壁的高度。有了上述的角度就可以求出十字架二的高度，从这里也可以求出天极在水平线上的高度，也就是海岛的纬度，困为地球上任何一个地方的纬度都永远等于当地天极在水平线上的高度。</p> 
<p>计算工作留在第二天进行，到十点钟的时候，大家就都睡熟了。</p>
