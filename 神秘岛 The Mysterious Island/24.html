Pencroft had kept his promise, and a light boat, the shell of which was joined together by the flexible twigs of the crejimba, had been constructed in five days. A seat in the stern, a second seat in the middle to preserve the equilibrium, a third seat in the bows, rowlocks for the two oars, a scull to steer with, completed the little craft, which was twelve feet long, and did not weigh more than two hundred pounds. The operation of launching it was extremely simple. The canoe was carried to the beach and laid on the sand before Granite House, and the rising tide floated it. Pencroft, who leaped in directly, maneuvered it with the scull and declared it to be just the thing for the purpose to which they wished to put it.</p> 
<p>"Hurrah!" cried the sailor, who did not disdain to celebrate thus his own triumph. "With this we could go round--"</p> 
<p>"The world?" asked Gideon Spilett.</p> 
<p>"No, the island. Some stones for ballast, a mast and a sail, which the captain will make for us some day, and we shall go splendidly! Well, captain--and you, Mr. Spilett; and you, Herbert; and you, Neb--aren't you coming to try our new vessel? Come along! we must see if it will carry all five of us!"</p> 
<p>This was certainly a trial which ought to be made. Pencroft soon brought the canoe to the shore by a narrow passage among the rocks, and it was agreed that they should make a trial of the boat that day by following the shore as far as the first point at which the rocks of the south ended.</p> 
<p>As they embarked, Neb cried,--</p> 
<p>"But your boat leaks rather, Pencroft."</p> 
<p>"That's nothing, Neb," replied the sailor; "the wood will get seasoned. In two days there won't be a single leak, and our boat will have no more water in her than there is in the stomach of a drunkard. Jump in!"</p> 
<p>They were soon all seated, and Pencroft shoved off. The weather was magnificent, the sea as calm as if its waters were contained within the narrow limits of a lake. Thus the boat could proceed with as much security as if it was ascending the tranquil current of the Mercy.</p> 
<p>Neb took one of the oars, Herbert the other, and Pencroft remained in the stern in order to use the scull.</p> 
<p>The sailor first crossed the channel, and steered close to the southern point of the islet. A light breeze blew from the south. No roughness was found either in the channel or the green sea. A long swell, which the canoe scarcely felt, as it was heavily laden, rolled regularly over the surface of the water. They pulled out about half a mile distant from the shore, that they might have a good view of Mount Franklin.</p> 
<p>Pencroft afterwards returned towards the mouth of the river. The boat then skirted the shore, which, extending to the extreme point, hid all Tadorn's Fens.</p> 
<p>This point, of which the distance was increased by the irregularity of the coast, was nearly three miles from the Mercy. The settlers resolved to go to its extremity, and only go beyond it as much as was necessary to take a rapid survey of the coast as far as Claw Cape.</p> 
<p>The canoe followed the windings of the shore, avoiding the rocks which fringed it, and which the rising tide began to cover. The cliff gradually sloped away from the mouth of the river to the point. This was formed of granite reeks, capriciously distributed, very different from the cliff at Prospect Heights, and of an extremely wild aspect. It might have been said that an immense cartload of rocks had been emptied out there. There was no vegetation on this sharp promontory, which projected two miles from the forest, and it thus represented a giant's arm stretched out from a leafy sleeve.</p> 
<p>The canoe, impelled by the two oars, advanced without difficulty. Gideon Spilett, pencil in one hand and notebook in the other, sketched the coast in bold strokes. Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft chatted, while examining this part of their domain, which was new to them, and, in proportion as the canoe proceeded towards the south, the two Mandible Capes appeared to move, and surround Union Bay more closely.</p> 
<p>As to Cyrus Harding, he did not speak; he simply gazed, and by the mistrust which his look expressed, it appeared that he was examining some strange country.</p> 
<p>In the meantime, after a voyage of three-quarters of an hour, the canoe reached the extremity of the point, and Pencroft was preparing to return, when Herbert, rising, pointed to a black object, saying,--</p> 
<p>"What do I see down there on the beach?"</p> 
<p>All eyes turned towards the point indicated.</p> 
<p>"Why," said the reporter, "there is something. It looks like part of a wreck half buried in the sand."</p> 
<p>"Ah!" cried Pencroft, "I see what it is!"</p> 
<p>"What?" asked Neb.</p> 
<p>"Barrels, barrels, which perhaps are full," replied the sailor.</p> 
<p>"Pull to the shore, Pencroft!" said Cyrus.</p> 
<p>A few strokes of the oar brought the canoe into a little creek, and its passengers leaped on shore.</p> 
<p>Pencroft was not mistaken. Two barrels were there, half buried in the sand, but still firmly attached to a large chest, which, sustained by them, had floated to the moment when it stranded on the beach.</p> 
<p>"There has been a wreck, then, in some part of the island," said Herbert.</p> 
<p>"Evidently," replied Spilett.</p> 
<p>"But what's in this chest?" cried Pencroft, with very natural impatience. "What's in this chest? It is shut up, and nothing to open it with! Well, perhaps a stone--"</p> 
<p>And the sailor, raising a heavy block, was about to break in one of the sides of the chest, when the engineer arrested his hand.</p> 
<p>"Pencroft," said he, "can you restrain your impatience for one hour only?"</p> 
<p>But, captain, just think! Perhaps there is everything we want in there!"</p> 
<p>"We shall find that out, Pencroft," replied the engineer; "but trust to me, and do not break the chest, which may be useful to us. We must convey it to Granite House, where we can open it easily, and without breaking it. It is quite prepared for a voyage; and since it has floated here, it may just as well float to the mouth of the river."</p> 
<p>"You are right, captain, and I was wrong, as usual," replied the sailor.</p> 
<p>The engineer's advice was good. In fact, the canoe probably would not have been able to contain the articles possibly enclosed in the chest, which doubtless was heavy, since two empty barrels were required to buoy it up. It was, therefore, much better to tow it to the beach at Granite House.</p> 
<p>And now, whence had this chest come? That was the important question. Cyrus Harding and his companions looked attentively around them, and examined the shore for several hundred steps. No other articles or pieces of wreck could be found. Herbert and Neb climbed a high rock to survey the sea, but there was nothing in sight--neither a dismasted vessel nor a ship under sail.</p> 
<p>However, there was no doubt that there had been a wreck. Perhaps this incident was connected with that of the bullet? Perhaps strangers had landed on another part of the island? Perhaps they were still there? But the thought which came naturally to the settlers was, that these strangers could not be Malay pirates, for the chest was evidently of American or European make.</p> 
<p>All the party returned to the chest, which was of an unusually large size. It was made of oak wood, very carefully closed and covered with a thick hide, which was secured by copper nails. The two great barrels, hermetically sealed, but which sounded hollow and empty, were fastened to its sides by strong ropes, knotted with a skill which Pencroft directly pronounced sailors alone could exhibit. It appeared to be in a perfect state of preservation, which was explained by the fact that it had stranded on a sandy beach, and not among rocks. They had no doubt whatever, on examining it carefully, that it had not been long in the water, and that its arrival on this coast was recent. The water did not appear to have penetrated to the inside, and the articles which it contained were no doubt uninjured.</p> 
<p>It was evident that this chest had been thrown overboard from some dismasted vessel driven towards the island, and that, in the hope that it would reach the land, where they might afterwards find it, the passengers had taken the precaution to buoy it up by means of this floating apparatus.</p> 
<p>"We will tow this chest to Granite House," said the engineer, "where we can make an inventory of its contents; then, if we discover any of the survivors from the supposed wreck, we can return it to those to whom it belongs. If we find no one--"</p> 
<p>"We will keep it for ourselves!" cried Pencroft. "But what in the world can there be in it?"</p> 
<p>The sea was already approaching the chest, and the high tide would evidently float it. One of the ropes which fastened the barrels was partly unlashed and used as a cable to unite the floating apparatus with the canoe. Pencroft and Neb then dug away the sand with their oars, so as to facilitate the moving of the chest, towing which the boat soon began to double the point, to which the name of Flotsam Point was given.</p> 
<p>The chest was heavy, and the barrels were scarcely sufficient to keep it above water. The sailor also feared every instant that it would get loose and sink to the bottom of the sea. But happily his fears were not realized, and an hour and a half after they set out--all that time had been taken up in going a distance of three miles--the boat touched the beach below Granite House.</p> 
<p>Canoe and chest were then hauled up on the sands; and as the tide was then going out, they were soon left high and dry. Neb, hurrying home, brought back some tools with which to open the chest in such a way that it might be injured as little as possible, and they proceeded to its inventory. Pencroft did not try to hide that he was greatly excited.</p> 
<p>The sailor began by detaching the two barrels, which, being in good condition, would of course be of use. Then the locks were forced with a cold chisel and hammer, and the lid thrown back. A second casing of zinc lined the interior of the chest, which had been evidently arranged that the articles which it enclosed might under any circumstances be sheltered from damp.</p> 
<p>"Oh!" cried Neb, "suppose it's jam!</p> 
<p>"I hope not," replied the reporter.</p> 
<p>"If only there was--" said the sailor in a low voice.</p> 
<p>"What?" asked Neb, who overheard him.</p> 
<p>"Nothing!"</p> 
<p>The covering of zinc was torn off and thrown back over the sides of the chest, and by degrees numerous articles of very varied character were produced and strewn about on the sand. At each new object Pencroft uttered fresh hurrahs, Herbert clapped his hands, and Neb danced up and down. There were books which made Herbert wild with joy, and cooking utensils which Neb covered with kisses!</p> 
<p>In short, the colonists had reason to be extremely satisfied, for this chest contained tools, weapons, instruments, clothes, books; and this is the exact list of them as stated in Gideon Spilett's note-book:</p> 
<p>--Tools:--3 knives with several blades, 2 woodmen's axes, 2 carpenter's hatchets, 3 planes, 2 adzes, 1 twibil or mattock, 6 chisels, 2 files, 3 hammers, 3 gimlets, 2 augers, 10 bags of nails and screws, 3 saws of different sizes, 2 boxes of needles.</p> 
<p>Weapons:--2 flint-lock guns, 2 for percussion caps, 2 breach-loader carbines, 5 boarding cutlasses, 4 sabers, 2 barrels of powder, each containing twenty-five pounds; 12 boxes of percussion caps.</p> 
<p>Instruments:--1 sextant, 1 double opera-glass, 1 telescope, 1 box of mathematical instruments, 1 mariner's compass, 1 Fahrenheit thermometer, 1 aneroid barometer, 1 box containing a photographic apparatus, object-glass, plates, chemicals, etc.</p> 
<p>Clothes:-2 dozen shirts of a peculiar material resembling wool, but evidently of a vegetable origin; 3 dozen stockings of the same material.</p> 
<p>Utensils:-1 iron pot, 6 copper saucepans, 3 iron dishes, 10 metal plates, 2 kettles, 1 portable stove, 6 table-knives,</p> 
<p>Books:-1 Bible, 1 atlas, 1 dictionary of the different Polynesian idioms, 1 dictionary of natural science, in six volumes; 3 reams of white paper, 2 books with blank pages.</p> 
<p>"It must be allowed," said the reporter, after the inventory had been made, "that the owner of this chest was a practical man! Tools, weapons, instruments, clothes, utensils, books--nothing is wanting! It might really be said that he expected to be wrecked, and had prepared for it beforehand."</p> 
<p>"Nothing is wanting, indeed," murmured Cyrus Harding thoughtfully.</p> 
<p>"And for a certainty," added Herbert, "the vessel which carried this chest and its owner was not a Malay pirate!"</p> 
<p>"Unless," said Pencroft, "the owner had been taken prisoner by pirates--"</p> 
<p>"That is not admissible," replied the reporter. "It is more probable that an American or European vessel has been driven into this quarter, and that her passengers, wishing to save necessaries at least, prepared this chest and threw it overboard."</p> 
<p>"Is that your opinion, captain?" asked Herbert.</p> 
<p>"Yes, my boy," replied the engineer, "that may have been the case. It is possible that at the moment, or in expectation of a wreck, they collected into this chest different articles of the greatest use in hopes of finding it again on the coast--"</p> 
<p>"Even the photographic box!" exclaimed the sailor incredulously.</p> 
<p>"As to that apparatus," replied Harding, "I do not quite see the use of it; and a more complete supply of clothes or more abundant ammunition would have been more valuable to us as well as to any other castaways!"</p> 
<p>"But isn't there any mark or direction on these instruments, tools, or books, which would tell us something about them?" asked Gideon Spilett.</p> 
<p>That might be ascertained. Each article was carefully examined, especially the books, instruments and weapons. Neither the weapons nor the instruments, contrary to the usual custom, bore the name of the maker; they were, besides, in a perfect state, and did not appear to have been used. The same peculiarity marked the tools and utensils; all were new, which proved that the articles had not been taken by chance and thrown into the chest, but, on the contrary, that the choice of things had been well considered and arranged with care. This was also indicated by the second case of metal which had preserved them from damp, and which could not have been soldered in a moment of haste.</p> 
<p>As to the dictionaries of natural science and Polynesian idioms, both were English; but they neither bore the name of the publisher nor the date of publication.</p> 
<p>The same with the Bible printed in English, in quarto, remarkable from a typographic point of view, and which appeared to have been often used.</p> 
<p>The atlas was a magnificent work, comprising maps of every country in the world, and several planispheres arranged upon Mercator's projection, and of which the nomenclature was in French--but which also bore neither date nor name of publisher.</p> 
<p>There was nothing, therefore, on these different articles by which they could be traced, and nothing consequently of a nature to show the nationality of the vessel which must have recently passed these shores.</p> 
<p>But, wherever the chest might have come from, it was a treasure to the settlers on Lincoln Island. Till then, by making use of the productions of nature, they had created everything for themselves, and, thanks to their intelligence, they had managed without difficulty. But did it not appear as if Providence had wished to reward them by sending them these productions of human industry? Their thanks rose unanimously to Heaven.</p> 
<p>However, one of them was not quite satisfied: it was Pencroft. It appeared that the chest did not contain something which he evidently held in great esteem, for in proportion as they approached the bottom of the box, his hurrahs diminished in heartiness, and, the inventory finished, he was heard to mutter these words:--"That's all very fine, but you can see that there is nothing for me in that box!"</p> 
<p>This led Neb to say,--</p> 
<p>"Why, friend Pencroft, what more do you expect?"</p> 
<p>"Half a pound of tobacco," replied Pencroft seriously, "and nothing would have been wanting to complete my happiness!"</p> 
<p>No one could help laughing at this speech of the sailor's.</p> 
<p>But the result of this discovery of the chest was, that it was now more than ever necessary to explore the island thoroughly. It was therefore agreed that the next morning at break of day, they should set out, by ascending the Mercy so as to reach the western shore. If any castaways had landed on the coast, it was to be feared they were without resources, and it was therefore the more necessary to carry help to them without delay.</p> 
<p>During the day the different articles were carried to Granite House, where they were methodically arranged in the great hall. This day--the 29th of October--happened to be a Sunday, and, before going to bed, Herbert asked the engineer if he would not read them something from the Gospel.</p> 
<p>"Willingly," replied Cyrus Harding.</p> 
<p>He took the sacred volume, and was about to open it, when Pencroft stopped him, saying,--"Captain, I am superstitious. Open at random and read the first verse which, your eye falls upon. We will see if it applies to our situation."</p> 
<p>Cyrus Harding smiled at the sailor's idea, and, yielding to his wish, he opened exactly at a place where the leaves were separated by a marker.</p> 
<p>Immediately his eyes were attracted by a cross which, made with a pencil, was placed against the eighth verse of the seventh chapter of the Gospel of St. Matthew. He read the verse, which was this:--</p> 
<p>"For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth."</p> 
<p>10月29日，树皮平底船完工了。潘克洛夫按照自己的保证，在五天之内，造成一艘轻舟，船身是用“克来金巴”树的柔韧细枝编成的。这只小船共有三个座位，一个在船尾，一个在中间，用来保持船身的平衡，一个在船头。此外还有两个桨架和一个掌握方向的尾橹。全长十二英尺，重量不到二百斤。</p> 
<p>想让它下水是极其简单的。平底船被带到海滨来，放在“花岗石宫”前面的沙滩上，潮水一涨，它就浮起来了。潘克洛夫马上跳上船去一面摇起橹来，一面夸奖这只船，说对大家再适合也没有了。</p> 
<p>“哈哈！”水手喊道，他不能不为自己的胜利而感到高兴。“我们可以用它周游……”</p> 
<p>“全世界？”吉丁·史佩莱问道。</p> 
<p>“不，全海岛。再找一些压仓的石头。竖一根桅杆，过几天史密斯先生再给我们做一面帆，我们就可以耀武扬威地出航了！史密斯先生，还有你，史佩莱先生，还有你，赫伯特，还有你，纳布，你们要来试试我们的新船吗？来呀！看看它能不能把我们五个人都载起来！”</p> 
<p>这的确有一试的必要。潘克洛夫马上通过一条岩石间的水道，把平底船摇到岸边来。他们商量妥，当天沿着海岸一直划到第一个海角，也就是南部岩石的尽头，作一次试航。</p> 
<p>他们上船时，纳布喊道：</p> 
<p>“你的船有点漏水呢，潘克洛夫。”</p> 
<p>“不要紧，纳布，”水手答道；“木头自己就会密合的。两天之内，连一条缝都不会有，那时候，我们船里的水就要比醉鬼胃里的水还要少了。跳进来！”</p> 
<p>他们马上都坐下来，潘克洛夫荡开了桨。天气很好，海面上风平浪静，简直和湖水一样。因此航行中非常安全，好象在平静的慈悲河上逆流而上似的。</p> 
<p>纳布掌着一支桨，赫伯特掌着另外一支，潘克洛夫坐在船尾摇橹。</p> 
<p>水手首先穿过海峡，把船摇到小岛的南端。一阵微风从南面吹来。不论在海峡里还是在碧绿的大海上，都没有翻腾的巨浪。海面上滚动着长长波条，但是由于船载很重，船上的人几乎没有丝毫感觉。他们划到离岸约有一英里半的地方，打算好好地看一下富兰克林山。</p> 
<p>看完以后，潘克洛夫又回到河口。平底船接着就沿岸航行，海岸一直伸向尽头的海角，把整个的潦凫沼地都遮住了</p> 
<p>这个海角离慈悲河将近三英里，由于海岸线十分曲折，因此距离才有这么远，他们决定划到尽头去，必要的时候，还要更远一些，以便大概地观察一下直到爪角一带的海滨。</p> 
<p>平底船绕过潮水开始淹没的礁石，沿着曲折的海岸航行。峭壁由河口逐渐向海角倾斜下来。它是由花岗石形成的，东一堆西一堆零乱地散布着，和眺望岗的峭壁完全不同，而且看起来非常荒凉，好象曾有人在这里开采过大量山石似的。从森林里向外突出的这段长达二英里的陡峭的海角，没有任何植物，看起来好象一只从枝叶茂密的衣袖里伸出来的巨大手臂。</p> 
<p>平底船在双桨的推动下，顺利地前进着。吉丁·史佩莱一手握着铅笔，一手拿着笔记本，把海岸的轮廓鲜明地画了下来。纳布、赫伯特和潘克洛夫一面聊天，一面观察他们的这部分新领土；随着平底船向南前进，颚骨角的南北两个部分也好象移动起来，把联合湾包围得更紧了。</p> 
<p>赛勒斯·史密斯一句话也不说，他只是凝神看着，他的目光有些疑虑，好象在观察一个陌生的地方。</p> 
<p>平底船前进了三刻钟以后，到达了海角的顶点。潘克洛夫正打算掉转船头，赫伯特突然站起身来，指着一件黑色的东西说：</p> 
<p>“那边海岸上有个什么东西？”</p> 
<p>大家都朝着他所指的方向看去。</p> 
<p>“怎么，”通讯记者说，“的确有东西。象是一只破船的残骸，一半陷在泥沙里。”</p> 
<p>“啊！”潘克洛夫喊道，“我明白了！”</p> 
<p>“什么？”纳布问道。</p> 
<p>“木桶，木桶，也许还满装着东西呢。”水手回答说。</p> 
<p>“靠岸，潘克洛夫！”赛勒斯说。</p> 
<p>他们划了几桨，平底船就进入一条小河，船上的人跳上岸去。</p> 
<p>潘克洛夫没有猜错。那儿有两只木桶，半埋在沙里，可是，还紧紧地绑着一只大箱子。这只箱子由木桶浮力支持着，起初在水面飘浮，后来就搁在海滩上了。</p> 
<p>“那么，在荒岛上有过遇难的船了。”赫伯特说。</p> 
<p>“很明显。”史佩莱答道。</p> 
<p>“可是箱子里是什么？”潘克洛夫忍不住问道。“箱子里是什么？锁着呢，没关系，把它砸开！好吧，用石头……”</p> 
<p>水手举起一块沉重的石头，正打算把箱子的一面砸破，可是工程师抓住了他的手。</p> 
<p>“潘克洛夫，”他说，“你能再忍耐一个钟头吗？”</p> 
<p>“史密斯先生，你想，也许这里面有我们所需要的东西呢！”</p> 
<p>“我们会拿出来的，潘克洛夫，”工程师说，“可是交给我，不要把箱子毁了，我们可能用得着它。我们应该把它带回‘花岗石宫’去，到了那儿不必打坏，很容易就可以打开了。这个箱子带起来也不费事，既然它已经漂到这儿来，不妨再让它漂到河口去。”</p> 
<p>“说得对，史密斯先生，我又错了，不过人有时总不能克制自己。”水手说。</p> 
<p>工程师的意见很正确。的确，这只箱子既然需要两只空桶把它浮起来，无疑是很沉重的，把箱子里所盛的东西全装到平底船上去恐怕会载不动。因此，最好还是在水面上把它拉到“花岗石宫”前面的海滩去。</p> 
<p>这只箱子是从哪里来的呢？这是一个重要的问题。赛勒斯·史密斯和他的伙伴们留神地察看了一下周围，又视察了一下几百步以外的海岸，再也找不到难船的其他遗物了。赫伯特和纳布爬上一块高耸的山石去俯瞰大海，也没有瞧见什么——既没有折断桅杆的孤舟，也没有扬帆行驶的船只。</p> 
<p>可是曾经有船遇险这一点是肯定的了。也许这也和枪弹事件有关吧？也许有一些人在荒岛的其他地方登了陆。也许他们还在这儿。他们都自然而然地想到一点，那就是：这些陌生人不可能是海盗，因为这只箱子一看就知道是欧美制造的。</p> 
<p>大家都围拢到这只大得出奇的箱子旁边来。箱子是橡木的，关得很严，外面包着一张很厚的兽皮，用铜钉子钉在上面。两只巨大的木桶密封着，敲上去发出空洞的声音。这两只木桶被绳子牢牢地缚在箱子的两边，绳结非常巧妙，潘克洛夫一看见就说，只有水手才系得出这样的结来；箱子看起来丝毫没有损坏，只要看它搁在沙滩上，而不是撞在乱石堆中，就足以说明这一点了。经过仔细观察以后，他们都一致肯定：箱子在水里的时间还不久，甚至是最近才上岸的。海水好象还没有透到里面去，箱内的东西自然还没有损坏。</p> 
<p>显然，有一只折断桅杆的船在荒岛附近漂浮时，把这只箱子扔了出来，船上的人希望箱子能到达陆地，以便事后找回来，因此才用这一套办法小心地把它浮起来的。</p> 
<p>“我们把箱子从水上拖回‘花岗石宫’去，”工程师说，“到了那儿我们就可以清点一下里面的东西了。以后，要是找到在假设的遇难中逃出性命的人，我们就把箱子还给他们。要是找不着……”</p> 
<p>“就算是我们的了！”潘克洛夫大声说。“可是，里面究竟有些什么呢！”</p> 
<p>海水已经迫近箱子，上涨的海潮显然就要把它浮起来了。他们解开一根绳子把这套漂浮的设备拴在平底船的后边。然后潘克洛夫和纳布就用他们的桨挖开泥沙，使箱子移动起来更方便些，平底船拖着箱子，马上就绕过了遗物角——这个因遗留箱子而得名的地方。</p> 
<p>箱子很重，空桶勉强把它维持在水面上。水手时刻都担心箱子会脱扣而沉到海底去，幸亏他的顾虑没有成为事实。他们启程以后一个半小时——这个时间内航行了三英里——就在“花岗石宫”下面靠岸了。</p> 
<p>于是，他们把平底船和箱子都拖上沙滩。这时候正赶上退潮，他们很快就高居在没有水的海滩上了。纳布急忙跑回家去，拿来几件应用的工具，好使箱子打开而一点不受损伤，然后他们就准备清点东西。潘克洛夫显得兴高采烈。</p> 
<p>水手开始动手把两个木桶卸下来，木桶很完整，还可以用。随后他用凿子和锤子去打锁。盖子打开了。箱子的内壁衬着一层锌皮，这显然是为了防止箱中的物件受潮。</p> 
<p>“啊！”纳布大声喊道，“也许是罐头！”</p> 
<p>“但愿不是。”通讯记者说。</p> 
<p>“假如是……”水手低声说。</p> 
<p>“什么？”纳布无意中听见了，问道。</p> 
<p>“没有什么！”</p> 
<p>水手扯开锌皮，把它扔在箱子上，然后就把各种各样的东西逐件拿出来，放在沙滩上。每拿出一样新的东西，潘克洛夫都要欢呼几声，赫伯特拍着手，纳布在一旁手舞足蹈——象黑人跳舞似的。赫伯特发现有书，不禁喜出望外；纳布拿着烹调器具不住接吻。</p> 
<p>总之，他们感到心满意足是理所当然的，因为箱子里工具、武器、仪器、衣服、书籍都有；下面就是一张吉丁·史佩莱记在笔记本上的一张全部物品的清单：</p> 
<p>工具——三把多开的小刀，两把砍柴斧，两把木工斧，三个刨子，两个锛子，一把鹤嘴锄，六把凿子，两把锉，三把锤子，三把螺丝起，两把钻孔锥，十袋洋钉和螺丝钉，三把大小不同的锯子，二十二匣针。</p> 
<p>武器——两支燧发枪，两支撞针枪，两支后膛马枪，五把尖刀，四把马刀，两桶火药（每桶二十五斤），十二箱雷管。</p> 
<p>仪器——一个六分仪，一副双筒望远镜，一架长筒望远镜，一匣绘图仪器，一个航海指南针，一只华氏寒暑表，一只无液晴雨表，一只装有照相器材、对物透镜、感光板、药品等的匣子。</p> 
<p>衣服——两打衬衫（由一种类似羊毛的织物制成，但显然是植物纤维），三打长袜（也是同样的质料）。</p> 
<p>器皿——一只铁汤罐，六把带柄小铜锅，三只铁盘，十只钢精羹匙和十只钢精叉子，两把水壶，一个轻便火炉，六把餐刀。</p> 
<p>书籍——一本《圣经》（《新旧约全书》），一本地图，一本《玻里尼西亚成语辞典》，一部《自然科学辞典》（共包括六本），三令白纸，两本白纸簿子。</p> 
<p>“必须承认，”通讯记者在清点完毕以后说，“这个箱子的主人是一个经验丰富的人！工具、武器、仪器、衣服、器皿、书籍……什么都有了！他简直是料到要遇险，困此事先做好了准备。”</p> 
<p>“真是什么都有。”赛勒斯·史密斯若有所思地说。</p> 
<p>“可以肯定，”赫伯特补充道，“这只箱子和它主人的船不是海盗的！”</p> 
<p>潘克洛夫说：“除非箱子的主人被海盗俘虏了……”</p> 
<p>“这是不可能的，”通讯记者答道。“大概是一只欧美的船只被风暴吹到这里来，乘客们打算最低限度把必需品保留下来，因此才准备了这个箱子，把它扔在海里的。”</p> 
<p>“你同意这样的看法吗，史密斯先生？”赫伯特说。</p> 
<p>“是的，孩子，”工程师答道，“大概是这样。遇险的时候，或者是知道要遇险的时候，他们可能把各种最有用的东西都收集在一起，放在箱子里，希望事后再在海岸上找到它……”</p> 
<p>“难道连照相器材的匣子都要收起来？”水手怀疑地喊道。</p> 
<p>“至于照相器材，”史密斯答道，“我还不太明白留着干什么，要是多放一些衣服或是火药对我们以及任何遇难人都要宝贵得多！”</p> 
<p>“这些仪器、工具和书籍上有没有记号和线索可以知道它们的来历呢？”吉丁·史佩莱问道。</p> 
<p>这是可以证实的。所有的东西，特别是书籍、用具和武器，都经过仔细的检查。可是这些武器和仪器都跟一般的不同，没有制造厂的牌号。而且，它们简直跟新的一样，看来好象根本没有用过，工具和器皿也有着同样的特点；一切都是新的。这一点说明这些东西不是随便扔到箱子里，相反，是经过慎重考虑，挑选出来的。此外，还有一件事也足以说明这一点，那就是：这些东西有锌皮保护着防潮，如果在慌忙之中，进行金属焊接是不可能的。</p> 
<p>《自然科学辞典》和《玻里尼西亚成语辞典》都是英文的，可是上面既没有出版者的名字，又没有出版日期。</p> 
<p>那本四开本的英文《圣经》也是一样，它印刷得非常特殊，而且一看就知道是经常使用的。</p> 
<p>那本地图是一件非常精致的作品，它包括世界各国的分图和几幅根据墨卡托投影法制成的地球平面图，专门术语都是法文的——可是也没有出版日期和出版者的名字。</p> 
<p>因此，在这许多不同的东西上，他们发现不出丝毫线索。这艘船最近曾在附近沿海航行过，这是可以肯定的，但要想进一步知道它属于哪一国，却没有任何东西可以说明。</p> 
<p>不管这只箱子是从哪儿来的，它毕竟是使林肯岛上的居民增加了财富。在这以前，他们已经利用自然产物，给自己创造了一切，同时由于他们的智慧，使他们战胜了困难。可是，现在凭空有了这些工业品，好象是上苍有意报偿他们似的，因此他们都一致感谢上苍。</p> 
<p>他们之间有一个人却还不满足，那就是潘克洛夫。箱子里好象还少一样他特别重视的东西；当他们翻到箱底的时候，他的欢呼也就渐渐地不如原先热烈了，清点完毕以后，只听见他喃喃地说：</p> 
<p>“都不错，可是你们瞧，箱子里却没有我想要的东西！”</p> 
<p>纳布听了以后说：</p> 
<p>“怎么，潘克洛夫，你还想要什么？”</p> 
<p>“半斤烟草，”潘克洛夫严肃地答道，“有了这个我就完全满足了！”</p> 
<p>听了水手的话以后，谁都忍不住笑出声来。</p> 
<p>发现了箱子，大家感觉到现在更有必要彻底搜查全岛了。他们一致同意第二天早上天一亮就出发，沿着慈悲河向上游航行，直到西海岸。应该考虑到，假如有遇难的人上陆，他们可能没有生活资料，因此必须毫不迟延地去帮助他们。</p> 
<p>天黑以前，他们把各种物品都搬进了“花岗石宫”，井井有条地放在大厅里。</p> 
<p>10月29日这一天是星期日，在临睡以前，赫伯特要求工程师给大家念一段福音。</p> 
<p>“好。”赛勒斯·史密斯回答说。</p> 
<p>他拿起《圣经》，正打算翻开，潘克洛夫拦住他说：</p> 
<p>“史密斯先生，我有些迷信，你随便翻开一页，把首先看见的那一行念出来，看看和我们的遭遇是不是相合。”</p> 
<p>赛勒斯·史密斯听了水手的话以后，微微一笑，他果然按照水手的意思随手一翻，恰好这一页夹着一个书签。</p> 
<p>他马上注意到，在《马太福音》第七章第八节的附近有一个铅笔画的红十字。他把那一行念了出来：</p> 
<p>“凡祈求的，就得着。寻找的，就寻见。”</p>
