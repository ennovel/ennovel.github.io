The engineer merely told his companions that the land upon which fate had thrown them was an island, and that the next day they would consult. Then each settled himself as well as he could to sleep, and in that rocky hole, at a height of two thousand five hundred feet above the level of the sea, through a peaceful night, the islanders enjoyed profound repose.</p> 
<p>The next day, the 30th of March, after a hasty breakfast, which consisted solely of the roasted tragopan, the engineer wished to climb again to the summit of the volcano, so as more attentively to survey the island upon which he and his companions were imprisoned for life perhaps, should the island be situated at a great distance from any land, or if it was out of the course of vessels which visited the archipelagoes of the Pacific Ocean. This time his companions followed him in the new exploration. They also wished to see the island, on the productions of which they must depend for the supply of all their wants.</p> 
<p>It was about seven o'clock in the morning when Cyrus Harding, Herbert, Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Neb quitted the encampment. No one appeared to be anxious about their situation. They had faith in themselves, doubtless, but it must be observed that the basis of this faith was not the same with Harding as with his companions. The engineer had confidence, because he felt capable of extorting from this wild country everything necessary for the life of himself and his companions; the latter feared nothing, just because Cyrus Harding was with them. Pencroft especially, since the incident of the relighted fire, would not have despaired for an instant, even if he was on a bare rock, if the engineer was with him on the rock.</p> 
<p>"Pshaw," said he, "we left Richmond without permission from the authorities! It will be hard if we don't manage to get away some day or other from a place where certainly no one will detain us!"</p> 
<p>Cyrus Harding followed the same road as the evening before. They went round the cone by the plateau which formed the shoulder, to the mouth of the enormous chasm. The weather was magnificent. The sun rose in a pure sky and flooded with his rays all the eastern side of the mountain.</p> 
<p>The crater was reached. It was just what the engineer had made it out to be in the dark; that is to say, a vast funnel which extended, widening, to a height of a thousand feet above the plateau. Below the chasm, large thick streaks of lava wound over the sides of the mountain, and thus marked the course of the eruptive matter to the lower valleys which furrowed the northern part of the island.</p> 
<p>The interior of the crater, whose inclination did not exceed thirty five to forty degrees, presented no difficulties nor obstacles to the ascent. Traces of very ancient lava were noticed, which probably had overflowed the summit of the cone, before this lateral chasm had opened a new way to it.</p> 
<p>As to the volcanic chimney which established a communication between the subterranean layers and the crater, its depth could not be calculated with the eye, for it was lost in obscurity. But there was no doubt as to the complete extinction of the volcano.</p> 
<p>Before eight o'clock Harding and his companions were assembled at the summit of the crater, on a conical mound which swelled the northern edge.</p> 
<p>"The sea, the sea everywhere!" they cried, as if their lips could not restrain the words which made islanders of them.</p> 
<p>The sea, indeed, formed an immense circular sheet of water all around them! Perhaps, on climbing again to the summit of the cone, Cyrus Harding had had a hope of discovering some coast, some island shore, which he had not been able to perceive in the dark the evening before. But nothing appeared on the farthest verge of the horizon, that is to say over a radius of more than fifty miles. No land in sight. Not a sail. Over all this immense space the ocean alone was visible--the island occupied the center of a circumference which appeared to be infinite.</p> 
<p>The engineer and his companions, mute and motionless, surveyed for some minutes every point of the ocean, examining it to its most extreme limits. Even Pencroft, who possessed a marvelous power of sight, saw nothing; and certainly if there had been land at the horizon, if it appeared only as an indistinct vapor, the sailor would undoubtedly have found it out, for nature had placed regular telescopes under his eyebrows.</p> 
<p>From the ocean their gaze returned to the island which they commanded entirely, and the first question was put by Gideon Spilett in these terms:</p> 
<p>"About what size is this island?"</p> 
<p>Truly, it did not appear large in the midst of the immense ocean.</p> 
<p>Cyrus Harding reflected a few minutes; he attentively observed the perimeter of the island, taking into consideration the height at which he was placed; then,--</p> 
<p>"My friends," said he, "I do not think I am mistaken in giving to the shore of the island a circumference of more than a hundred miles."</p> 
<p>"And consequently an area?"</p> 
<p>"That is difficult to estimate," replied the engineer, "for it is so uneven."</p> 
<p>If Cyrus Harding was not mistaken in his calculation, the island had almost the extent of Malta or Zante, in the Mediterranean, but it was at the same time much more irregular and less rich in capes, promontories, points, bays, or creeks. Its strange form caught the eye, and when Gideon Spilett, on the engineer's advice, had drawn the outline, they found that it resembled some fantastic animal, a monstrous leviathan, which lay sleeping on the surface of the Pacific.</p> 
<p>This was in fact the exact shape of the island, which it is of consequence to know, and a tolerably correct map of it was immediately drawn by the reporter.</p> 
<p>The east part of the shore, where the castaways had landed, formed a wide bay, terminated by a sharp cape, which had been concealed by a high point from Pencroft on his first exploration. At the northeast two other capes closed the bay, and between them ran a narrow gulf, which looked like the half-open jaws of a formidable dog-fish.</p> 
<p>From the northeast to the southwest the coast was rounded, like the flattened cranium of an animal, rising again, forming a sort of protuberance which did not give any particular shape to this part of the island, of which the center was occupied by the volcano.</p> 
<p>From this point the shore ran pretty regularly north and south, broken at two-thirds of its perimeter by a narrow creek, from which it ended in a long tail, similar to the caudal appendage of a gigantic alligator.</p> 
<p>This tail formed a regular peninsula, which stretched more than thirty miles into the sea, reckoning from the cape southeast of the island, already mentioned; it curled round, making an open roadstead, which marked out the lower shore of this strangely-formed land.</p> 
<p>At the narrowest part, that is to say between the Chimneys and the creek on the western shore, which corresponded to it in latitude, the island only measured ten miles; but its greatest length, from the jaws at the northeast to the extremity of the tail of the southwest, was not less than thirty miles.</p> 
<p>As to the interior of the island, its general aspect was this, very woody throughout the southern part from the mountain to the shore, and arid and sandy in the northern part. Between the volcano and the east coast Cyrus Harding and his companions were surprised to see a lake, bordered with green trees, the existence of which they had not suspected. Seen from this height, the lake appeared to be on the same level as the ocean, but, on reflection, the engineer explained to his companions that the altitude of this little sheet of water must be about three hundred feet, because the plateau, which was its basin, was but a prolongation of the coast.</p> 
<p>"Is it a freshwater lake?" asked Pencroft.</p> 
<p>"Certainly," replied the engineer, "for it must be fed by the water which flows from the mountain."</p> 
<p>"I see a little river which runs into it," said Herbert, pointing out a narrow stream, which evidently took its source somewhere in the west.</p> 
<p>"Yes," said Harding; "and since this stream feeds the lake, most probably on the side near the sea there is an outlet by which the surplus water escapes. We shall see that on our return."</p> 
<p>This little winding watercourse and the river already mentioned constituted the water-system, at least such as it was displayed to the eyes of the explorers. However, it was possible that under the masses of trees which covered two-thirds of the island, forming an immense forest, other rivers ran towards the sea. It might even be inferred that such was the case, so rich did this region appear in the most magnificent specimens of the flora of the temperate zones. There was no indication of running water in the north, though perhaps there might be stagnant water among the marshes in the northeast; but that was all, in addition to the downs, sand, and aridity which contrasted so strongly with the luxuriant vegetation of the rest of the island.</p> 
<p>The volcano did not occupy the central part; it rose, on the contrary, in the northwestern region, and seemed to mark the boundary of the two zones. At the southwest, at the south, and the southeast, the first part of the spurs were hidden under masses of verdure. At the north, on the contrary, one could follow their ramifications, which died away on the sandy plains. It was on this side that, at the time when the mountain was in a state of eruption, the discharge had worn away a passage, and a large heap of lava had spread to the narrow jaw which formed the northeastern gulf.</p> 
<p>Cyrus Harding and his companions remained an hour at the top of the mountain. The island was displayed under their eyes, like a plan in relief with different tints, green for the forests, yellow for the sand, blue for the water. They viewed it in its tout-ensemble, nothing remained concealed but the ground hidden by verdure, the hollows of the valleys, and the interior of the volcanic chasms.</p> 
<p>One important question remained to be solved, and the answer would have a great effect upon the future of the castaways.</p> 
<p>Was the island inhabited?</p> 
<p>It was the reporter who put this question, to which after the close examination they had just made, the answer seemed to be in the negative.</p> 
<p>Nowhere could the work of a human hand be perceived. Not a group of huts, not a solitary cabin, not a fishery on the shore. No smoke curling in the air betrayed the presence of man. It is true, a distance of nearly thirty miles separated the observers from the extreme points, that is, of the tail which extended to the southwest, and it would have been difficult, even to Pencroft's eyes, to discover a habitation there. Neither could the curtain of verdure, which covered three-quarters of the island, be raised to see if it did not shelter some straggling village. But in general the islanders live on the shores of the narrow spaces which emerge above the waters of the Pacific, and this shore appeared to be an absolute desert.</p> 
<p>Until a more complete exploration, it might be admitted that the island was uninhabited. But was it frequented, at least occasionally, by the natives of neighboring islands? It was difficult to reply to this question. No land appeared within a radius of fifty miles. But fifty miles could be easily crossed, either by Malay proas or by the large Polynesian canoes. Everything depended on the position of the island, of its isolation in the Pacific, or of its proximity to archipelagoes. Would Cyrus Harding be able to find out their latitude and longitude without instruments? It would be difficult. Since he was in doubt, it was best to take precautions against a possible descent of neighboring natives.</p> 
<p>The exploration of the island was finished, its shape determined, its features made out, its extent calculated, the water and mountain systems ascertained. The disposition of the forests and plains had been marked in a general way on the reporter's plan. They had now only to descend the mountain slopes again, and explore the soil, in the triple point of view, of its mineral, vegetable, and animal resources.</p> 
<p>But before giving his companions the signal for departure, Cyrus Harding said to them in a calm, grave voice,--</p> 
<p>Here, my friends, is the small corner of land upon which the hand of the Almighty has thrown us. We are going to live here; a long time, perhaps. Perhaps, too, unexpected help will arrive, if some ship passes by chance. I say by chance, because this is an unimportant island; there is not even a port in which ships could anchor, and it is to be feared that it is situated out of the route usually followed, that is to say, too much to the south for the ships which frequent the archipelagoes of the Pacific, and too much to the north for those which go to Australia by doubling Cape Horn. I wish to hide nothing of our position from you--"</p> 
<p>"And you are right, my dear Cyrus," replied the reporter, with animation. "You have to deal with men. They have confidence in you, and you can depend upon them. Is it not so, my friends?"</p> 
<p>"I will obey you in everything, captain," said Herbert, seizing the engineer's hand.</p> 
<p>"My master always, and everywhere!" cried Neb.</p> 
<p>"As for me," said the sailor, "if I ever grumble at work, my name's not Jack Pencroft, and if you like, captain, we will make a little America of this island! We will build towns, we will establish railways, start telegraphs, and one fine day, when it is quite changed, quite put in order and quite civilized, we will go and offer it to the government of the Union. Only, I ask one thing."</p> 
<p>"What is that?" said the reporter.</p> 
<p>"It is, that we do not consider ourselves castaways, but colonists, who have come here to settle." Harding could not help smiling, and the sailor's idea was adopted. He then thanked his companions, and added, that he would rely on their energy and on the aid of Heaven.</p> 
<p>"Well, now let us set off to the Chimneys!" cried Pencroft.</p> 
<p>"One minute, my friends," said the engineer. "It seems to me it would be a good thing to give a name to this island, as well as to, the capes, promontories, and watercourses, which we can see.</p> 
<p>"Very good," said the reporter. "In the future, that will simplify the instructions which we shall have to give and follow."</p> 
<p>"Indeed," said the sailor, "already it is something to be able to say where one is going, and where one has come from. At least, it looks like somewhere."</p> 
<p>"The Chimneys, for example," said Herbert.</p> 
<p>"Exactly!" replied Pencroft. "That name was the most convenient, and it came to me quite of myself. Shall we keep the name of the Chimneys for our first encampment, captain?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, Pencroft, since you have so christened it."</p> 
<p>"Good! as for the others, that will be easy," returned the sailor, who was in high spirits. "Let us give them names, as the Robinsons did, whose story Herbert has often read to me; Providence Bay, Whale Point, Cape Disappointment!"</p> 
<p>"Or, rather, the names of Captain Harding," said Herbert, "of Mr. Spilett, of Neb!--"</p> 
<p>"My name!" cried Neb, showing his sparkling white teeth.</p> 
<p>"Why not?" replied Pencroft. "Port Neb, that would do very well! And Cape Gideon--"</p> 
<p>"I should prefer borrowing names from our country," said the reporter, "which would remind us of America."</p> 
<p>"Yes, for the principal ones," then said Cyrus Harding; "for those of the bays and seas, I admit it willingly. We might give to that vast bay on the east the name of Union Bay, for example; to that large hollow on the south, Washington Bay; to the mountain upon which we are standing, that of Mount Franklin; to that lake which is extended under our eyes, that of Lake Grant; nothing could be better, my friends. These names will recall our country, and those of the great citizens who have honored it; but for the rivers, gulfs, capes, and promontories, which we perceive from the top of this mountain, rather let us choose names which will recall their particular shape. They will impress themselves better on our memory, and at the same time will be more practical. The shape of the island is so strange that we shall not be troubled to imagine what it resembles. As to the streams which we do not know as yet, in different parts of the forest which we shall explore later, the creeks which afterwards will he discovered, we can christen them as we find them. What do you think, my friends?"</p> 
<p>The engineer's proposal was unanimously agreed to by his companions. The island was spread out under their eyes like a map, and they had only to give names to all its angles and points. Gideon Spilett would write them down, and the geographical nomenclature of the island would be definitely adopted. First, they named the two bays and the mountain, Union Bay, Washington Bay, and Mount Franklin, as the engineer had suggested.</p> 
<p>"Now," said the reporter, "to this peninsula at the southwest of the island, I propose to give the name of Serpentine Peninsula, and that of Reptile-end to the bent tail which terminates it, for it is just like a reptile's tail."</p> 
<p>"Adopted," said the engineer.</p> 
<p>"Now," said Herbert, pointing to the other extremity of the island, "let us call this gulf which is so singularly like a pair of open jaws, Shark Gulf."</p> 
<p>"Capital!" cried Pencroft, "and we can complete the resemblance by naming the two parts of the jaws Mandible Cape."</p> 
<p>"But there are two capes," observed the reporter.</p> 
<p>"Well," replied Pencroft, "we can have North Mandible Cape and South Mandible Cape."</p> 
<p>"They are inscribed," said Spilett.</p> 
<p>"There is only the point at the southeastern extremity of the island to be named," said Pencroft.</p> 
<p>"That is, the extremity of Union Bay?" asked Herbert.</p> 
<p>"Claw Cape," cried Neb directly, who also wished to be godfather to some part of his domain.</p> 
<p>In truth, Neb had found an excellent name, for this cape was very like the powerful claw of the fantastic animal which this singularly-shaped island represented.</p> 
<p>Pencroft was delighted at the turn things had taken, and their imaginations soon gave to the river which furnished the settlers with drinking water and near which the balloon had thrown them, the name of the Mercy, in true gratitude to Providence. To the islet upon which the castaways had first landed, the name of Safety Island; to the plateau which crowned the high granite precipice above the Chimneys, and from whence the gaze could embrace the whole of the vast bay, the name of Prospect Heights.</p> 
<p>Lastly, all the masses of impenetrable wood which covered the Serpentine Peninsula were named the forests of the Far West.</p> 
<p>The nomenclature of the visible and known parts of the island was thus finished, and later, they would complete it as they made fresh discoveries.</p> 
<p>As to the points of the compass, the engineer had roughly fixed them by the height and position of the sun, which placed Union Bay and Prospect Heights to the east. But the next day, by taking the exact hour of the rising and setting of the sun, and by marking its position between this rising and setting, he reckoned to fix the north of the island exactly, for, in consequence of its situation in the Southern Hemisphere, the sun, at the precise moment of its culmination, passed in the north and not in the south, as, in its apparent movement, it seems to do, to those places situated in the Northern Hemisphere.</p> 
<p>Everything was finished, and the settlers had only to descend Mount Franklin to return to the Chimneys, when Pencroft cried out,--</p> 
<p>"Well! we are preciously stupid!"</p> 
<p>"Why?" asked Gideon Spilett, who had closed his notebook and risen to depart.</p> 
<p>"Why! our island! we have forgotten to christen it!"</p> 
<p>Herbert was going to propose to give it the engineer's name and all his companions would have applauded him, when Cyrus Harding said simply,--</p> 
<p>"Let us give it the name of a great citizen, my friend; of him who now struggles to defend the unity of the American Republic! Let us call it Lincoln Island!"</p> 
<p>The engineer's proposal was replied to by three hurrahs.</p> 
<p>And that evening, before sleeping, the new colonists talked of their absent country; they spoke of the terrible war which stained it with blood; they could not doubt that the South would soon be subdued, and that the cause of the North, the cause of justice, would triumph, thanks to Grant, thanks to Lincoln!</p> 
<p>Now this happened the 30th of March, 1865. They little knew that sixteen days afterwards a frightful crime would be committed in Washington, and that on Good Friday Abraham Lincoln would fall by the hand of a fanatic.</p> 
<p>半个钟头以后，赛勒斯·史密斯和赫伯特回到了营地。工程师简单地告诉伙伴们说，上天把他们扔在一个荒岛上了，其他情况明天再研究。然后大家就去准备睡觉。这群荒岛上的居民，在海拔二千五百英尺的山洞里安安稳稳地睡了一夜。</p> 
<p>第二天，3月30日，匆匆忙忙地吃完了早饭——除了烤角雉以外，别的什么也没有——工程师打算再爬到火山顶上去，仔细观察一下，如果荒岛跟任何陆地都不接近，或是在往来太平洋各群岛的航线以外，那么他们就可能一辈子困守在这里。这一次伙伴们跟着他参加了新的探索。他们也想看一下荒岛，因为今后他们的一切需要都必须依靠岛上的物产来供应。</p> 
<p>早上七点钟左右，赛勒斯·史密斯、赫伯特、潘克洛夫、吉丁·史佩莱和纳布离开了营地。他们对于这个处境似乎并不感到焦急。他们对自己有信心。这是毫无疑问的，但是有一点必须指出，就是，史密斯的信心基础和他的伙伴们不一样。史密斯所以满怀着信心，因为他认为能够从这片荒凉的土地上取得他和他的伙伴们需要的一切生活必需品，而伙伴们所以毫不担忧则是因为有赛勒斯·史密斯和他们在一起。特别是潘克洛夫，自从生火的事情以后，他任何时候也不感到悲观，只要有工程师和他在一起，即使在一块光秃秃的石头上，他都不伯。</p> 
<p>“呸！”他说，“我们没有经过官方的许可一样能够离开里士满！何况这里肯定没有人会阻拦我们，我们要是再想不出法子逃出去，那才怪呢！”</p> 
<p>赛勒斯·史密斯按照昨晚走过的路出发。他们沿着形成山肩的高地，绕过火山锥向巨大的山洞走去。天气非常晴朗。太阳悬挂在万里无云的天空，阳光照遍了整个东面的山坡。</p> 
<p>他们走到火山口前。它和工程师在黑暗中所辨认出来的完全一样，也就是说，象一个庞大的漏斗，从上到下，愈来愈宽，从高地到顶端有一千英尺。洞口以下是一道道又宽又厚的熔岩，它们从山坡上蜿蜒到山下，标志着当初岩浆流向低处山谷的道路，荒岛的北部遍地都是这些山谷形成的凹沟。</p> 
<p>火山口内部的斜坡不过三十五度到四十度，爬上去既不困难也没有障碍。这里可以看出，很久以前遗留下来的熔岩大概还是在侧面的新喷口没有开出来以前从顶口上漫出来的。</p> 
<p>火山管从底层一直通向火山口，它的深度肉眼没法观测，因为光线太暗了。然而火山已经完全熄灭，这是毫无疑问的。</p> 
<p>不到八点钟，史密斯和他的伙伴们一起来到了火山口的顶峰，他们站在北边隆起的锥形小丘上。</p> 
<p>“海，到处是海！”他们不由自主地这样喊道，这句话使他们一变而为岛上的居民了。</p> 
<p>不错，一片辽阔无边的大海环绕着他们！也许赛勒斯·史密斯在没有二次爬上火山锥顶以前，还希望前一天晚上在黑暗中没有看清，希望这次能发现海滨和岛岸。然而远到天边，也就是说在半径五十多英里的圆周内，都没有任何东西。看不见一片陆地，没有一叶孤帆。周围空旷的地方只看见茫茫的海洋——荒岛就是这个辽阔无边的圆形的中心。</p> 
<p>工程师和他的伙伴们一动也不动地站在那里，默默地观察了几分钟，大海的每一个方向，直到最远的边缘都看遍了。潘克洛夫的眼睛向来好得出奇，然而他也看不见任何东西，如果水平线上有一片陆地，即使模糊得象水汽一样，肯定地说，水手也能找到的，他仿佛生来就带着一副望远镜。</p> 
<p>他们看完了海洋再回过头来看他们下面整个的海岛，吉丁·史佩莱首先问道：</p> 
<p>“这个岛大概有多大？”</p> 
<p>的确，在这漫无边际的海洋里，它显得并不大。</p> 
<p>赛勒斯·史密斯想了几分钟；他仔细地看了一下海岛的周围，考虑到他们所在的高度；然后说：</p> 
<p>“朋友们，岛的周围大约有一百多英里，我想是不会错的。”</p> 
<p>“那么面积呢？”</p> 
<p>“很难估计，”工程师答道，“因为地势太不规则了。”</p> 
<p>如果赛勒斯·史密斯估计得不错，那么这个岛就和地中海里的马耳他岛或赞德岛差不多大，不同的是它的地形复杂得多，而海角、地岬、地角、港湾和河流却比较少。这个扁的奇怪的地形特别显眼，吉丁·史佩莱根据工程师的意见把海岛的轮廓画了下来，他们觉得它很象一只奇怪的动物，仿佛是一只极大的海兽躺在太平洋的水面上。</p> 
<p>事实上海岛的形状确是这样，掌握了这一点是具有重大意义的，通讯记者立刻就相当正确地画了一张海岛的草图。</p> 
<p>海岸的东部——也就是这批遇难的人登陆的地方——形成一个宽阔的港湾，港湾尽头是一个突出的海角。潘克洛夫第一次观察的时候，因为被隆起的地岬遮住，所以没有看见。东北方另外有两个海角围着港湾，海角中间留着一道狭长的海峡，看起来象一只可怕的角蛟半张着嘴。</p> 
<p>从东北到西北海岸是弧形的，很象动物的扁平头盖。跟着海岸又往上突起，在地面上高出一大块，但是这部分海岛的形状不很清楚，海岛的中部就是火山。</p> 
<p>从这隆起的一点开始，海岸从南到北相当平直，沿岸三分之二的地方，有一条很窄的小河把海岸分开，从小河分割的地方起，海岸就成了长长的一小条，好象大鳄鱼的尾巴。</p> 
<p>这根尾巴向海里伸出三十多英里长，形成一个名符其实的半岛。半岛弯曲过来，形成一个可以停泊船只的宽阔海湾，它是这块地形特别的土地上的低海岸部分。</p> 
<p>从“石窟”到纬度相同的西海岸的小河，是海岛最狭的地方，距离只有十英里；可是最长的地方，也就是从东北的峡口到西南端的半岛尾部，至少有三十英里。</p> 
<p>海岛的内陆大致是这样的，从高山到南部海岸一带树木很多，北部则干燥多沙。在火山和东部海滨之间，出乎赛勒斯·史密斯和他的伙伴们的意料，竟发现有一个湖。沿湖生长着许多常绿树，岛上有这种树木，这倒是他们事先没有想到的。从山顶上看过去，这个湖好象和海面一样高，可是工程师衡量了一下，他告诉大家，湖面一定在高约三百英尺的地方，因为海滨向上延伸成一片高地，而湖就在高地上。</p> 
<p>“这是一个淡水湖吗？”潘克洛夫问道。</p> 
<p>“当然，”工程师说，“湖水一定是山里流下来的。”</p> 
<p>“看！一条小河往湖里流。”赫伯特指着一条很狭的溪水说，它显然是从西边一带流来的。</p> 
<p>“是的，”史密斯说，“既然有小河往湖里输送水，那么在靠海的地方一定有一个出口，湖水大多的时候就从那里排出去。我们回去的时候可以去看看。”</p> 
<p>岛上的水系至少包括这条曲折的小河和前面已经提到过的河流，这是探险家们已经看到的。然而，整个的海岛上几乎有三分之二覆盖着树木，形成一片广大的森林，因此也可能有其他的河流从树底下流到海里去，甚至可以这样推论，从这一带看来，这个地区内美丽的温带草木品种实在太多了。北部看不见有任何河流，也许东北部的沼泽地带可能有一些死水；除此以外就是一些沙丘、沙滩和干燥的土地。这和海岛上其余树木茂密的部分比起来，显得太不相同。</p> 
<p>火山并不在海岛的正中央，相反的，它耸立在西北部，好象成了这两个地带的分界线；在西南、正南和东南三面，第一部分的支脉都被绿荫遮盖住了。北边就不同，山脉的分支清清楚楚地摆在人的眼前，这些分支一直伸展到沙地的平原上才完。当初火山喷射的时候、就是向这一面冲开一个破口的，大堆的熔岩遍布到形成东北港湾的峡口。</p> 
<p>赛勒斯·史密斯和他的伙伴们在山顶上呆了一个钟头。海岛摆在他们的眼睛下面，象一个彩色的立体地形图，绿的代表森林，黄的代表沙地，蓝的代表水。他们把它全部看了一遍，除了绿荫覆盖下的土地、下塌的山谷和火山口的内壁以外，再没有什么隐藏着看不见的地方了。</p> 
<p>有一个重要的问题还没有解决，而这个问题的答案对这群遇难人的前途却有极大的影响。</p> 
<p>岛上有人吗？</p> 
<p>这个问题是通讯记者提出来的，经过一番仔细的观察，答案似乎是否定的。</p> 
<p>到处都没有人类开拓过的迹象。没有一簇房舍，没有一幢小屋，海滨上也没有一个渔场，陆地上没有一缕可以证明有人家的轻烟。固然，他们离最远的地方——也就是伸向西南的半岛一还有将近三十英里，即使潘克洛夫的眼睛，也很难看出那里有住宅。海岛四分之三的面积覆盖着森林，他们没法把它揭开来，看看底下是不是藏着稀落的村舍。可是总的看来，他们是落在太平洋里一个空旷的海岛上，这个海岛看来是没有人烟的荒野。</p> 
<p>要想最后肯定岛上有没有居民，那还需要经过更加彻底的探索。可是附近的岛屿上是不是经常——至少是偶尔——有土人到这儿来呢？这个问题很难回答。周围五十英里之内看不见陆地。可是不论是马来人的帆船还是玻里尼西亚人的独木舟，要想渡过五十英里的海面都很容易。问题要根据海岛的位置来决定，究竟是孤零零地独立在太平洋里，还是靠近什么群岛？赛勒斯·史密斯不用仪器能算出它们的经纬度来吗？这是困难的。在没有了解情况以前，应当依照附近的土人可能来到的情况作防备。</p> 
<p>海岛已经察看完毕了。他们肯定了它的形状，了解了它的地势，算出了它的大小，查清了它的山岳和河流。森林和平原的分布也由通讯记者概括地画下来了。现在只等下山从矿物、动物和植物这三方面来勘察这块土地的资源。</p> 
<p>在招呼伙伴们动身以前，赛勒斯·史密斯安详而沉着地对大家说：</p> 
<p>“朋友们，我们被上天扔在这一小块土地上了。我们要在这里生活，也许要住很久。如果碰巧有船经过，也可能突然得救。我所以说‘碰巧’，是因为这个海岛太小了。这里甚至连一个可以停船的港口也没有，恐怕我们是在一般船只的航线以外，也就是说，对经常来往太平洋各群岛的船只说来，我们的位置过于偏南，但对绕过合恩角到澳洲去的船只说来，我们又过于偏北了。关于我们的处境我丝毫不打算隐瞒你们……”</p> 
<p>“你说得对，亲爱的赛勒斯，”通讯记者兴奋地说。“跟你在一起的都是男子汉大丈夫。我们大家都信任你，你也可以信任大家。对不对，朋友们？”</p> 
<p>“我完全听你指挥。”赫伯特抓住工程师的手说。</p> 
<p>“不论是什么时候，什么地方，你都是我的主人！”纳布喊道。</p> 
<p>“我呢，”水手说，“不管叫我做什么，如果我要哼一声，我就不叫杰克·潘克洛夫，只要你愿意，我们就把这个海岛变成一个小美国！我们要开辟城市，铺筑铁道，拉起电线来打电报。有一天，等到岛上的面貌都改变了，一切都有条有理，变得很文明的时候，我们就把它移交给联合政府。现在我只有一个要求。”</p> 
<p>“什么要求？”通讯记者说。</p> 
<p>“就是：我们不要把自己当作遇难的人，只当是一群到这儿来开垦的移民。”</p> 
<p>史密斯不禁笑了起来，水手的提议被采纳了。于是他向大家表示感谢，并且补充说，他要依靠大家的力量。</p> 
<p>“好了，现在我们回‘石窟’去吧！”潘克洛夫大声说。</p> 
<p>“等一会儿，朋友们，”工程师说。“我觉得应该给这个海岛，还有我们所看见的那些海角、地岬和河流，起个名字。”</p> 
<p>“很好，”通讯记者说。“我们以后会有很多事情要做，有了名字就简单得多了。”</p> 
<p>“真的，”水手说，“现在我们来来去去已经有东西可以表达了。至少好象有这么个地方……”</p> 
<p>“比方说，‘石窟’吧。”赫伯特说。</p> 
<p>“一点儿也不错！”潘克洛夫说。“这个名字最方便了，这完全是我无意中想出来的。我们就把第一次过夜的地方叫做‘石窟’好吗，赛勒斯先生？”</p> 
<p>“行，潘克洛夫，既然你给它起了名字，就这么叫吧。”</p> 
<p>“好极了！其他的也好办，”水手兴高采烈地说。“赫伯特常跟我说鲁宾逊的故事，我们就模仿着鲁宾逊给这些地方起名字吧，象什么上苍湾、鲸鱼岬、失望角！”</p> 
<p>“要不然，用史密斯先生的名字，”赫伯特说，“史佩莱先生的名字，纳布的名字！……”</p> 
<p>“我的名字？”纳布露着他雪白晶莹的牙齿说。</p> 
<p>“有什么不行呢？”潘克洛夫答道。“纳布港，不很好吗？还有吉丁角……”</p> 
<p>“我赞成借用祖国的地名，”通讯记者说，“这样可以使我们不忘记美国。”</p> 
<p>“好，对于主要的地方，”赛勒斯·史密斯说，“我非常赞成这样来给港湾和海洋命名。比方说，我们可以把东边的那个大海湾叫做联合湾，把南边的那个大海湾叫做华盛顿湾；把我们所站的这座山叫做富兰克林山，把我们所瞧见的下面那个湖叫做格兰特湖；再好也没有了，朋友们。我们就用这些名字来怀念我们的祖国，纪念为国增光的那些伟大的公民。至于我们从这座山顶上所看见的那些河流、海湾、海角和地岬，最好还是根据它们形状的特点来命名。这样比较容易记住，而且更加切合实际。这个海岛的样子非常特别。我们要想出一个能表示出它的形状来的东西是不会困难的。各处森林里的河流我们现在虽然还不知道，但是这些森林将来是要去探索的，那些河流以及日后会发现的小溪，我们都可以随发现随命名。朋友们，你们认为怎么样？”</p> 
<p>工程师的提议得到了伙伴们的一致同意。海岛象一幅地图似的铺展在他们的眼睛下边，只差给各点各处都起个名字。吉丁·史佩莱把这些名字记下来以后，海岛的地理名称就算正式确定了。</p> 
<p>首先，他们根据工程师的提议，把两个港湾命名为联合湾和华盛顿湾，高山命名为富兰克林山。</p> 
<p>“现在，”通讯记者说，“我建议把海岛西南的那个半岛叫做盘蛇半岛，把半岛末端的那个弯尾巴叫做爬虫角，因为它很象爬虫的尾巴。”</p> 
<p>“同意。”工程师说。</p> 
<p>“现在，”赫伯特指着海岛的另一端说，“这个海湾简直跟张开的大鱼嘴一样，我们就把它叫做鲨鱼湾吧。”</p> 
<p>“好极了！”潘克洛夫大声说，“我们再把嘴的上下两部分叫做颚骨角，那就丝毫不差了。”</p> 
<p>“可是有两个海角呢。”通讯记者说。</p> 
<p>“不要紧，”潘克洛夫回答说，“我们可以把它们叫做北颚角和南颚角。”</p> 
<p>“都记下来了。”史佩莱说。</p> 
<p>“只剩荒岛东南端的海角没有名字了。”潘克洛夫说。</p> 
<p>“是联合湾的末端吗？”赫伯特问道。</p> 
<p>“就把它叫做爪角吧。”纳布脱口喊道，他也想成为他的一部分领土的教父。</p> 
<p>纳布起的名字很恰当，因为这片奇形怪状的陆地就象一只怪兽，而这个海角又正象怪兽坚强有力的利爪。</p> 
<p>潘克洛夫对事情的发展感到很满意。气球把他们降落在河水附近，使他们可以喝到这条河的淡水，于是他们很快地就给它想了一个名字，叫做慈悲河，表示对上苍真诚的感谢。遇难的人首先着陆的那个小岛被命名为安全岛，石窟的上方有一个高耸的花岗石峭壁，峭壁的顶端是一块高地，站在那里整个的海湾都在眼前了，他们就把这个高地命名为眺望岗。</p> 
<p>最后，他们又把覆盖着盘蛇半岛的整个密林叫做远西森林。</p> 
<p>海岛上看得见的和已经知道的地方就这样命名完毕了，将来再有新的发现，还要继续完成这项工作。</p> 
<p>至于各个部分的方位，工程师根据观测太阳的高度和方向的结果，大概作了一个测定：联合湾和眺望岗在正东。可是第二天，根据日出和日落的精确时间和记录中午时太阳的位置，他准确地断定了海岛的正北方向，由于海岛在南半球，因此太阳在正过中天的时候，经过的是北边而不是南边，跟在北半球所看到的太阳视动不一样。</p> 
<p>所有的工作都已完毕，居民们只等走下富兰克林山回石窟了，这时候潘克洛夫突然大叫起来：</p> 
<p>“好哇！我们真是大傻瓜！”</p> 
<p>“怎么？”吉丁·史佩莱问道，他已经合上笔记本，站起身来打算走了。</p> 
<p>“怎么！我们所在的岛，竟会忘记给它起名字了！”</p> 
<p>赫伯特正打算提议用工程师的名字来给海岛命名——伙伴们一定都会同意的——可是这时候赛勒斯·史密斯简单地说：</p> 
<p>“朋友们，我们用一个伟大的公民的名字来给它命名吧，这个公民现在正在为保卫美利坚共和国的统一而斗争，我们就把这个岛叫做林肯岛吧！”</p> 
<p>大家欢呼了三次，表示拥护工程师的建议。</p> 
<p>那天晚上睡觉以前，这群新来的移民谈到他们阔别了的祖国；谈到可怕的流血战争；他们深信南军很快就要失败，有了格兰特将军，有了林肯，北军的事业——也就是正义的事业——一定会胜利的?</p> 
<p>这是1865年3月30日的事情。他们想不到在十六天以后，华盛顿会发生一件可怕的阴谋，在受难日的星期五那天，亚伯拉罕·林肯竟死在一个丧心病狂的暴徒手里。</p>
