And woe to the insects which dared to venture there! No mercy was shown them.</p> 
<p>Towards the end of the month of June, after incessant rain, the weather became decidedly colder, and on the 29th a Fahrenheit thermometer would certainly have announced only twenty degrees above zero, that is considerably below the freezing-point. The next day, the 30th of June, the day which corresponds to the 31st of December in the northern year, was a Friday. Neb remarked that the year finished on a bad day, but Pencroft replied that naturally the next would begin on a good one, which was better.</p> 
<p>At any rate it commenced by very severe cold. Ice accumulated at the mouth of the Mercy, and it was not long before the whole expanse of the lake was frozen.</p> 
<p>The settlers had frequently been obliged to renew their store of wood. Pencroft also had wisely not waited till the river was frozen, but had brought enormous rafts of wood to their destination. The current was an indefatigable moving power, and it was employed in conveying the floating wood to the moment when the frost enchained it. To the fuel which was so abundantly supplied by the forest, they added several cartloads of coal, which had to be brought from the foot of the spurs of Mount Franklin. The powerful heat of the coal was greatly appreciated in the low temperature, which on the 4th of July fell to eight degrees of Fahrenheit, that is, thirteen degrees below zero. A second fireplace had been established in the dining-room, where they all worked together at their different avocations. During this period of cold, Cyrus Harding had great cause to congratulate himself on having brought to Granite House the little stream of water from Lake Grant. Taken below the frozen surface, and conducted through the passage, it preserved its fluidity, and arrived at an interior reservoir which had been hollowed out at the back part of the storeroom, while the overflow ran through the well to the sea.</p> 
<p>About this time, the weather being extremely dry, the colonists, clothed as warmly as possible, resolved to devote a day to the exploration of that part of the island between the Mercy and Claw Cape. It was a wide extent of marshy land, and they would probably find good sport, for water-birds ought to swarm there.</p> 
<p>They reckoned that it would be about eight or nine miles to go there, and as much to return, so that the whole of the day would be occupied. As an unknown part of the island was about to be explored, the whole colony took part in the expedition. Accordingly, on the 5th of July, at six o'clock in the morning, when day had scarcely broken, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, armed with spears, snares, bows and arrows, and provided with provisions, left Granite House, preceded by Top, who bounded before them.</p> 
<p>Their shortest way was to cross the Mercy on the ice, which then covered it.</p> 
<p>"But," as the engineer justly observed, "that could not take the place of a regular bridge!" So, the construction of a regular bridge was noted in the list of future works.</p> 
<p>It was the first time that the settlers had set foot on the right bank of the Mercy, and ventured into the midst of those gigantic and superb coniferae now sprinkled over with snow.</p> 
<p>But they had not gone half a mile when from a thicket a whole family of quadrupeds, who had made a home there, disturbed by Top, rushed forth into the open country.</p> 
<p>"Ah! I should say those are foxes!" cried Herbert, when he saw the troop rapidly decamping.</p> 
<p>They were foxes, but of a very large size, who uttered a sort of barking, at which Top seemed to be very much astonished, for he stopped short in the chase, and gave the swift animals time to disappear.</p> 
<p>The dog had reason to be surprised, as he did not know Natural History. But, by their barking, these foxes, with reddish-gray hair, black tails terminating in a white tuft, had betrayed their origin. So Herbert was able, without hesitating, to give them their real name of "Arctic foxes." They are frequently met with in Chile, in the Falkland Islands, and in all parts of America traversed by the thirtieth and fortieth parallels. Herbert much regretted that Top had not been able to catch one of these carnivora.</p> 
<p>"Are they good to eat?" asked Pencroft, who only regarded the representatives of the fauna in the island from one special point of view.</p> 
<p>"No," replied Herbert; "but zoologists have not yet found out if the eye of these foxes is diurnal or nocturnal, or whether it is correct to class them in the genus dog, properly so called."</p> 
<p>Harding could not help smiling on hearing the lad's reflection, which showed a thoughtful mind. As to the sailor, from the moment when he found that the foxes were not classed in the genus eatable, they were nothing to him. However, when a poultry-yard was established at Granite House, he observed that it would be best to take some precautions against a probable visit from these four-legged plunderers, and no one disputed this.</p> 
<p>After having turned the point, the settlers saw a long beach washed by the open sea. It was then eight o'clock in the morning. The sky was very clear, as it often is after prolonged cold; but warmed by their walk, neither Harding nor his companions felt the sharpness of the atmosphere too severely. Besides there was no wind, which made it much more bearable. A brilliant sun, but without any calorific action, was just issuing from the ocean. The sea was as tranquil and blue as that of a Mediterranean gulf, when the sky is clear. Claw Cape, bent in the form of a yataghan, tapered away nearly four miles to the southeast. To the left the edge of the marsh was abruptly ended by a little point. Certainly, in this part of Union Bay, which nothing sheltered from the open sea, not even a sandbank, ships beaten by the east winds would have found no shelter. They perceived by the tranquillity of the sea, in which no shallows troubled the waters, by its uniform color, which was stained by no yellow shades, by the absence of even a reef, that the coast was steep and that the ocean there covered a deep abyss. Behind in the west, but at a distance of four miles, rose the first trees of the forests of the Far West. They might have believed themselves to be on the desolate coast of some island in the Antarctic regions which the ice had invaded. The colonists halted at this place for breakfast. A fire of brushwood and dried seaweed was lighted, and Neb prepared the breakfast of cold meat, to which he added some cups of Oswego tea.</p> 
<p>While eating they looked around them. This part of Lincoln Island was very sterile, and contrasted with all the western part. The reporter was thus led to observe that if chance had thrown them at first on the shore, they would have had but a deplorable idea of their future domain.</p> 
<p>"I believe that we should not have been able to reach it," replied the engineer, "for the sea is deep, and there is not a rock on which we could have taken refuge. Before Granite House, at least, there were sandbanks, an islet, which multiplied our chances of safety. Here, nothing but the depths!"</p> 
<p>"It is singular enough," remarked Spilett, "that this comparatively small island should present such varied ground. This diversity of aspect, logically only belongs to continents of a certain extent. One would really say, that the western part of Lincoln Island, so rich and so fertile, is washed by the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and that its shores to the north and the southeast extend over a sort of Arctic sea."</p> 
<p>"You are right, my dear Spilett," replied Cyrus Harding, "I have also observed this. I think the form and also the nature of this island strange. It is a summary of all the aspects which a continent presents, and I should not be surprised if it was a continent formerly."</p> 
<p>"What! a continent in the middle of the Pacific?" cried Pencroft.</p> 
<p>"Why not?" replied Cyrus Harding. "Why should not Australia, New Ireland, Australasia, united to the archipelagoes of the Pacific, have once formed a sixth part of the world, as important as Europe or Asia, as Africa or the two Americas? To my mind, it is quite possible that all these islands, emerging from this vast ocean, are but the summits of a continent, now submerged, but which was above the waters at a prehistoric period."</p> 
<p>"As the Atlantis was formerly," replied Herbert.</p> 
<p>"Yes, my boy... if, however, it existed."</p> 
<p>"And would Lincoln Island have been a part of that continent?" asked Pencroft.</p> 
<p>"It is probable," replied Cyrus Harding, "and that would sufficiently, explain the variety of productions which are seen on its surface."</p> 
<p>"And the great number of animals which still inhabit it," added Herbert.</p> 
<p>"Yes, my boy," replied the engineer, "and you furnish me with an argument to support my theory. It is certain, after what we have seen, that animals are numerous in this island, and what is more strange, that the species are extremely varied. There is a reason for that, and to me it is that Lincoln Island may have formerly been a part of some vast continent which had gradually sunk below the Pacific."</p> 
<p>"Then, some fine day," said Pencroft, who did not appear to be entirely convinced, "the rest of this ancient continent may disappear in its turn, and there will be nothing between America and Asia."</p> 
<p>"Yes," replied Harding, "there will be new continents which millions and millions of animalculae are building at this moment."</p> 
<p>"And what are these masons?" asked Pencroft.</p> 
<p>"Coral insects," replied Cyrus Harding. "By constant work they made the island of Clermont-Tonnerre, and numerous other coral islands in the Pacific Ocean. Forty-seven millions of these insects are needed to weigh a grain, and yet, with the sea-salt they absorb, the solid elements of water which they assimilate, these animalculae produce limestone, and this limestone forms enormous submarine erections, of which the hardness and solidity equal granite. Formerly, at the first periods of creation, nature employing fire, heaved up the land, but now she entrusts to these microscopic creatures the task of replacing this agent, of which the dynamic power in the interior of the globe has evidently diminished--which is proved by the number of volcanoes on the surface of the earth, now actually extinct. And I believe that centuries succeeding to centuries, and insects to insects, this Pacific may one day be changed into a vast continent, which new generations will inhabit and civilize in their turn."</p> 
<p>"That will take a long time," said Pencroft.</p> 
<p>"Nature has time for it," replied the engineer.</p> 
<p>"But what would be the use of new continents?" asked Herbert. "It appears to me that the present extent of habitable countries is sufficient for humanity. Yet nature does nothing uselessly."</p> 
<p>"Nothing uselessly, certainly," replied the engineer, "but this is how the necessity of new continents for the future, and exactly on the tropical zone occupied by the coral islands, may be explained. At least to me this explanation appears plausible."</p> 
<p>"We are listening, captain," said Herbert.</p> 
<p>"This is my idea: philosophers generally admit that some day our globe will end, or rather that animal and vegetable life will no longer be possible, because of the intense cold to which it will be subjected. What they are not agreed upon, is the cause of this cold. Some think that it will arise from the falling of the temperature, which the sun will experience alter millions of years; others, from the gradual extinction of the fires in the interior of our globe, which have a greater influence on it than is generally supposed. I hold to this last hypothesis, grounding it on the fact that the moon is really a cold star, which is no longer habitable, although the sun continues to throw on its surface the same amount of heat. If, then, the moon has become cold, it is because the interior fires to which, as do all the stars of the stellar world, it owes its origin, are completely extinct. Lastly, whatever may be the cause, our globe will become cold some day, but this cold will only operate gradually. What will happen, then? The temperate zones, at a more or less distant period, will not be more habitable than the polar regions now are. Then the population of men, as well as the animals, will flow towards the latitudes which are more directly under the solar influence. An immense emigration will take place. Europe, Central Asia, North America, will gradually be abandoned, as well as Australasia and the lower parts of South America. The vegetation will follow the human emigration. The flora will retreat towards the Equator at the same time as the fauna. The central parts of South America and Africa will be the continents chiefly inhabited. The Laplanders and the Samoides will find the climate of the polar regions on the shores of the Mediterranean. Who can say, that at this period, the equatorial regions will not be too small, to contain and nourish terrestrial humanity? Now, may not provident nature, so as to give refuge to all the vegetable and animal emigration, be at present laying the foundation of a new continent under the Equator, and may she not have entrusted these insects with the construction of it? I have often thought of all these things, my friends, and I seriously believe that the aspect of our globe will some day be completely changed; that by the raising of new continents the sea will cover the old, and that, in future ages, a Columbus will go to discover the islands of Chimborazo, of the Himalayas, or of Mont Blanc, remains of a submerged America, Asia, and Europe. Then these new continents will become, in their turn, uninhabitable; heat will die away, as does the heat from a body when the soul has left it; and life will disappear from the globe, if not for ever, at least for a period. Perhaps then, our spheroid will rest-- will be left to death--to revive some day under superior conditions! But all that, my friends, is the secret of the Author of all things; and beginning by the work of the insects, I have perhaps let myself be carried too far, in investigating the secrets of the future.</p> 
<p>"My dear Cyrus," replied Spilett, "these theories are prophecies to me, and they will be accomplished some day."</p> 
<p>"That is the secret of God," said the engineer.</p> 
<p>"All that is well and good," then said Pencroft, who had listened with all his might, "but will you tell me, captain, if Lincoln Island has been made by your insects?"</p> 
<p>"No," replied Harding; "it is of a purely volcanic origin."</p> 
<p>"Then it will disappear some day?"</p> 
<p>"That is probable.</p> 
<p>"I hope we won't be here then."</p> 
<p>"No, don't be uneasy, Pencroft; we shall not be here then, as we have no wish to die here, and hope to get away some time."</p> 
<p>"In the meantime," replied Gideon Spilett, "let us establish ourselves here as if forever. There is no use in doing things by halves."</p> 
<p>This ended the conversation. Breakfast was finished, the exploration was continued, and the settlers arrived at the border of the marshy region. It was a marsh of which the extent, to the rounded coast which terminated the island at the southeast, was about twenty square miles. The soil was formed of clayey flint-earth, mingled with vegetable matter, such as the remains of rushes, reeds, grass, etc. Here and there beds of grass, thick as a carpet, covered it. In many places icy pools sparkled in the sun. Neither rain nor any river, increased by a sudden swelling, could supply these ponds. They therefore naturally concluded that the marsh was fed by the infiltrations of the soil and it was really so. It was also to be feared that during the heat miasmas would arise, which might produce fevers.</p> 
<p>Above the aquatic plants, on the surface of the stagnant water, fluttered numbers of birds. Wild duck, teal, snipe lived there in flocks, and those fearless birds allowed themselves to be easily approached.</p> 
<p>One shot from a gun would certainly have brought down some dozen of the birds, they were so close together. The explorers were, however, obliged to content themselves with bows and arrows. The result was less, but the silent arrow had the advantage of not frightening the birds, while the noise of firearms would have dispersed them to all parts of the marsh. The hunters were satisfied, for this time, with a dozen ducks, which had white bodies with a band of cinnamon, a green head, wings black, white, and red, and flattened beak. Herbert called them tadorns. Top helped in the capture of these birds, whose name was given to this marshy part of the island. The settlers had here an abundant reserve of aquatic game. At some future time they meant to explore it more carefully, and it was probable that some of the birds there might be domesticated, or at least brought to the shores of the lake, so that they would be more within their reach.</p> 
<p>About five o'clock in the evening Cyrus Harding and his companions retraced their steps to their dwelling by traversing Tadorn's Fens, and crossed the Mercy on the ice-bridge.</p> 
<p>At eight in the evening they all entered Granite House.</p> 
<p>从此以后，潘克洛夫没有一天不到他称为“麦田”的那块地方去。要是有什么昆虫胆敢到那里去，那它就该倒楣了！潘克洛夫对它们毫不客气。</p> 
<p>将近六月底，一连几天阴雨以后，天气显著地变冷了。29日那天，温度在华氏20度左右（摄氏冰点以下6度67分），第二天是6月30日，相当于北半球的12月31日，这一天是星期五。纳布说这一年的最后一天不吉利，可是潘克洛夫却说这样更好，因为明年的第一天是个好日子。</p> 
<p>不管怎么样，年初总是非常寒冷的。慈悲河口已经封冻，不久以后，整个的格兰特湖面也要结冰了。</p> 
<p>居民们经常需要补充木材。潘克洛夫很机灵，他乘河水没有封冻的那几天，利用木筏运了大批的木柴回来。河水是一股不知疲倦的动力，他们利用它运送木柴，直到结冰的时候为止。除了从森林里取得大量燃料以外，他们又从富兰克林山的支脉下运了几车煤炭回来。在天冷的时候，能产生高温的煤炭大受欢迎。到7月4日那天，温度只有华氏8度，也就是摄氏零下13度。大家通常是在饭厅里做各种不同工作的，因此在这里又砌了一个火炉。“花岗石宫”里用的水原来是赛勒斯·史密斯从格兰特湖里引来的，现在天虽然冷了，从冰面下把湖水输送过来的水道却始终保持畅通，他对于这一小股流水很满意。为了积贮流来的湖水，还在仓库后面凿了一个蓄水池，池满了，多余的水就通过地下井流到海里去了。</p> 
<p>这些天天气非常干燥，移民们决定选一个日子穿足衣服，到慈悲河与爪角之间去探险。那是一片广阔的沼泽，他们认为在那里可以打到上好的野味，因为这种地区可能有很多水禽。</p> 
<p>他们估计到那里有八九英里的路程，来回需要一整天的工夫。由于目的地是岛上还没有到过的地区，因此全体移民都参加了这次远征。7月5日早上六点钟，天刚破晓，赛勒斯·史密斯、吉丁·史佩莱、赫伯特、纳布和潘克洛夫就拿着标枪、圈套、弓箭，准备着干粮，从“花岗石宫”出发了，托普乱蹦乱跳地在前面领着路。</p> 
<p>这时候慈悲河已经结冰了，最近的路是从冰面上过河。</p> 
<p>“可是，”工程师说得很对，“这并不能代替正规的桥梁！”因此，搭桥被列为未来的工作之一。</p> 
<p>居民们还是第一次踏上慈悲河的右岸，冒险深入高大而美丽的松柏林，这些树上现在都披上了一层雪花。</p> 
<p>他们走了还不到半英里，就有一窝在密林里安家的走兽被托普惊动，向空旷的地方窜去了。</p> 
<p>“啊！我看象是狐狸！”赫伯特看着这群忙着搬家的动物说。</p> 
<p>这是一群狐狸，然而个子非常大，托普在追赶途中听到它们发出一种嗥叫声，吓了一跳，突然站住了，这些跑得极快的动物便乘机逃得无影无踪。</p> 
<p>狗是不懂得博物学的，难怪它要吃惊。可是经过这么一叫，这些浑身灰红，黑尾巴梢上长一绺白毛的狐狸，就等于把它的身份暴露出来了。赫伯特毫不犹豫地告诉大家，这种兽的学名叫“白狐”。在智利、福克兰群岛以及美国北纬30度与40度之间的整个区域里都可以看到。使赫伯特感到遗憾的是：这种食肉动物托普竟一只也没有捉住。</p> 
<p>“好吃吗。”潘克洛夫问道，他对于海岛上的动物只关心这一点。</p> 
<p>“不好吃，”赫伯特说，“可是动物学家们到现在为止还不知道这种狐狸长的是昼眼还是夜眼，也不知道一般把它和狗归到一类是不是正确。”</p> 
<p>少年记得很熟，可见他对这门功课非常钻研，史密斯听了以后，不禁微笑起来。至于水手，他一听说这种狐狸不属于“可食类”，就不把它放在心里了。不过他也认为将来在“花岗石宫”附近建立家禽场以后，应该小心一些，以防这些四只脚的强盗去光顾，对这点大家都没有意见。</p> 
<p>绕过这一带，居民们发现有很长的一段海滩被海水冲击着。这时候正是早上八点钟，天气非常晴朗，长期的严寒以后，天气往往会这样。他们走了一段路，觉得暖和起来，史密斯和他的伙伴们都已经不感到寒气袭人。并且，由于没有刮风，虽冷也不是那么叫人吃不消。水平线上旭日初升，然而丝毫也没有暖意。海面上风平浪静，一片蔚蓝，和晴天的地中海港湾一样。爪角象一把弯刀，向东南拐去，直到四英里以外的地方，愈到尖端愈细。左边沼泽地带的边缘突然形成一个小尖角，这时候被火一般的阳光照射着。联合湾的这部分没有任何东西可做大海的屏障，连一片沙滩也没有，如果有船只遭到东风的袭击，显然是设法躲避的。这里海面平静，没有浅滩。海水的颜色到处都是一样，没有土黄的色调，连一块礁石也没有；海岸陡峭，根据所看到的这一切，可以断定沿岸一带海水很深，水面以下就是万丈深渊，背后往西四英里的地方，就是远西森林的边缘了。他们可以认为这里是冰雪侵袭下南极岛屿的荒凉海岸。移民们在这里停下来吃早饭，用木柴和晒干的海藻生了一堆火，纳布把冻肉烤成早点，此外还沏了几杯薄荷茶。</p> 
<p>他们一面吃，一面瞧着四面八方。林肯岛的这部分非常贫瘠，和整个的西部形成鲜明的对比。通讯记者不禁想起，如果当初掉在这部分海岸上，他们一定想象不出未来的领土是什么样子。</p> 
<p>“我相信要是掉在这里，我们是上不了岸的，”工程师说，“这里海水很深，连一块可以攀扶的石头都没有。‘花岗石宫’前面至少有一些沙滩。特别是那个小岛，它大大地增加了我们脱险的可能。这里什么也没有，只有万丈深渊！”</p> 
<p>“真奇怪，”史佩莱说，“这么小的海岛，地形居然这样复杂，按理说，这种复杂的地形只有在相当大的陆地上才有。真可以这样说，林肯岛的西部物产富饶，土地肥沃，是由于有墨西哥暖流经过的缘故；而北边和东南地区却好象沿着北冰洋一样。”</p> 
<p>“你说得有道理，亲爱的史佩莱，”赛勒斯·史密斯说，“我也注意到这一点了。我觉得这个海岛的地形和自然状况都很特别。它概括了大陆的全部面貌，要说它过去是一块大陆，我一点也不觉得奇怪。”</p> 
<p>“什么！太平洋中间有大陆？”潘克洛夫大声说。</p> 
<p>“这有什么稀奇？”赛勒斯·史密斯答道。“澳大利亚、新爱尔兰、澳大拉西亚和太平洋里的群岛难道还不能称为世界上的第六大洲吗？难道它不和欧洲、亚洲、非洲以及两个美洲同样重要吗？我认为所有这些大洋里的岛屿都可能是一个大陆的高脊，大陆现在是沉在水里了，可是在人类有史以前，它们是在水面上的。”</p> 
<p>“象过去的亚特兰梯斯一样。”赫伯特说。</p> 
<p>“是的，孩子……假如真有的话，就是这样的。”</p> 
<p>“林肯岛会不会就是那片大陆的一部分呢？”潘克洛夫问道。</p> 
<p>“可能，”赛勒斯·史密斯说，“那就容易说明岛上各种物产都有的原因了。”</p> 
<p>“还有遗留下来的大批飞禽走兽。”赫伯特补充说。</p> 
<p>“是的，孩子，”工程师说，“你这么一说给我的理论找到根据了。按照视察的结果，岛上有很多动物，这一点可以肯定，更奇怪的是，动物的种类非常多。这是有原因的，我认为林肯岛过去可能是什么大陆的一部分，后来大陆逐渐沉到太平洋底下去了。”</p> 
<p>“那么，总有一天，”潘克洛夫说，他好象并不完全相信。“古代剩下的这部分大陆会全部沉下去的，那时候，美洲和亚洲之间就什么陆地也没有了。”</p> 
<p>“不，”史密斯说，“将来会有新大陆的，现在有成千上万的微生物正在兴建着。”</p> 
<p>“这些泥水匠是什么东西呢？”潘克洛夫问道。</p> 
<p>“珊瑚虫，”赛勒斯·史密斯答道。“它们不断兴建的结果，形成了克列蒙岛和太平洋里其他许多的珊瑚岛。四千七百万个这样的昆虫才只有一厘米重，可是吸收了海里的盐分、消化了水里所存在的固体物质以后，这种微生物就能产生出石灰来，而且这种石灰能在海底构成大块的物质，和花岗石一样的坚硬，一样的结实。过去，在古代初期的时候，大自然利用火积成陆地。现在地壳内部的动力显然是减退了（地面上有许多火山现在都已完全熄灭，这就足以证明这一点），可是有微生物来接替火的职务。我相信一年一年地过去，经过许许多多数都数不清的珊瑚虫的努力积累，太平洋早晚有一天会变成一片大陆，供给我们的后代去居住和开发的。”</p> 
<p>“那可需要很长的时间。”潘克洛夫说。</p> 
<p>“大自然有的是时间进行这项工作。”工程师说。</p> 
<p>“可是要新大陆有什么用呢？”赫伯特问道。“我觉得现在适合人类居住的地方已经足够了，当然，大自然创造出来的东西是不会没有用的。”</p> 
<p>“不错，不会没有用的，”工程师答道，“这就是为什么在珊瑚岛所占的热带地区将来一定要有新大陆的原因，至少我认为这样解释是合情合理的。”</p> 
<p>“你给我们详细讲讲吧，史密斯先生。”赫伯特说。</p> 
<p>“这是我的看法。科学家们一般都认为地球将来是会毁灭的，至少到将来动植物都不能生存了，因为那时候地球上要变得非常寒冷。他们意见分歧的地方只是在于造成这种严寒的原因。有人认为千百万年以后，地球会由于太阳的温度下降而变冷，有人认为是由于地球内部火焰的逐渐熄灭。这种影响会比一般想象的要大，我同意后面这种说法。根据什么呢？譬如：月亮实际上是一颗冷冰冰的星球，虽然太阳永远不偏不倚，一点也不少给它热，然而它上面却不能住人，月亮所以这样冷，那就是因为它内部的火焰——宇宙间所有的星球，包括月亮在内，都是由这种火焰产生的——完全熄灭了。最后，什么原因先不去管它，我们的地球总有一天要冷却的，这种冷却的过程只会逐渐地发生。那么，到那时候会产生什么情况呢？温带地区经过相当时期以后，就要和我们现在的南北极地带一样不能住人了。人类和其他动物都会大批地向赤道地带涌去。那时候会形成大规模的移民。欧洲、中亚细亚、北美洲都会逐渐被放弃，澳大拉西亚和南美洲的南部也是这样，那里的草木也将随着人转移。植物会和动物同时向赤道发展。南美洲的中部和非洲的中部将要成为主要的居住大陆。拉伯兰人和萨摩亚人会发现地中海沿岸的气候和寒带一样。很可能那时候赤道地区会嫌太挤，资源也不够地球上的人类消耗，那有谁能料得到呢，可是自然界是眼光远大的，它现在就在赤道地区打下新大陆的基础，使所有迁来的动植物都不至于没处安身，这不很好吗？这些小昆虫不也可能就是受自然界委托来进行这项工作的吗？所有这些事情我经常想。朋友们，而且我深信我们的地球将来会变得面目全非。新大陆产生以后，大海就要把原有的陆地淹没，在未来的时代里，会有一个象哥伦布那样的人发现琛玻拉索山、喜马拉雅山和勃朗山所形成的岛屿，它们是美洲、亚洲和欧洲下沉以后的遗迹。然后，就要轮到这些新大陆变得不能居住了；热度会逐渐消散，就好象人死了身体慢慢地冷下来似的。那时候地球上的生命就要绝迹了，即使不是永久绝迹，至少也要有一个时期。也许那时候，我们的整个地球都安息了——变得死气沉沉——等到条件转好的时候，再复活过来！可是，朋友们，所有这些都是自然的秘密。我从珊瑚虫的工作谈起，直研究到未来的秘密，也许扯得太远了。”</p> 
<p>“亲爱的赛勒斯，”史佩莱答道，“我认为这些理论都是预言，将来会实现的。”</p> 
<p>“那是上帝的秘密。”工程师说。</p> 
<p>“你们说得都不错，”潘克洛夫聚精会神地听完以后说，“可是你能告诉我吗，史密斯先生，林肯岛是不是你说的那些虫子做的？”</p> 
<p>“不，”史密斯答道，“这里纯粹是由火山造成的。”</p> 
<p>“那么将来它会消灭吗？”</p> 
<p>“可能。”</p> 
<p>“但愿那时候我们已经不在这儿了。”</p> 
<p>“不，不要担心，潘克洛夫；那时候我们不会在这儿的，因为我们并不想老死在这里，我们还希望早晚有一天要离开这儿呢。”</p> 
<p>“不过，”吉丁·史佩莱说，“我们还应当象永远住在这里似的建立自己的家园。事情做到一半就泄气不干是不会有结果的。”</p> 
<p>话谈到这里就结束了。吃完早饭以后，继续前进，居民们到了沼泽的边缘地带。这片沼泽大约有二十平方英里，一直延伸到海岛东南的圆形海岸，土壤是火山粘土，夹杂着一些腐烂的植物，例如灯芯草、芦苇、野草等的残余。一层厚草象地毯似的铺在沼地各处。不少的水坑都结了冰，在太阳底下闪闪发光。雨水和暴涨的河水都不可能在这里积成池塘。因此他们认为沼地的水分是由土壤里渗透出来的，这是很自然的，而事实上也的确是这样。天热的时候，这里可能有瘴气使人生病。</p> 
<p>死水塘里长着一些水生植物，许多飞禽在上面扑着翅膀。野鸭、小凫、鹬都成群地栖居在这里，它们一点都不伯人，人们可以一直走到它们的旁边去。</p> 
<p>这些水禽密麻麻地聚集在一起，一枪准能打死好几打。然而探险家们却只好使用弓箭。效果虽然差一些，但也有一个好处，就是没有响声，不致惊动其他飞鸟，如果是枪声，那就要把它们吓得飞往沼地各处去了。这一次猎人满意了，他们打到一打鸭子，这些鸭子身上是白的，上面有一道黄褐色的花纹，头是绿的，翅膀上共有黑、白、红三种颜色，长着扁平的嘴；赫伯特把它们叫做潦凫。在捕捉时托普也出了力。他们就把海岛的这部分叫做潦凫沼地。居民们可以从这里得到大量的水鸟。他们打算以后再来仔细侦察一下，可能发现一些可以驯养的鸟类，如果能把它们赶到湖边去，捉起来就方便得多了。</p> 
<p>傍晚五点钟的时候，赛勒斯·史密斯和他的伙伴们穿过潦凫沼地，渡过慈悲河上的“冰桥”，往回走去。</p> 
<p>晚上八点钟，他们回到了“花岗石宫”。</p>
