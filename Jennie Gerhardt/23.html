Jennie proposed to tell her mother the whole truth, and there was nothing to say to her father except that she was going with Mrs. Bracebridge at the latter’s request. He might question her, but he really could not doubt. Before going home that afternoon she accompanied Lester to a department store, where she was fitted out with a trunk, a suit-case, and a travelling suit and hat. Lester was very proud of his prize. “When we get to New York I am going to get you some real things,” he told her. “I am going to show you what you can be made to look like.” He had all the purchased articles packed in the trunk and sent to his hotel. Then he arranged to have Jennie come there and dress Monday for the trip which began in the afternoon.
<br> 
<br> When she came home Mrs. Gerhardt, who was in the kitchen, received her with her usual affectionate greeting. “Have you been working very hard?” she asked. “You look tired.”
<br> 
<br> “No,” she said, “I’m not tired. It isn’t that. I just don’t feel good.”
<br> 
<br> “What’s the trouble?”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, I have to tell you something, mamma. It’s so hard.” She paused, looking inquiringly at her mother, and then away.
<br> 
<br> “Why, what is it?” asked her mother nervously. So many things had happened in the past that she was always on the alert for some new calamity. “You haven’t lost your place, have you?”
<br> 
<br> “No,” replied Jennie, with an effort to maintain her mental poise, “but I’m going to leave it.”
<br> 
<br> “No!” exclaimed her mother. “Why?”
<br> 
<br> “I’m going to New York.”
<br> 
<br> Her mother’s eyes opened widely. “Why, when did you decide to do that?” she inquired.
<br> 
<br> “To-day.”
<br> 
<br> “You don’t mean it!”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, I do, mamma. Listen. I’ve got something I want to tell you. You know how poor we are. There isn’t any way we can make things come out right. I have found some one who wants to help us. He says he loves me, and he wants me to go to New York with him Monday. I’ve decided to go.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, Jennie!” exclaimed her mother. “Surely not! You wouldn’t do anything like that after all that’s happened. Think of your father.”
<br> 
<br> “I’ve thought it all out,” went on Jennie, firmly. “It’s really for the best. He’s a good man. I know he is. He has lots of money. He wants me to go with him, and I’d better go. He will take a new house for us when we come back and help us to get along. No one will ever have me as a wife — you know that. It might as well be this way. He loves me. And I love him. Why shouldn’t I go?”
<br> 
<br> “Does he know about Vesta?” asked her mother cautiously.
<br> 
<br> “No,” said Jennie guiltily. “I thought I’d better not tell him about her. She oughtn’t to be brought into it if I can help it.”
<br> 
<br> “I’m afraid you’re storing up trouble for yourself, Jennie,” said her mother. “Don’t you think he is sure to find it out some time?”
<br> 
<br> “I thought maybe that she could be kept here,” suggested Jennie, “until she’s old enough to go to school. Then maybe I could send her somewhere.”
<br> 
<br> “She might,” assented her mother; “but don’t you think it would be better to tell him now? He won’t think any the worse of you.”
<br> 
<br> “It isn’t that. It’s her,” said Jennie passionately. “I don’t want her to be brought into it.”
<br> 
<br> Her mother shook her head. “Where did you meet him?” she inquired.
<br> 
<br> “At Mrs. Bracebridge’s.”
<br> 
<br> “How long ago?”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, it’s been almost two months now.”
<br> 
<br> “And you never said anything about him,” protested Mrs. Gerhardt reproachfully.
<br> 
<br> “I didn’t know that he cared for me this way,” said Jennie defensively.
<br> 
<br> “Why didn’t you wait and let him come out here first?” asked her mother. “It will make things so much easier. You can’t go and not have your father find out.”
<br> 
<br> “I thought I’d say I was going with Mrs. Bracebridge. Papa can’t object to my going with her.”
<br> 
<br> “No,” agreed her mother thoughtfully.
<br> 
<br> The two looked at each other in silence. Mrs. Gerhardt, with her imaginative nature, endeavoured to formulate some picture of this new and wonderful personality that had come into Jennie’s life. He was wealthy; he wanted to take Jennie; he wanted to give them a good home. What a story!
<br> 
<br> “And he gave me this,” put in Jennie, who, with some instinctive psychic faculty, had been following her mother’s mood. She opened her dress at the neck, and took out the two hundred and fifty dollars; she placed the money in her mother’s hands.
<br> 
<br> The latter stared at it wide-eyed. Here was the relief for all her woes — food, clothes, rent, coal — all done up in one small package of green and yellow bills. If there were plenty of money in the house Gerhardt need not worry about his burned hands; George and Martha and Veronica could be clothed in comfort and made happy. Jennie could dress better; there would be a future education for Vesta.
<br> 
<br> “Do you think he might ever want to marry you?” asked her mother finally.
<br> 
<br> “I don’t know,” replied Jennie, “he might. I know he loves me.”
<br> 
<br> “Well,” said her mother after a long pause, “if you’re going to tell your father you’d better do it right away. He’ll think it’s strange as it is.”
<br> 
<br> Jennie realised that she had won. Her mother had acquiesced from sheer force of circumstances. She was sorry, but somehow it seemed to be for the best. “I’ll help you out with it,” her mother had concluded, with a little sigh.
<br> 
<br> The difficulty of telling this lie was very great for Mrs. Gerhardt, but she went through the falsehood with a seeming nonchalance which allayed Gerhardt’s suspicions. The children were also told, and when, after the general discussion, Jennie repeated the falsehood to her father it seemed natural enough.
<br> 
<br> “How long do you think you’ll be gone?” he inquired.
<br> 
<br> “About two or three weeks,” she replied.
<br> 
<br> “That’s a nice trip,” he said. “I came through New York in 1844. It was a small place then compared to what it is now.”
<br> 
<br> Secretly he was pleased that Jennie should have this fine chance. Her employer must like her.
<br> 
<br> When Monday came Jennie bade her parents good-bye and left early, going straight to the Dornton, where Lester awaited her.
<br> 
<br> “So you came,” he said gaily, greeting her as she entered the ladies’ parlour.
<br> 
<br> “Yes,” she said simply.
<br> 
<br> “You are my niece,” he went on. “I have engaged a room for you near mine. I’ll call for the key, and you go dress. When you’re ready I’ll have the trunk sent to the depot. The train leaves at one o’clock.”
<br> 
<br> She went to her room and dressed, while he fidgeted about, read, smoked, and finally knocked at her door.
<br> 
<br> She replied by opening to him, fully clad.
<br> 
<br> “You look charming,” he said with a smile.
<br> 
<br> She looked down, for she was nervous and distraught. The whole process of planning, lying, nerving herself to carry out her part had been hard on her. She looked tired and worried.
<br> 
<br> “Not grieving, are you?” he asked, seeing how things stood.
<br> 
<br> “No-o,” she replied.
<br> 
<br> “Come now, sweet. You mustn’t feel this way. It’s coming out all right.” He took her in his arms and kissed her, and they strolled down the hall. He was astonished to see how well she looked in even these simple clothes — the best she had ever had.
<br> 
<br> They reached the depot after a short carriage ride. The accommodations had been arranged for before hand, and Kane had allowed just enough time to make the train. When they settled themselves in a Pullman state-room it was with a keen sense of satisfaction on his part. Life looked rosy. Jennie was beside him. He had succeeded in what he had started out to do. So might it always be.
<br> 
<br> As the train rolled out of the depot and the long reaches of the fields succeeded Jennie studied them wistfully. There were the forests, leafless and bare; the wide, brown fields, wet with the rains of winter; the low farm-houses sitting amid flat stretches of prairie, their low roofs making them look as if they were hugging the ground. The train roared past little hamlets, with cottages of white and yellow and drab, their roofs blackened by frost and rain. Jennie noted one in particular which seemed to recall the old neighbourhood where they used to live at Columbus; she put her handkerchief to her eyes and began silently to cry.
<br> 
<br> “I hope you’re not crying, are you, Jennie?” said Lester, looking up suddenly from the letter he had been reading. “Come, come,” he went on as he saw a faint tremor shaking her. “This won’t do. You have to do better than this. You’ll never get along if you act that way.”
<br> 
<br> She made no reply, and the depth of her silent grief filled him with strange sympathies.
<br> 
<br> “Don’t cry,” he continued soothingly; “everything will be all right. I told you that. You needn’t worry about anything.”
<br> 
<br> Jennie made a great effort to recover herself, and began to dry her eyes.
<br> 
<br> “You don’t want to give way like that,” he continued. “It doesn’t do you any good. I know how you feel about leaving home, but tears won’t help it any. It isn’t as if you were going away for good, you know. Besides, you’ll be going back shortly. You care for me, don’t you, sweet? I’m something?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes,” she said, and managed to smile back at him. Lester returned to his correspondence and Jennie fell to thinking of Vesta. It troubled her to realise that she was keeping this secret from one who was already very dear to her. She knew that she ought to tell Lester about the child, but she shrank from the painful necessity. Perhaps later on she might find the courage to do it.
<br> 
<br> “I’ll have to tell him something,” she thought with a sudden upwelling of feeling as regarded the seriousness of this duty. “If I don’t do it soon and I should go and live with him and he should find it out he would never forgive me. He might turn me out, and then where would I go? I have no home now. What would I do with Vesta?”
<br> 
<br> She turned to contemplate him, a premonitory wave of terror sweeping over her, but she only saw that imposing and comfort-loving soul quietly reading his letters, his smoothly shaved red cheek and comfortable head and body looking anything but militant or like an avenging Nemesis. She was just withdrawing her gaze when he looked up.
<br> 
<br> “Well, have you washed all your sins away?” he inquired merrily.
<br> 
<br> She smiled faintly at the allusion. The touch of fact in it made it slightly piquant.
<br> 
<br> “I expect so,” she replied.
<br> 
<br> He turned to some other topic, while she looked out of the window, the realisation that one impulse to tell him had proved unavailing dwelling in her mind. “I’ll have to do it shortly,” she thought, and consoled herself with the idea that she would surely find courage before long.
<br> 
<br> Their arrival in New York the next day raised the important question in Lester’s mind as to where he should stop. New York was a very large place, and he was not in much danger of encountering people who would know him, but he thought it just as well not to take chances. Accordingly he had the cabman drive them to one of the more exclusive apartment hotels, where he engaged a suite of rooms; and they settled themselves for a stay of two or three weeks.
<br> 
<br> This atmosphere into which Jennie was now plunged was so wonderful, so illuminating, that she could scarcely believe this was the same world that she had inhabited before. Kane was no lover of vulgar display. The appointments with which he surrounded himself were always simple and elegant. He knew at a glance what Jennie needed, and bought for her with discrimination and care. And Jennie, a woman, took a keen pleasure in the handsome gowns and pretty fripperies that he lavished upon her. Could this be really Jennie Gerhardt, the washerwoman’s daughter, she asked herself, as she gazed in her mirror at the figure of a girl clad in blue velvet, with yellow French lace at her throat and upon her arms? Could these be her feet, clad in soft shapely shoes at ten dollars a pair, these her hands adorned with flashing jewels? What wonderful good fortune she was enjoying! And Lester had promised that her mother would share in it. Tears sprang to her eyes at the thought. The dear mother, how she loved her!
<br> 
<br> It was Lester’s pleasure in these days to see what he could do to make her look like some one truly worthy of him. He exercised his most careful judgment, and the result surprised even himself. People turned in the halls, in the dining-rooms, and on the street to gaze at Jennie.
<br> 
<br> “A stunning woman that man has with him,” was a frequent comment.
<br> 
<br> Despite her altered state Jennie did not lose her judgment of life or her sense of perspective or proportion. She felt as though life were tentatively loaning her something which would be taken away after a time. There was no pretty vanity in her bosom. Lester realised this as he watched her. “You’re a big woman, in your way,” he said. “You’ll amount to something. Life hasn’t given you much of a deal up to now.”
<br> 
<br> He wondered how he could justify this new relationship to his family, should they chance to hear about it. If he should decide to take a home in Chicago or St. Louis (there was such a thought running in his mind) could he maintain it secretly? Did he want to? He was half persuaded that he really, truly loved her.
<br> 
<br> As the time drew near for their return he began to counsel her as to her future course of action. “You ought to find some way of introducing me, as an acquaintance, to your father,” he said. “It will ease matters up. I think I’ll call. Then if you tell him you’re going to marry me he’ll think nothing of it.” Jennie thought of Vesta, and trembled inwardly. But perhaps her father could be induced to remain silent.
<br> 
<br> Lester had made the wise suggestion that she should retain the clothes she had worn in Cleveland in order that she might wear them home when she reached there. “There won’t be any trouble about this other stuff,” he said. “I’ll have it cared for until we make some other arrangement.” It was all very simple and easy; he was a master strategist.
<br> 
<br> Jennie had written her mother almost daily since she had been East. She had enclosed little separate notes to be read by Mrs. Gerhardt only. In one she explained Lester’s desire to call, and urged her mother to prepare the way by telling her father that she had met some one who liked her. She spoke of the difficulty concerning Vesta, and her mother at once began to plan a campaign to have Gerhardt hold his peace. There must be no hitch now. Jennie must be given an opportunity to better herself. When she returned there was great rejoicing. Of course she could not go back to her work, but Mrs. Gerhardt explained that Mrs. Bracebridge had given Jennie a few weeks’ vacation in order that she might look for something better, something at which she could make more money.
