Obscurity</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      To make anything very terrible, obscurity4 seems in general to be necessary. When we know the full extent of any danger, when we can accustom our eyes to it, a great deal of the apprehension vanishes. Every one will be sensible of this, who considers how greatly night adds to our dread, in all cases of danger, and how much the notions of ghosts and goblins, of which none can form clear ideas, affect minds which give credit to the popular tales concerning such sorts of beings. Those despotic governments which are founded on the passions of men, and principally upon the passion of fear, keep their chief as much as may be from the public eye. The policy has been the same in many cases of religion. Almost all the heathen temples were dark. Even in the barbarous temples of the Americans at this day, they keep their idol in a dark part of the hut, which is consecrated to his worship. For this purpose too the Druids performed all their ceremonies in the bosom of the darkest woods, and in the shade of the oldest and most spreading oaks. No person seems better to have understood the secret of heightening, or of setting terrible things, if I may use the expression, in their strongest light, by the force of a judicious obscurity than Milton. His description of death in the second book is admirably studied; it is astonishing with what a gloomy pomp, with what a significant and expressive uncertainty of strokes and coloring, he has finished the portrait of the king of terrors:
<br> 
<br> “The other shape,
<br> 
<br> If shape it might be called that shape had none
<br> 
<br> Distinguishable, in member, joint, or limb;
<br> 
<br> Or substance might be called that shadow seemed;
<br> 
<br> For each seemed either; black he stood as night;
<br> 
<br> Fierce as ten furies; terrible as hell;
<br> 
<br> And shook a deadly dart. What seemed his head
<br> 
<br> The likeness of a kingly crown had on.”
<br> 
<br> In this description all is dark, uncertain, confused, terrible, and sublime to the last degree.
