The illumination is enriched by the admirable blending of colors in the canopy of shawls. Within the space defined by the five lamps, on a tufted rug, the Mystic and the Emir are seated, both in Ihram, and looking cool and comfortable, though the night outside still testifies to the heat of the day.</p> 
<p>A wooden trencher, scoured white as ivory, separates the friends, leaving them face to face. In supping they have reached what we call the dessert.</p> 
<p>On the trencher are slender baskets containing grapes, figs, and dates, the choicest of the gardens of Medina. A jar of honey, an assortment of dry biscuits, and two jugs, one of water, the other of juice of pomegranates, with drinking cups, complete the board.</p> 
<p>At this age, Orientals lingering at table have the cheer of coffee and tobacco; unhappily for the two of whom we are writing, neither of the great narcotics was discovered. Nevertheless it should not be supposed the fruits, the honey, and the waters failed to content them. Behind the host is the negro we already know as Nilo. He is very watchful of his master's every motion.</p> 
<p>As guest and host appear now the formalism of acquaintanceship just made has somewhat disappeared, and they are talking easily and with freedom. Occasionally a movement of one or the other brings his head to a favorable angle, whereat the light, dropping on the freshly shaven crown, is sharply glinted back.</p> 
<p>The Emir has been speaking of the plague.</p> 
<p>"At Medina I was told it had run its course," the host remarked.</p> 
<p>"True, O Hadji, but it has returned, and with greater violence. The stragglers were its victims; now it attacks indiscriminately. Yesterday the guard I keep in the rear came to a pilgrim of rank. His litter was deserted, and he was lying in it dead."</p> 
<p>"The man may have been murdered."</p> 
<p>"Nay," said the Emir, "gold in large amount was found on his person."</p> 
<p>"But he had other property doubtless?"</p> 
<p>"Of great value."</p> 
<p>"What disposition was made of it?"</p> 
<p>"It was brought to me, and is now with other stores in my tent; a law of ancient institution vesting it in the Emir El Hajj."</p> 
<p>The countenance of the Jew became serious.</p> 
<p>"The ownership was not in my thought," he said, waving his hand. "I knew the law; but this scourge of Allah has its laws also, and by one of them we are enjoined to burn or bury whatever is found with the body."</p> 
<p>The Emir, seeing the kindly concern of his host, smiled as he answered:</p> 
<p>"But there is a higher law, O Hadji."</p> 
<p>"I spoke without thinking danger of any kind could disturb thee."</p> 
<p>The host drew forward the date basket, and the Emir, fancying he discerned something on his mind besides the fruit, waited his further speech.</p> 
<p>"I am reminded of another matter, O brave Emir; but as it also is personal I hesitate. Indeed I will not speak of it except with permission."</p> 
<p>"As you will," the other replied, "I will answer--May the Prophet help me!"</p> 
<p>"Blessed be the Prophet!" said the Prince, reverently. "Thy confidence doeth me honor, and I thank thee; at the same time I would not presume upon it if thy tongue were less suggestive of a land whose name is music--Italy. It is in my knowledge, O Emir, that the Sultan, thy master--may Allah keep him in countenance!--hath in his service many excellent soldiers by birth of other countries than his own, broad as it is--Christians, who are none the less of the true faith. Wherefore, wilt thou tell me of thyself?"</p> 
<p>The question did not embarrass the Emir.</p> 
<p>"The answer must be brief," he answered, without hesitation, "because there is little to tell. I do not know my native country. The peculiarity of accent you have mentioned has been observed by others; and as they agreed with you in assigning it to Italy, I am nothing loath to account myself an Italian. The few shreds of circumstance which came to me in course of time confirmed the opinion, and I availed myself of a favorable opportunity to acquire the tongue. In our further speech, O Hadji, you may prefer its use."</p> 
<p>"At thy pleasure," the host replied; "though there is no danger of our being overheard. Nilo, the slave behind me, has been a mute from birth."</p> 
<p>Then, without the slightest interruption, the Emir changed his speech from Greek to Italian.</p> 
<p>"My earliest remembrance is of being borne in a woman's arms out of doors, under a blue sky, along a margin of white sand, an orchard on one hand, the sea on the other. The report of the waves breaking upon the shore lives distinctly in my memory; so does the color of the trees in the orchard which has since become familiar to me as the green of olives. Equally clear is the recollection that, returning in-doors, I was carried into a house of stone so large it must have been a castle. I speak of it, as of the orchard, and the sea, and the roar of the breakers, quite as much by reference to what I have subsequently seen as from trust in my memory."</p> 
<p>Here the host interrupted him to remark:</p> 
<p>"Though an Eastern, I have been a traveller in the west, and the description reminds me of the eastern shore of Italy in the region of Brindisi."</p> 
<p>"My next recollection," the Emir resumed, "is a child's fright, occasioned by furious flames, and thick smoke, and noises familiar now as of battle. There was then a voyage on the sea during which I saw none but bearded men. The period of perfect knowledge so far as my history is concerned began when I found myself an object of the love and care of the wife of a renowned Pacha, governor of the city of Brousa. She called me Mirza. My childhood was spent in a harem, and I passed from it into a school to enter upon my training as a soldier. In good time I became a Janissary. An opportunity presented itself one day, and I distinguished myself. My master, the Sultan, rewarded me by promotion and transfer to the Silihdars, [Footnote: D'Oheson.] the most ancient and favored corps of the Imperial army, it being the body-guard of the Padisha, and garrison of his palace. The yellow flag my ensign carries belongs to that corps. As a further token of his confidence, the Sultan appointed me Emir El Hajj. In these few words, O Hadji, you have my history."</p> 
<p>The listener was impressed with the simplicity of the narrative, and the speaker's freedom from regret, sorrow, or passion of any kind.</p> 
<p>"It is a sad story, O Emir," he said, sympathetically, "and I cannot think it ended. Knowest thou not more?"</p> 
<p>"Nothing of incident," was the reply. "All that remains is inferential. The castle was attacked at night by Turks landed from their galleys."</p> 
<p>"And thy father and mother?"</p> 
<p>"I never knew them."</p> 
<p>"There is another inference," said the Prince, suggestively--"they were Christians."</p> 
<p>"Yes, but unbelievers."</p> 
<p>The suppression of natural affection betrayed by the remark still more astonished the host.</p> 
<p>"But they believed in God," he said.</p> 
<p>"They should have believed Mahomet was his Prophet."</p> 
<p>"I fear I am giving you pain, O Emir."</p> 
<p>"Dismiss the fear, O Hadji."</p> 
<p>Again the Jew sought the choicest date in the basket. The indifference of his guest was quick fuel to the misgivings which we have already noticed as taking form about his purpose, and sapping and weakening it. To be arbiter in the religious disputes of men, the unique consummation called for by his scheme, the disputants must concede him room and hearing. Were all Mohammedans, from whom he hoped most, like this one born of Christians, then the two conditions would be sternly refused him. By the testimony of this witness, there was nothing in the heredity of faith; and it went to his soul incisively that, in stimulating the passions which made the crusades a recurrence of the centuries, he himself had contributed to the defeat now threatening his latest ambition. The sting went to his soul; yet, by force of will, always at command in the presence of strangers, he repressed his feeling, and said:</p> 
<p>"Everything is as Allah wills. Let us rejoice that he is our keeper. The determination of our fate, in the sense of what shall happen to us, and what we shall be, and when and where the end shall overtake us, is no more to him than deciding the tint of the rose before the bud is formed. O Emir, I congratulate you on the resignation with which you accept his judgment. I congratulate you upon the age in which he has cast your life. He who in a moment of uncertainty would inform himself of his future should not heed his intentions and hopes; by studying his present conditions, he will find himself an oracle unto himself. He should address his best mind to the question, 'I am now in a road; if I keep it, where will I arrive?' And wisdom will answer, 'What are thy desires? For what art thou fitted? What are the opportunities of the time?' Most fortunate, O Emir, if there be correspondence between the desire, the fitness, and the opportunity!"</p> 
<p>The Emir did not comprehend, and seeing it, the host added with a directness approaching the abrupt:</p> 
<p>"And now to make the reason of my congratulations clear, it is necessary that thou consent to my putting a seal upon your lips. What sayest thou?"</p> 
<p>"If I engage my silence, O Hadji, it is because I believe you are a good man."</p> 
<p>The dignity of the Emir's answer did not entirely hide the effect of the Prince's manner.</p> 
<p>"Know thou then," the latter continued, with a steady, penetrating gaze--"know thou then, there is a Brahman of my acquaintance who is a Magus. I use the word to distinguish him from the necromancers whom the Koran has set in everlasting prohibition. He keeps school in a chapel hid away in the heart of jungles overgrowing a bank of the Bermapootra, not far from the mountain gates of the river. He has many scholars, and his intelligence has compassed all knowledge. He is familiar with the supernatural as with the natural. On my way, I visited him.... Know thou next, O Emir, I too have had occasion to make inquiries of the future. The vulgar would call me an astrologer--not a professional practising for profit, but an adept seeking information because it lifts me so much nearer Allah and his sublimest mysteries. Very lately I found a celestial horoscope announcing a change in the status of the world. The masterful waves, as you may know, have for many ages flowed from the West; but now, the old Roman impetus having at last spent itself, a refluence is to set in, and the East in its turn pour a dominating flood upon the West. The determining stars have slipped their influences. They are in motion. Constantinople is doomed!"</p> 
<p>The guest drew a quick breath. Understanding was flooding him with light.</p> 
<p>"And now, O Emir, say, if the revelation had stopped there--stopped, I mean, with the overthrow of the Christian capital--wouldst thou have been satisfied with it?"</p> 
<p>"No, by Allah, no!"</p> 
<p>"Further, Emir. The stars being communicable yet, what wouldst thou have asked them next?"</p> 
<p>"I would not have rested until I had from them the name of him who is to be leader in the movement."</p> 
<p>The Mystic smiled at the young man's fervor.</p> 
<p>"Thou hast saved me telling what I did, and affirmed the logic of our human nature," he said. "Thy imperial master is old, and much worn by wars and cares of government, is he not?"</p> 
<p>"Old in greatness," answered the Emir, diplomatically.</p> 
<p>"Hath he not a son?"</p> 
<p>"A son with all the royal qualities of the father."</p> 
<p>"But young--not more than eighteen."</p> 
<p>"Not more."</p> 
<p>"And the Prophet hath lent him his name?"</p> 
<p>"Even so."</p> 
<p>The host released the eager face of the Emir from his gaze, while he sought a date in the basket.</p> 
<p>"Another horoscope--the second"--he then said, quietly, "revealed everything but the hero's name. He is to be of kingly birth, and a Turk. Though a lad, he is already used to arms and armor."</p> 
<p>"Oh! by Allah, Hadji," cried the guest, his face flushed, his words quick, his voice mandatory. "Release me from my pledge of silence. Tell me who thou art, that I may report thee, and the things thou sayest. There was never such news to warm a heroic heart."</p> 
<p>The Prince pursued his explanation without apparently noticing the interruption noticing the interruption.</p> 
<p>"To verify the confidences of the stars, I sought the Magus in his chapel by the sacred river. Together we consulted them, and made the calculations. He embraced me; but it was agreed between us that absolute verity of the finding could only be had by re-casting the horoscopes at Constantinople. Thou must know, O Emir, there is an astral alphabet which has its origin in the inter-relations of the heavenly bodies, represented by lines impalpable to the common eye; know also that the most favored adept cannot read the mystic letters with the assurance best comporting with verity, except he be at the place of the destined event or revolution. To possess myself of the advantage, I shall ere long visit the ancient capital. More plainly, I am on the way thither now."</p> 
<p>Instead of allaying the eagerness of the Emir, the words excited it the more.</p> 
<p>"Release me from my pledge," he repeated, entreatingly, "and tell me who thou art. Mahommed is my pupil; he rides, carries shield, lays lance, draws arrow, and strikes with sword and axe as I have taught him. Thou canst not name a quality characteristic of heroes he does not possess. Doth Allah permit me safe return from the Hajj, he will be first to meet me at his father's gate. Think what happiness I should have in saluting him there with the title--Hail Mahommed, Conqueror of Constantinople!"</p> 
<p>The Jew answered:</p> 
<p>"I would gladly help thee, O Emir, to happiness and promotion; for I see what afterwhile, if not presently, they would follow such a salutation of thy pupil, if coupled with a sufficient explanation; but his interests are paramount; at the same time it becomes me to be allegiant to the divinatory stars. What rivalries the story might awaken! It is not uncommon in history, as thou mayst know, that sons of promise have been cut off by jealous fathers. I am not accusing the great Amurath; nevertheless precautions are always proper."</p> 
<p>The speaker then became dramatic.</p> 
<p>"Nay, brave Emir, the will to help thee has been already seconded by the deed. I spoke but now of lines of correspondence between the shining lights that are the life of the sky at night. Let me illustrate my meaning. Observe the lamps about us. The five on the uprights. Between them, in the air, two stars of interwoven form are drawn. Take the lamps as determining points, and use thy fancy a moment."</p> 
<p>The Emir turned to the lamps; and the host, swift to understand the impulse, gave him time to gratify it; then he resumed:</p> 
<p>"So the fields of Heaven between the stars, where the vulgar see only darkness, are filled with traceries infinite in form yet separable as the letters of the alphabet. They are the ciphers in which Allah writes his reasons for every creation, and his will concerning it. There the sands are numbered, and the plants and trees, and their leaves, and the birds, and everything animate; there is thy history, and mine, and all of little and great and good and bad that shall befall us in this life. Death does not blot out the records. Everlastingly writ, they shall be everlastingly read--for the shame of some, for the delight of others."</p> 
<p>"Allah is good," said the Emir, bending his head.</p> 
<p>"And now," the Mystic continued, "thou hast eaten and drunk with me in the Pentagram of the Magii. Such is the astral drawing between the five lamps. Henceforth in conflicts of interest, fortune against fortune, influences undreamt of will come to thy assistance. So much have I already done for thee."</p> 
<p>The Emir bowed lower than before.</p> 
<p>"Nor that alone," the Jew continued. "Henceforth our lives will run together on lines never divergent, never crossing. Be not astonished, if, within a week, I furnish, to thy full satisfaction, proof of what I am saying."</p> 
<p>The expression could not be viewed except as of more than friendly interest.</p> 
<p>"Should it so happen," the Emir said, with warmth, "consider how unfortunate my situation would be, not knowing the name or country of my benefactor."</p> 
<p>The host answered simply, though evasively:</p> 
<p>"There are reasons of state, O Emir, requiring me to make this pilgrimage unknown to any one."</p> 
<p>The Emir apologized.</p> 
<p>"It is enough," the host added, "that thou remember me as the Prince of India, whose greatest happiness is to believe in Allah and Mahomet his Prophet; at the same time I concede we should have the means of certainly knowing each other should communication become desirable hereafter."</p> 
<p>He made a sign with his right hand which the negro in waiting responded to by passing around in front of him.</p> 
<p>"Nilo," the master said in Greek, "bring me the two malachite rings--those with the turquoise eyes."</p> 
<p>The slave disappeared.</p> 
<p>"Touching the request to be released from the promise of secrecy, pardon me, O Emir, if I decline to grant it. The verification to be made in Constantinople should advise thee that the revolution to which I referred is not ripe for publication to the world. A son might be excused for dishonoring his parents; but the Magus who would subject the divine science to danger of ridicule or contempt by premature disclosure is fallen past hope--he would betray Allah himself."</p> 
<p>The Emir bowed, but with evident discontent. At length the slave returned with the rings.</p> 
<p>"Observe, O Emir," the Jew said, passing them both to his guest, "they are rare, curious, and exactly alike."</p> 
<p>The circlets were of gold, with raised settings of deep green stone, cut so as to leave a drop of pure turquoise on the top of each, suggestive of birds' eyes.</p> 
<p>"They are exactly the same, O Prince," said the Emir, tendering them back.</p> 
<p>The Jew waved his hand.</p> 
<p>"Select one of them," he said, "and I will retain the other. Borne by messengers, they will always identify us each to the other."</p> 
<p>The two grew more cordial, and there was much further conversation across the board, interspersed with attentions to the fruit basket and pomegranate water. About midnight the Emir took his departure. When he was gone, the host walked to and fro a long time; once he halted, and said aloud--"I hear his salute, 'Hail Mahommed, Conqueror of Constantinople !' It is always well to have a store of strings for one's bow."</p> 
<p>And to himself he laughed heartily.</p> 
<p>Next day at dawn the great caravan was afoot, every man, woman, and child clad in Ihram, and whitening the pale green Valley.</p>
