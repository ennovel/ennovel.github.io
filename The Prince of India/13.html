He took exercise daily on the flat roof; and walking to and fro there, found three objects of attraction: the hill to the southwest with the church upon it, the Palace of Blacherne off further in the west, and the Tower of Galata. The latter, across the Golden Horn in the north, arose boldly, like a light-house on a cliff; yet, for a reason--probably because it had connection with the subject of his incessant meditations--he paused oftenest to gaze at the Palace.</p> 
<p>He was in his study one day deeply absorbed. The sun, nearing meridian, poured a stream of white light through the south window, flooding the table at which he sat. That the reader may know something of the paths the Mystic most frequented when in meditation, we will make free with one of the privileges belonging to us as a chronicler.</p> 
<p>The volume directly in front of him on the table, done in olive wood strengthened at the corners with silver, was near two feet in length, and one and a half in width; when closed, it would be about one foot thick. Now he had many wonderful rare and rich antiques, but none so the apple of his eye as this; for it was one of the fifty Holy Bibles of Greek transcription ordered by Constantine the Great.</p> 
<p>At his right, held flat by weights, were the Sacred Books of China, in form a roll of broad-leafed vellum.</p> 
<p>At his left, a roll somewhat similar in form and at the moment open, lay the Rig-Veda of the Aryans in Sanscrit.</p> 
<p>The fourth book was the Avesta of Zoroaster--a collection of MSS. stitched together, and exquisitely rendered by Parse devas into the Zend language.</p> 
<p>A fifth book was the Koran.</p> 
<p>The arrangement of the volumes around the Judean Bible was silently expressive of the student's superior respect; and as from time to time, after reading a paragraph from one of the others, he returned to the great central treasure, it was apparent he was making a close comparison of texts with reference to a particular theme, using the Scriptures as a standard. Most of the time he kept the forefinger of his left hand on what is now known as the fourteenth verse of the third chapter of Exodus--"And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you." If, as the Prince himself had declared, religion were indeed the study of most interest to the greatest number of men, he was logically consistent in comparing the definitions of God in the Bibles of theistic nations. So had he occupied himself since morning. The shrewd reader will at once discern the theme of his comparative study.</p> 
<p>At length he grew weary of bending over the books, and of the persistent fixedness of attention required for the pursuit of fine shades of meaning in many different languages. He threw his arms up in aid of a yawn, and turned partly around, his eyes outrunning the movement of his body. The half-introverted glance brightened with a gleam, and remained fixed, while the arms dropped down. He could only look in wonder at what he saw--eyes black and almost large as his own gazing at him in timid surprise. Beholding nothing but the eyes, he had the awesome feeling which attends imagining a spirit suddenly risen; then he saw a forehead low, round, and white, half shaded by fluffs of dark hair; then a face of cherubic color and regularity, to which the eyes gave an indefinable innocency of expression.</p> 
<p>Every one knows the effect of trifles on the memory. A verse or a word, the smell of a flower, a lock of hair, a turn in music, will not merely bring the past back, but invest it with a miraculous recurrency of events. The Prince's gaze endured. He stretched his hand out as if fearful lest what he saw might vanish. The gesture was at once an impulse and an expression. There was a time--tradition says it was the year in which he provoked the curse--when he had wife and child. To one of them, possibly both, the eyes then looking into his might have belonged. The likeness unmanned him. The hand he stretched forth fell lightly upon the head of the intruder.</p> 
<p>"What are you?" he said.</p> 
<p>The vagueness of the expression will serve excellently as a definition of his condition; at the same time it plunged the child addressed into doubt. Presently she answered:</p> 
<p>"I am a little girl."</p> 
<p>Accepting the simplicity of the reply as evidence of innocency too extreme for fear, he took the visitor in his arms, and sat her on his knee.</p> 
<p>"I did not mean to ask what you are, but who?" he said.</p> 
<p>"Uel is my father."</p> 
<p>"Uel? Well, he is my friend, and I am his; therefore you and I should be friends. What is your name?"</p> 
<p>"He calls me Gul Bahar."</p> 
<p>"Oh! That is Turkish, and means Rose of Spring. How came you by it?"</p> 
<p>"My mother was from Iconium."</p> 
<p>"Yes--where the Sultans used to live."</p> 
<p>"And she could speak Turkish."</p> 
<p>"I see! Gul Bahar is an endearment, not a real name."</p> 
<p>"My real name is Lael."</p> 
<p>The Prince paled from cheek to brow; his lips trembled; the arm encircling her shook; and looking into his eyes, she saw tears dim them. After a long breath, he said, with inexpressible tenderness, and as if speaking to one standing just behind her--"Lael!" Then, the tears full formed, he laid his forehead on her shoulder so his white hair blent freely with her chestnut locks; and sitting passively, but wondering, she heard him sob and sob again and again, like another child. Soon, from pure sympathy, unknowing why, she too began sobbing. Several minutes passed thus; then, raising his face, and observing her responsive sorrow, he felt the need of explanation.</p> 
<p>"Forgive me," he said, kissing her, "and do not wonder at me. I am old--very old--older than thy father, and there have been so many things to distress me which other men know nothing of, and never can. I had once"--</p> 
<p>He stopped, repeated the long breath, and gazed as at a far object.</p> 
<p>"I too had once a little girl."</p> 
<p>Pausing, he dropped his eyes to hers.</p> 
<p>"How old are you?"</p> 
<p>"Next spring I shall be fourteen," she answered.</p> 
<p>"And she was just your age, and so like you--so small, and with such hair and eyes and face; and she was named Lael. I wanted to call her Rimah, for she seemed a song to me; but her mother said, as she was a gift from the Lord, she wanted in the fulness of days to give her back to him, and that the wish might become a covenant, she insisted on calling her Lael, which, in Hebrew--thy father's tongue and mine--means To God."</p> 
<p>The child, listening with all her soul, was now not in the least afraid of him; without waiting, she made the application.</p> 
<p>"You loved her, I know," she said</p> 
<p>"How much--Oh, how much!"</p> 
<p>"Where is she now?"</p> 
<p>"At Jerusalem there was a gate called the Golden Gate. It looked to the east. The sun, rising over the top of Mount Olivet, struck the plates of gold and Corinthian brass more precious than gold, so it seemed one rosy flame. The dust at its rocky sill, and the ground about it are holy. There, deep down, my Lael lies. A stone that tasked many oxen to move it covers her; yet, in the last day, she will be among the first to rise--Of such excellence is it to be buried before that Golden Gate."</p> 
<p>"Oh! she is dead!" the child exclaimed.</p> 
<p>"She is dead;" and seeing her much affected, he hastened to say, "I shed many tears thinking of her. Ah, how gentle and truthful she was! And how beautiful! I cannot forget her. I would not if I could; but you who look so like her will take her place in my heart now, and love me as she did; and I will love you even as I loved her. I will take you into my life, believing she has come again. In the morning I will ask first, Where is my Lael? At noon, I will demand if the day has been kind to her; and the night shall not be half set in except I know it has brought her the sweetness of sleep. Will you be my Lael?"</p> 
<p>The question perplexed the child, and she was silent.</p> 
<p>Again he asked, "Will you be my Lael?"</p> 
<p>The earnestness with which he put the question was that of a hunger less for love than an object to love. The latter is not often accounted a passion, yet it creates necessities which are peremptory as those of any passion. One of the incidents of the curse he was suffering was that he knew the certainty of the coming of a day when he must be a mourner for whomsoever he should take into his heart, and in this way expiate whatever happiness the indulgence might bring him. Nevertheless the craving endured, at times a positive hunger. In other words, his was still a human nature. The simplicity and beauty of the girl were enough to win him of themselves; but when she reminded him of the other asleep under a great rock before the gate of the Holy City, when the name of the lost one was brought to him so unexpectedly, it seemed there had been a resurrection, making it possible for him to go about once more as he was accustomed to in his first household. A third time he asked, "You will be my Lael?"</p> 
<p>"Can I have two fathers?" she returned.</p> 
<p>"Oh, yes!" he answered quickly. "One in fact, the other by adoption; and they can both love you the same."</p> 
<p>Immediately her face became a picture of childish trust.</p> 
<p>"Then I will be your Lael too."</p> 
<p>He clasped her close to his breast, and kissed her, crying:</p> 
<p>"My Lael has come back to me! God of my fathers, I thank thee!"</p> 
<p>She respected his emotion, but at length, with her hand upon his shoulder, said:</p> 
<p>"You and my father are friends, and thinking he came here, I came too."</p> 
<p>"Is he at home?"</p> 
<p>"I think so."</p> 
<p>"Then we will go to him. You cannot be my Lael without his consent."</p> 
<p>Presently, hand in hand, they descended the stairs, crossed the street, and were in the shopkeeper's presence.</p> 
<p>The room was plainly but comfortably furnished as became the proprietor's fortune and occupation. Closer acquaintance, it is to be said, had dissipated the latent dread, which, as has been seen, marked Uel's first thought of intimacy between the stranger and the child. Seeing him old, and rich, and given to study, not to say careless of ordinary things, the father was beginning to entertain the idea that it might in some way be of advantage to the child could she become an object of interest to him. Wherefore, as they entered now, he received them with a smile.</p> 
<p>Traces of the emotion he had undergone were in the Prince's face, and when he spoke his voice was tremulous.</p> 
<p>"Son of Jahdai," he said, standing, "I had once a wife and child. They perished-how and when, I cannot trust myself to tell. I have been faithful to their memory. From the day I lost them, I have gone up and down the world hunting for many things which I imagined might renew the happiness I had from them. I have been prodigal of gratitude, admiration, friendship, and goodwill, and bestowed them singly and together, and often; but never have I been without consciousness of something else demanding to be given. Happiness is not all in receiving. I passed on a long time before it came to me that we are rich in affections not intended for hoarding, and that no one can be truly content without at least one object on which to lavish them. Here"--and he laid his hand on the child's head--"here is mine, found at last."</p> 
<p>"Lael is a good girl," Uel said with pride.</p> 
<p>"Yes, and as thou lovest her let me love her," the Prince responded. Then, seeing Uel become serious, he added, "To help thee to my meaning, Lael was my child's name, and she was the image of this one; and as she died when fourteen, thy Lael's age, it is to me as if the tomb had miraculously rendered its victim back to me."</p> 
<p>"Prince," said Uel, "had I thought she would not be agreeable to you, I should have been sorry."</p> 
<p>"Understand, son of Jahdai," the other interposed, "I seek more of thee than thy permission to love her. I want to do by her as though she were mine naturally."</p> 
<p>"You would not take her from me?"</p> 
<p>"No. That would leave thee bereft as I have been. Like me, thou wouldst then go up and down looking for some one to take her place in thy heart. Be thou her father still; only let me help thee fashion her future."</p> 
<p>"Her birthrights are humble," the shopkeeper answered, doubtfully; for while in his secret heart he was flattered, his paternal feeling started a scruple hard to distinguish from fear.</p> 
<p>A light shone brightly in the eyes of the elder Jew, and his head arose.</p> 
<p>"Humble!" he said. "She is a daughter of Israel, an inheritor of the favor of the Lord God, to whom all things are possible. He keeps the destinies of his people. He--not thou or I--knows to what this little one may come. As we love her, let us hope the happiest and the highest, and prepare her for it. To this end it were best you allow her to come to me as to another father. I who teach the deaf and dumb to speak--Syama and Nilo the elder--will make her a scholar such as does not often grace a palace. She shall speak the Mediterranean tongues. There shall be no mysteries of India unknown to her. Mathematics shall bring the heavens to her feet. Especially shall she become wise in the Chronicles of God. At the same time, lest she be educated into unfitness for the present conditions of life, and be unsexed, thou shalt find a woman familiar with society, and instal her in thy house as governess and example. If the woman be also of Israel, so much the better; for then we may expect faithfulness without jealousy. And further, son of Jahdai, be niggardly in nothing concerning our Lael. Clothe her as she were the King's daughter. At going abroad, which she shall do with me in the street and on the water, I would have her sparkle with jewels, the observed of everybody, even the Emperor. And ask not doubtingly, 'Whence the money for all this?' I will find it. What sayest thou now?"</p> 
<p>Uel did not hesitate.</p> 
<p>"O Prince, as thou dost these things for her--so far beyond the best I can dream of--take her for thine, not less than mine."</p> 
<p>With a beaming countenance, the elder raised the child, and kissed her on the forehead.</p> 
<p>"Dost hear?" he said to her. "Now art thou my daughter."</p> 
<p>She put her arms about his neck, then held them out to Uel, who took her, and kissed her, saying:</p> 
<p>"Oh my Gul Bahar!"</p> 
<p>"Good!" cried the Prince. "I accept the name. To distinguish the living from the dead, I too will call her my Gul Bahar."</p> 
<p>Thereupon the men sat, and arranged the new relation, omitting nothing possible of anticipation.</p> 
<p>Next day the Prince's house was opened with every privilege to the child. A little later on a woman of courtly accomplishment was found and established under Uel's roof as governess. Thereupon the Mystic entered upon a season during which he forgot the judgment upon him, and all else save Gul Bahar, and the scheme he brought from Cipango. He was for the time as other men. In the lavishment of his love, richer of its long accumulation, he was faithful to his duty of teacher, and was amply rewarded by her progress in study.</p>
