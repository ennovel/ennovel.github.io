<br> 
<br> I was curious. I had heard a great deal of her beauty; and it had exceeded all I heard; so I talked my sublimest and brightest chit-chat, in my most musical tones, and was rather engaging and amusing, I ventured to hope. But the best man cannot manage a dialogue alone. Miss Brandon was plainly not a person to make any sort of exertion towards what is termed keeping up a conversation; at all events she did not, and after a while the present one got into a decidedly sinking condition. An acquiescence, a faint expression of surprise, a fainter smile — she contributed little more, after the first few questions of courtesy had been asked, in her low silvery tones, and answered by me. To me the natural demise of a tête-à-tête discourse has always seemed a disgrace. But this apathetic beauty had either more moral courage or more stupidity than I, and was plainly terribly indifferent about the catastrophe. I’ve sometimes thought my struggles and sinkings amused her cruel serenity.
<br> 
<br> Bella ma stupida! — I experienced, at last, the sort of pique with which George Sand’s hero apostrophises la derniere Aldini. Yet I could not think her stupid. The universal instinct honours beauty. It is so difficult to believe it either dull or base. In virtue of some mysterious harmonies it is ‘the image of God,’ and must, we feel, enclose the God-like; so I suppose I felt, for though I wished to think her stupid, I could not. She was not exactly languid, but a grave and listless beauty, and a splendid beauty for all that.
<br> 
<br> I told her my early recollections of Brandon and Gylingden, and how I remembered her a baby, and said some graceful trifles on that theme, which I fancied were likely to please. But they were only received, and led to nothing. In a little while in comes Lord Chelford, always natural and pleasant, and quite unconscious of his peerage — he was above it, I think — and chatted away merrily with that handsome animated blonde — who on earth, could she be? — and did not seem the least chilled in the stiff and frosted presence of his mother, but was genial and playful even with that Spirit of the Frozen Ocean, who received his affectionate trifling with a sort of smiling, though wintry pride and complacency, reflecting back from her icy aspects something of the rosy tints of that kindly sunshine.
<br> 
<br> I thought I heard him call the young lady Miss Lake, and there rose before me an image of an old General Lake, and a dim recollection of some reverse of fortune. He was — I was sure of that — connected with the Brandon family; and was, with the usual fatality, a bit of a mauvais sujet. He had made away with his children’s money, or squandered his own; or somehow or another impoverished his family not creditably. So I glanced at her, and Miss Brandon divined, it seemed, what was passing in my mind, for she said:—
<br> 
<br> ‘That is my cousin, Miss Lake, and I think her very beautiful — don’t you?’
<br> 
<br> ‘Yes, she certainly is very handsome,’ and I was going to say something about her animation and spirit, but remembered just in time, that that line of eulogy would hardly have involved a compliment to Miss Brandon. ‘I know her brother, a little — that is, Captain Lake — Stanley Lake; he’s her brother, I fancy?’
<br> 
<br> ‘Oh?‘ said the young lady, in that tone which is pointed with an unknown accent, between a note of enquiry and of surprise. ‘Yes; he’s her brother.’
<br> 
<br> And she paused; as if something more were expected. But at that moment the bland tones of Larcom, the solemn butler, announced the Rev. William Wylder and Mrs. Wylder, and I said —
<br> 
<br> ‘William is an old college friend of mine;’ and I observed him, as he entered with an affectionate and sad sort of interest. Eight years had passed since we met last, and that is something at any time. It had thinned my simple friend’s hair a little, and his face, too, was more careworn than I liked, but his earnest, sweet smile was there still. Slight, gentle, with something of a pale and studious refinement in his face. The same gentle voice, with that slight, occasional hesitation, which somehow I liked. There is always a little shock after an absence of some years before identities adjust themselves, and then we find the change is not, after all, so very great. I suspect it is, rather, that something of the old picture is obliterated, in that little interval, to return no more. And so William Wylder was vicar now instead of that straight wiry cleric of the mulberry face and black leggings.
<br> 
<br> And who was this little Mrs. William Wylder who came in, so homely of feature, so radiant of goodhumour, so eager and simple, in a very plain dress — a Brandon housemaid would not have been seen in it, leaning so pleasantly on his lean, long, clerical arm — made for reaching books down from high shelves, a lank, scholarlike limb, with a somewhat threadbare cuff — and who looked round with that anticipation of pleasure, and that simple confidence in a real welcome, which are so likely to insure it? Was she an helpmeet for a black-letter man, who talked with the Fathers in his daily walks, could extemporise Latin hexameters, and dream in Greek. Was she very wise, or at all learned? I think her knowledge lay chiefly in the matters of poultry, and puddings, and latterly, of the nursery, where one treasure lay — that golden-haired little boy, four years old, whom I had seen playing among the roses before the parsonage door, asleep by this time — half-past seven, ‘precise,’ as old Lady Chelford loved to write on her summons to dinner.
<br> 
<br> When the vicar, I dare say, in a very odd, quaint way, made his proposal of marriage, moved thereto assuredly, neither by fortune, nor by beauty, to good, merry, little Miss Dorothy Chubley, whom nobody was supposed to be looking after, and the town had, somehow, set down from the first as a natural-born old maid — there was a very general amazement; some disappointment here and there, with customary sneers and compassion, and a good deal of genuine amusement not ill-natured.
<br> 
<br> Miss Chubley, all the shopkeepers in the town knew and liked, and, in a way, respected her, as ‘Miss Dolly.’ Old Reverend John Chubley, D.D., who had been in love with his wife from the period of his boyhood; and yet so grudging was Fate, had to undergo an engagement of nigh thirty years before Hymen rewarded their constancy; being at length made Vicar of Huddelston, and master of church revenues to the amount of three hundred pounds a year — had, at forty-five, married his early love, now forty-two.
<br> 
<br> They had never grown old in one another’s fond eyes. Their fidelity was of the days of chivalry, and their simplicity comical and beautiful. Twenty years of happy and loving life were allotted them and one pledge — poor Miss Dorothy — was left alone, when little more than nineteen years old. This good old couple, having loved early and waited long, and lived together with wonderful tenderness and gaiety of heart their allotted span, bid farewell for a little while — the gentle little lady going first, and, in about two years more, the good rector following.
<br> 
<br> I remembered him, but more dimly than his merry little wife, though she went first. She made raisin-wine, and those curious biscuits that tasted of Windsor soap.
<br> 
<br> And this Mrs. William Wylder just announced by soft-toned Larcom, is the daughter (there is no mistaking the jolly smile and lumpy odd little features, and radiance of amiability) of the good doctor and Mrs. Chubley, so curiously blended in her loving face. And last comes in old Major Jackson, smiling largely, squaring himself, and doing his courtesies in a firm but florid military style, and plainly pleased to find himself in good company and on the eve of a good dinner. And so our dinner-list is full.
<br> 
<br> The party were just nine — and it is wonderful what a row nine well-behaved people will contrive to make at a dinner-table. The inferior animals — as we see them caged and cared for, and fed at one o’clock, ‘precise,’ in those public institutions provided for their maintenance — confine their uproar to the period immediately antecedent to their meal, and perform the actual process of deglutition with silent attention, and only such suckings, lappings, and crunchings, as illustrate their industry and content. It is the distinctive privilege of man to exert his voice during his repast, and to indulge also in those specially human cachinnations which no lower creature, except that disreputable Australian biped known as the ‘laughing jackass,’ presumes to imitate; and to these vocal exercises of the feasters respond the endless ring and tinkle of knife and fork on china plate, and the ministering angels in white chokers behind the chairs, those murmured solicitations which hum round and round the ears of the revellers.
<br> 
<br> Of course, when great guns are present, and people talk pro bono publico, one at a time, with parliamentary regularity, things are different; but at an ordinary symposium, when the garrulous and diffident make merry together, and people break into twos or threes and talk across the table, or into their neighbours’ ears, and all together, the noise is not only exhilarating and peculiar, but sometimes perfectly unaccountable.
<br> 
<br> The talk, of course, has its paroxysms and its subsidences. I have once or twice found myself on a sudden in total silence in the middle of a somewhat prolix, though humorous story, commenced in an uproar for the sole recreation of my pretty neighbour, and ended — patched up, renounced — a faltering failure, under the converging gaze of a sternly attentive audience.
<br> 
<br> On the other hand, there are moments when the uproar whirls up in a crescendo to a pitch and volume perfectly amazing; and at such times, I believe that anyone might say anything to the reveller at his elbow, without the smallest risk of being overheard by mortal. You may plan with young Caesar Borgia, on your left, the poisoning of your host; or ask pretty Mrs. Fusible, on your right, to elope with you from her grinning and gabbling lord, whose bald head flashes red with champagne only at the other side of the table. There is no privacy like it; you may plot your wickedness, or make your confession, or pop the question, and not a soul but your confidant be a bit the wiser — provided only you command your countenance.
<br> 
<br> I don’t know how it happened, but Wylder sat beside Miss Lake. I fancied he ought to have been differently placed, but Miss Brandon did not seem conscious of his absence, and it seemed to me that the handsome blonde would have been as well pleased if he had been anywhere but where he was. There was no look of liking, though some faint glimmerings both of annoyance and embarrassment in her face. But in Wylder’s I saw a sort of conceited consciousness, and a certain eagerness, too, while he talked; though a shrewd fellow in many ways, he had a secret conviction that no woman could resist him.
<br> 
<br> ‘I suppose the world thinks me a very happy fellow, Miss Lake?’ he said, with a rather pensive glance of enquiry into that young lady’s eyes, as he set down his hock-glass.
<br> 
<br> ‘I’m afraid it’s a selfish world, Mr. Wylder, and thinks very little of what does not concern it.’
<br> 
<br> ‘Now, you, I dare say,’ continued Wylder, not caring to perceive the soup?on of sarcasm that modulated her answer so musically, ‘look upon me as a very fortunate fellow?’
<br> 
<br> ‘You are a very fortunate person, Mr. Wylder; a gentleman of very moderate abilities, with no prospects, and without fortune, who finds himself, without any deservings of his own, on a sudden, possessed of an estate, and about to be united to the most beautiful heiress in England, is, I think, rather a fortunate person.’
<br> 
<br> ‘You did not always think me so stupid, Miss Lake,’ said Mr. Wylder, showing something of the hectic of vexation.
<br> 
<br> ‘Stupid! did I say? Well, you know, we learn by experience, Mr. Wylder. One’s judgment matures, and we are harder to please — don’t you think so? — as we grow older.’
<br> 
<br> ‘Aye, so we are, I dare say; at any rate, some things don’t please us as we calculated. I remember when this bit of luck would have made me a devilish happy fellow — twice as happy; but, you see, if a fellow hasn’t his liberty, where’s the good of money? I don’t know how I got into it, but I can’t get away now; and the lawyer fellows, and trustees, and all that sort of prudent people, get about one, and persuade, and exhort, and they bully you, by Jove! into what they call a marriage of convenience — I forget the French word — you know; and then, you see, your feelings may be very different, and all that; and where’s the good of money, I say, if you can’t enjoy it?’
<br> 
<br> And Mr. Wylder looked poetically unhappy, and trundled over a little bit of fricandeau on his plate with his fork, desolately, as though earthly things had lost their relish.
<br> 
<br> ‘Yes; I think I know the feeling,’ said Miss Lake, quietly. ‘That ballad, you know, expresses it very prettily:—“Oh, thou hast been the cause of this anguish, my mother?”’
<br> 
<br> It was not then as old a song as it is now.
<br> 
<br> Wylder looked sharply at her, but she did not smile, and seemed to speak in good faith; and being somewhat thick in some matters, though a cunning fellow, he said —
<br> 
<br> ‘Yes; that is the sort of thing, you know — of course, with a difference — a girl is supposed to speak there; but men suffer that way, too — though, of course, very likely it’s more their own fault.’
<br> 
<br> ‘It is very sad,’ said Miss Lake, who was busy with a paté.
<br> 
<br> ‘She has no life in her; she’s a mere figurehead; she’s awfully slow; I don’t like black hair; I’m taken by conversation — and all that. There are some men that can only really love once in their lives, and never forget their first love, I assure you.’
<br> 
<br> Wylder murmured all this, and looked as plaintive as he could without exciting the attention of the people over-the-way.
<br> 
<br> Mark Wylder had, as you perceive, rather vague notions of decency, and not much experience of ladies; and thought he was making just the interesting impression he meditated. He was a good deal surprised, then, when Miss Lake said, and with quite a cheerful countenance, and very quickly, but so that her words stung his ear like the prick of a bodkin.
<br> 
<br> ‘Your way of speaking of my cousin, Sir, is in the highest degree discreditable to you and offensive to me, and should you venture to repeat it, I will certainly mention it to Lady Chelford.’
<br> 
<br> And so she turned to old Major Jackson at her right, who had been expounding a point of the battle of Vittoria to Lord Chelford; and she led him again into action, and acquired during the next ten minutes a great deal of curious lore about Spanish muleteers and French prisoners, together with some particulars about the nature of picket duty, and ‘that scoundrel, Castanos.’
