They would cheat on their Latin tests like they always did—amo, amas, amat was still tattooed on the inside of Serena’s elbow in permanent marker (thank God for three-quarter length sleeves!). They’d drive around Serena’s parents’ estate in Ridgefield, Connecticut, in the caretaker’s old Buick station wagon, singing the stupid hymns they sang in school and acting like crazy old ladies. They’d pee in the downstairs entrances to their classmates’ brownstones and then ring the doorbells and run away. They’d take Blair’s little brother, Tyler, to the Lower East Side and leave him there to see how long it took for him to find his way home—a work of charity, really, since Tyler was now the most street-wise boy at St. George’s. They’d go out dancing with a huge group and lose ten pounds just from sweating in their leather pants. As if they needed to lose the weight. They would go back to being their regular old fabulous selves, just like always. Serena couldn’t wait. “Got you a drink,” Chuck Bass said, elbowing the clusters of parents out of the way and handing Serena a tumbler of whiskey. “Welcome back,” he added, ducking down to kiss Serena’s cheek and missing it intentionally, so that his lips landed on her mouth. “You haven’t changed,” Serena said, accepting the drink. She took a long sip. “So, did you miss me?” “Miss you? The question is, did you miss me?” Chuck said. “Come on, babe, spill. What are you doing back here? What happened? Do you have a boyfriend?” “Oh, come on, Chuck,” Serena said, squeezing his hand. “You know I came back because I want you so badly. I’ve always wanted you.” Chuck took a step back and cleared his throat, his face flushed. She’d caught him off guard, a rare feat. “Well, I’m all booked up for this month, but I can put you on the waiting list,” Chuck said huffily, trying to regain his composure. But Serena was barely listening to him anymore. Her dark blue eyes scanned the room, looking for the two people she wanted to see most, Blair and Nate. Finally Serena found them. Nate was standing by the doorway to the hall, and Blair was standing just behind him, her head bowed, fiddling with the buttons on her black cardigan. Nate was looking directly at Serena, and when her gaze met his, he bit his bottom lip the way he always did when he was embarrassed. And then he smiled. That smile. Those eyes. That face. “Come here,” Serena mouthed at him, waving her hand. Her heart sped up as Nate began walking toward her. He looked better than she remembered, much better. Nate’s heart was beating even faster than hers. “Hey, you,” Serena breathed when Nate hugged her. He smelled just like he always smelled. Like the cleanest, most delicious boy alive. Tears came to Serena’s eyes and she pressed her face into Nate’s chest. Now she was really home. Nate’s cheeks turned pink. Calm down, he told himself. But he couldn’t calm down. He felt like picking her up and twirling her around and kissing her face over and over. “I love you!” he wanted to shout, but he didn’t. He couldn’t. Nate was the only son of a navy captain and a French society hostess. His father was a master sailor and extremely handsome, but a little lacking in the hugs department. His mother was the complete opposite, always fawning over Nate and prone to emotional fits during which she would lock herself in her bedroom with a bottle of champagne and call her sister on her yacht in Monaco. Poor Nate was always on the verge of saying how he really felt, but he didn’t want to make a scene or say something he might regret later. Instead, he kept quiet and let other people steer the boat, while he laid back and enjoyed the steady rocking of the waves. He might look like a stud, but he was actually pretty weak. “So, what have you been up to?” Nate asked Serena, trying to breathe normally. “We missed you.” Notice that he wasn’t even brave enough to say, “I missed you”? “What have I been up to?” Serena repeated. She giggled. “If you only knew, Nate. I’ve been so, so bad!” Nate clenched his fists involuntarily. Man oh man, had he missed her. Ignored as usual, Chuck slunk away from Serena and Nate and crossed the room to Blair, who was once again standing with Kati and Isabel. “A thousand bucks says she got kicked out,” Chuck told them. “And doesn’t she look fucked? I think she’s been thoroughly fucked. Maybe she had some sort of prostitution ring going on up there. The Merry Madam of Hanover Academy,” he added, laughing at his own stupid joke. “I think she looks kind of spaced out, too,” Kati said. “Maybe she’s on heroin.” “Or some prescription drug,” Isabel said. “You know, like, Valium or Prozac. Maybe she’s gone totally nuts.” “She could’ve been making her own E,” Kati agreed. “She was always good at science.” “I heard she joined some kind of cult,” Chuck offered. “Like, she’s been brainwashed and now all she thinks about is sex and she like, has to do it all the time.” When is dinner going to be ready? Blair wondered, tuning out her friends’ ridiculous speculations. She had forgotten how pretty Serena’s hair was. How perfect her skin was. How long and thin her legs were. What Nate’s eyes looked like when he looked at her—like he never wanted to blink. He never looked at Blair that way. “Hey Blair, Serena must have told you she was coming back,” Chuck said. “Come on, tell us. What’s the deal?” Blair stared back at him blankly, her small, fox-like face turning red. The truth was, she hadn’t really spoken to Serena in over a year. At first, when Serena had gone to boarding school after sophomore year, Blair had really missed her. But it soon became apparent how much easier it was to shine without Serena around. Suddenly Blair was the prettiest, the smartest, the hippest, most happening girl in the room. She became the one everyone looked to. So Blair stopped missing Serena so much. She’d felt a little guilty for not staying in touch, but even that had worn off when she’d received Serena’s flip and impersonal e-mails describing all the fun she was having at boarding school. “Hitchhiked to Vermont to go snowboarding and spent the nightdancing with the hottest guys!” “Crazy night last night. Damn, my head hurts!” The last news Blair had received was a postcard this past summer: “Blair: Turned seventeen on Bastille Day. France rocks!! Miss you!!!
