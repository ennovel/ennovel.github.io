She couldn’t believe she’d gotten two sandwiches. Serena probably thought she was a disgusting pig. “Well, I’m pretty artistic. I did the school hymnals, you know, in calligraphy? And I’ve got some photographs in Rancor this year, and a short story,” Jenny explained. Rancor was Constance’s student-run arts magazine. Vanessa Abrams was the editor. “Oh, and I just did the invitations for that big party next week that everyone’s going to,” Jenny said, eager to impress. “Blair Waldorf asked me to do them. Actually . . .” Jenny reached into her bag and pulled out an envelope with Serena’s name printed on it in ornate calligraphy. “The guest list Blair gave me still had your boarding school address. I was going to put it in your locker or something,” Jenny said, blushing. “But now that you’re here . . .” She handed the envelope to Serena. Do I sound like a stalker? Jenny wondered. “Thanks,” Serena said, taking the envelope. She opened it and read the invitation inside, her eyes dark, her forehead creased in a frown. Oh, God. She thinks it’s ugly! Jenny thought, panicking. Serena put the invitation in her bag and picked up her fork again, looking distracted. She took a bite of lettuce and chewed on it. Jenny was taking mental notes on how to act as mysterious, poised, and cool as Serena was acting at that very moment. If only she could have heard the livid thoughts in Serena’s head, railing against Blair. She didn’t want me to come to the party. She didn’t even tell methere was a party.
<br> “Wow,” Serena said finally, still munching her lettuce. “Okay, you’re hired.” She held out her hand and smiled sweetly at Jenny. “I’m Serena,” she said. “I know,” Jenny said, blushing even redder. “I’m Jenny.” Disclaimer: All the real names of places, people, and events havebeen altered or abbreviated to protect the innocent.

<br> S AND B: HOT IN THE HOT TUB! This just in from an anonymous source: Apparently, back when they were still tight, S and B shared a hot hot-tub moment together in C’s suite in the Tribeca Star. Was the kiss an expression of their true feelings for each other? Or were they just messing around like two silly drunk girls? Either way, it definitely adds a little tension to the mix. What fun! And in case you haven’t seen the poster plastered on all the buses, taxis, and subways all over town, the original photo of S can still be seen at the Whitehot Gallery in Chelsea, amidst portraits of other notorious scenesters, myself included. That’s right! The Remi brothers were just too sexy to resist. The fabulous are fabulous for a reason, people.
