I really love their work, and I love the picture they took of me, but no way would I let them put it on the side of a bus. If you ask me, S is asking for whatever she gets. And from what I’m hearing, she’s getting it.—Anonomy Dear Anonomy, It’s cool to be modest, but personally, if you wanted to put any bit of me on the side of a bus, I’d be willing. I’m a fame whore.—GG SightingsLittle J buying a huge book on filmmaking at Shakespeare and Co. on Broadway. N hanging out with C at a bar over on First Avenue. Guess N wants to keep his eye on C so C doesn’t spill the beans, huh? And B buying lots of candles in a shop on Lex for her big night with N. That’s all for now. Have fun this weekend—I definitely will. You know you love me, The Star Lounge in the Tribeca Star Hotel was big and swanky, filled with comfy armchairs and ottomans and circular banquettes, so that the guests could feel like they were having their own private party at each table. One wall was lit with dozens of black candles, flickering in the dimly lit room, and a DJ was playing mellow lounge beats on a turntable. It was only eight o’clock, but the bar was already jammed with people, dressed in the hippest fashions and sipping pastel-colored cocktails. Blair didn’t care what time it was—she needed a drink. She was sitting in an armchair right near the bar, but the stupid cocktail waitress was ignoring her, probably because Blair hadn’t bothered to dress up. She had worn her faded Earl jeans and a boring black sweater because she was only meeting Serena for a quick drink before she went home to prepare for her night of wild sex with Nate. And she wasn’t going to dress up for that, either. Blair had decided to meet Nate at the door naked. Her face grew hot just thinking about it, and she looked around the room self-consciously. She felt like a loser sitting there all by herself without even a drink. Where was Serena, anyway? She didn’t have all goddamned night. Blair lit a cigarette. If Serena doesn’t come by the time I’m donewith this cigarette, I’m leaving, she told herself sulkily. “Look at her,” Blair heard a woman say to her friend. “Isn’t she beautiful?” Blair turned to look. Of course it was Serena. She was wearing blue suede knee-high boots and a real Pucci dress. Long sleeved with a high neck and a crystal beaded belt, in blues, oranges, and greens. It was super fantastic. Her hair was pulled up in a high ponytail on top of her head and she was wearing pale blue eye shadow and creamy pink lipstick. She smiled and waved at Blair from across the room, weaving her way through the crowd. Blair watched the heads turn as she passed, and her stomach churned. She was already sick of Serena, and she hadn’t even spoken to her yet. “Hi,” Serena said, plunking herself down on a square ottoman beside Blair’s chair. Immediately, the cocktail waitress appeared. “Hey Serena, long time no see. How’s your brother?” the waitress said. “Hey Missy. Erik’s good. He’s too busy to call me ever. I think he must have like, eight different girlfriends up there,” Serena laughed. “How are you doing?” “I’m great,” Missy said. “Hey listen, my sister works for a caterer, you know, and she said she saw you a few days ago at a party she was working at a gallery in Chelsea. She said that’s you in that picture on all the buses. Is that true?” “Yeah,” Serena said. “Pretty crazy, huh?” “You are so rad!” Missy squealed. She glanced at Blair who was glaring at her. “Anyway, what can I get you girls?” “Ketel One and tonic,” Blair told her, looking her straight in the eye, daring her to card them. “Extra limes.” But Missy would rather lose her job than hassle Serena van der Woodsen for being underage. That’s the whole reason for going to hotel bars in the first place: no one ever cards. “And for you, sweetie?” Missy asked Serena. “Oh, I better start with a Cosmo,” Serena said, and laughed. “I need something pink to go with my dress.” Missy hurried away to fetch the drinks, eager to tell the bartender that the girl in the Remi brothers’ photo that was all over town was sitting in their bar and they were pals! “Sorry I’m late,” Serena told Blair, looking around. “I thought everyone else would be here with you.” Blair shrugged her shoulders and took a long drag on her dwindling cigarette. “I thought we could hang out by ourselves for a while,” she said. “No one really comes out until later, anyway.” “Okay,” Serena said. She smoothed out her dress and dug around in her little red purse for her own pack of cigarettes. Gauloises, from France. She tapped one out and stuck it in her mouth. “Want one?” she offered Blair. Blair shook her head no. “They’re kind of strong, but the box is too cool, I don’t care.” Serena laughed. She was about to light up with a pack of bar matches, when the bartender swooped in with a lighter. “Thanks,” she said, raising her eyes to look at him. The bartender winked at her and swiftly stepped back behind the bar. Missy brought them their drinks. “To old times,” Serena said, clinking her glass against Blair’s and taking a long sip on her pink Cosmopolitan. She sat back on her stool and sighed with pleasure. “Don’t you just love hotels?” she said. “They’re so full of secrets.” Blair raised her eyebrows at Serena in silent response, sure that Serena was about to tell her all the wild and crazy things that had happened to her in hotels while she was in Europe or wherever, as if Blair cared. “I mean, don’t you always think about what everyone’s doing in their rooms? Like, they could be watching pornos and eating cheese doodles, or they could be having kinky sex in the bathroom. Or maybe they’re just asleep.” “Uh-huh,” said Blair disinterestedly, gulping her drink. She would have to get a little drunk if she were going to make it through the night, especially the naked part. “So what’s this about your picture being all over buses and stuff?” Blair said. “I haven’t seen it.” Serena giggled and leaned toward Blair confidentially. “Even if you saw it, you probably wouldn’t recognize me. It has my name on it, but it’s not a picture of my face.” Blair frowned. “I don’t get it,” she said. “It’s art,” Serena said mysteriously, and giggled again. She took a sip of her drink. The two girls’ faces were only inches apart, and Blair could smell the musky essential-oil mixture Serena had started wearing. “I still don’t get it. Is it something dirty?” Blair said, confused. “Not really,” Serena answered with a sly smile. “Lots of people have had theirs done too. You know—celebrities.” “Like who?” Blair said. “Like Madonna, and Eminem, and Christina Aguilera.” “Oh,” Blair said, sounding unimpressed. Serena’s eyes narrowed. “What’s that supposed to mean?” she demanded. Blair lifted her chin and tucked her straight brown hair behind her ears. “I don’t know, it’s like you’re willing to do anything just to shock people. Don’t you have any pride?” Serena shook her head, still staring at Blair. “Like what? What have I done?” she said, frantically gnawing on her fingernails. “Like getting kicked out of boarding school,” Blair said vaguely. Serena snorted. “What’s so bad about that? Tons of people get kicked out every year. They have so many stupid rules, it’s almost impossible not to get kicked out.” Blair pressed her lips together, measuring her words carefully. “I don’t mean that, I mean why you got kicked out.” There. She had done it. She had committed herself now. She was going to have to sit and listen to Serena tell her all about the cults she had joined, and the boys she’d had sex with, and the drugs she had done. Shit. Don’t believe for a minute that she wasn’t curious, though. Blair fiddled with the ruby ring on her finger, turning it round and round. Serena raised her glass at Missy, asking for another drink. “Blair,” Serena said. “The only reason I got kicked out was because I didn’t show up at the beginning of school. I stayed in France. My parents didn’t even know. I was supposed to fly back at the end of August, but I stayed until the third week in September. I was living in this amazing chateau outside of Cannes, and it was like, a constant party. I don’t think I slept a whole night the entire time I was there. It was like those parties in that house in The Great Gatsby. “There were these two boys, an older brother and a younger one, and I was totally in love with both of them. Actually,” she laughed, “I was even more in love with their father, but he was married.” The Star Lounge DJ switched vibes and began to play a funky acid jazz song with a cool beat. The lights dimmed and the candles flickered. Serena jiggled her foot to the music and glanced at Blair, whose eyes were glazing over. Serena lit another cigarette and inhaled deeply. “Anyway, of course I partied a lot at school, but so did everyone else. What the school couldn’t deal with was that I didn’t even bother to show up at the beginning of the year. I don’t blame them, I guess. But to tell you the truth, I really didn’t care about going back to school. I was having way too much fun.” Blair rolled her eyes again. She honestly didn’t care what the truth was. “Did you ever think about the fact that these are like, the most important years of our lives? Like, for getting into college and everything?” she said. Missy brought Serena’s drink, and this time Serena only nodded her thanks. She looked down at the floor, her pinky nail between her teeth. “Yeah, I’m just realizing that now,” she admitted. “I hadn’t thought about it before—how I should have been joining teams and clubs. You know, getting really into the school thing.” Blair shook her head. “I feel sorry for your parents,” she said quietly. Serena’s eyes were getting big, and her lip was trembling. But she was determined not to let Blair make her cry. Blair was just being a bitch, that’s all. Maybe she was getting her period. Serena took a huge gulp of her drink and wiped her mouth with her cocktail napkin. “So, you never told me what you and Nate did all summer. Did you ever go up to Maine and see that boat he built?” she asked, completely changing the subject. Blair shook her head. “I had tennis camp. It sucked.” “Oh,” Serena said. They drank their drinks in awkward silence. Serena sat up suddenly, remembering something. “Hey,” she said. “You know, some girl actually signed up to help me with my movie? A ninth grader. Her name is Jenny. And she gave me an invitation to that party next week. You know, the one you’ve been planning?” Touché, girlfriend. Touché. Blair pulled another cigarette out of the pack and stuck it in her mouth. She reached for a match, pausing before she struck it to see if the bartender would leap across the room with a lighter. He didn’t. Blair lit the cigarette herself and blew a big cloud of smoke directly into Serena’s face. So Serena knew about the party. She had an invitation. Well, she was bound to find out anyway. “The calligrapher,” Blair said, smiling sweetly. “She’s good, isn’t she?” “Yeah, she did a great job,” Serena said. “And it was really nice of her to notice that mine had the wrong address on it. She said the address you gave her was my dorm room at Hanover.” Blair tucked her hair behind her ears and shrugged her shoulders. “Oops,” she said, feigning cluelessness. “Sorry about that.” “So tell me about the party,” Serena said. “What’s it for again?” Blair couldn’t talk about the cause without smiling self-consciously because it sounded so lame and unsexy. That’s why she’d named the party Kiss on the Lips. To give it some allure. “It’s for those two peregrine falcons that live in Central Park. They’re an endangered species, and everyone’s worried that they’re going to die or starve or the squirrels will raid their nests or whatever.
