Serena sighed and flicked a piece of lettuce off her plate. Blair was being boring. When were they going to start having fun? She looked up at Kati and Isabel hopefully, but they were getting ready to leave, too. “I’ve got a stupid college advisor meeting,” Kati said. “And I have to go up to the art room and put my painting away,” Isabel said. “Before anyone sees it?” Kati joked. “Oh, shut up,” Isabel said. They stood up with their trays. “It’s so good to have you back, Serena,” Kati said in her fakest voice. “Yeah,” Isabel agreed. “It really is.” And then they walked away. Serena twirled her spoon around and around in her yogurt container, wondering what had happened to everyone. They were all acting like freaks. What did I do? she asked herself, chewing on her thumbnail again. Good question. Disclaimer: All the real names of places, people, and events havebeen altered or abbreviated to protect the innocent.

<br> hey people!
<br> WHERE THE BOYS ARE Thanks for checking in, although most of you had little to say aboutS or B. Most of you just want to know more about the boys.
<br> Your E-mail: Dear gg, D sounds sweet. Whats he so hot for S for? Shes just a ho. —Bebe Dear Bebe, I happen to know that D is not that innocent. He was up to some kinky shit back at summer camp in eighth grade. —GG dear GG, what does N do at lunchtime?? i go to school near him, and i wonder if i see him all the time without realizing it. Yikes! — ShyGirl Okay, if you want to know so badly, then I’ll tell you. St. Jude’s lets its senior boys out for lunch. So right now N is probably headed up to that little pizza joint on the corner of Eightieth and Madison. Vino’s? Vinnie’s? Whatever. Anyway, they have good slices and one of the delivery guys sells pretty decent pot. N is one of his regulars. There’s usually a group of kids from L’Ecole standing around outside the pizza place, so N will stop and flirt with this one girl who I’ll call Claire, who acts all shy and pretends she doesn’t speak English, but she’s actually really bad at French and a huge slut.
<br> N has this cute little gag where he buys two slices and he always offers Claire one. She holds onto it the whole time they’re talking and finally takes a little weeny bit off the tip of the slice. Then N goes, “I can’t believe you did that, you’re eating my pizza!” and swipes the thing out of her hands and eats the whole thing in like two bites. This makes Claire laugh so hard her boobs nearly pop out of her shirt. The L’Ecole girls all wear really tight clothes and short skirts and high heels. They’re like, the ho’s of the Upper East Side school system. N likes to flirt with them, and so far that’s as far as it’s gone. But if B leads him on any longer, he might start giving Claire more than just a bite of his pizza. This time, though, Claire surprises him by asking if he’s heard about S . Claire claims to have heard that S not only got pregnant last year, but that she gave birth in France. Her baby’s name is Jules and he is alive and well and living in Marseilles. As for D—well, he’s sitting outside in the Riverside Prep courtyard again, reading poetry and eating PB and J. I know that sounds extremely sad, but don’t worry about D. His time is coming. Stay tuned. SightingsK was seen returning a pink, army-print handbag at Barneys.
<br> Personally, I thought the bag was cute. But someone must have talked her out of it. You know you love me, “Hey Nate. It’s Serena. I’m just calling to see what you’re up to. I thought maybe we could go out tonight, but you know what? I’m tired. It’s only ten, but I think I’m going to bed. I’ll see you this weekend though, okay? I can’t wait. Love you. Nighty-night.” Serena hung up. Her room felt very quiet. Even Fifth Avenue was still, except for the occasional passing taxi. From where she sat on her big canopy bed, she could see the silver-framed photograph of her family, taken in Greece when she was twelve. The captain of the sailboat they’d chartered had taken the picture. They were all in bathing suits, and her brother, Erik, who was fourteen at the time, was making a big fart kiss on Serena’s cheek while their parents looked on, laughing. Serena had gotten her period for the first time on that trip. She’d been so embarrassed, she couldn’t bear to tell her parents, but what was she supposed to do, trapped on a boat? They were anchored off the island of Rhodes, and while their parents were snorkeling and Serena and Erik were supposed to be having windsurfing lessons, Erik had swum ashore, stolen a Vespa, and bought her some maxi pads. He came back with them in a little plastic bag, tied on top of his head, her hero. Serena had thrown her ruined underwear overboard. They were probably still there, stuck on a reef somewhere. Now Erik was a freshman at Brown, and Serena never got to see him. He had been in France with her that summer, but they’d both spent the whole time chasing or being chased by boys and girls, so they’d never really had time to talk. Serena picked up the phone again and pressed the speed-dial button for her brother’s off-campus apartment. The phone rang and rang until finally the voicemail system picked up. “If you would like to leave a message for Dillon, press one. If you would like to leave a message for Tim, press two. If you would like to leave a message for Drew, press three. If you would like to leave a message for Erik, press four.” Serena pressed four and then hesitated. “ . . . Hey . . . it’s Serena. Sorry I haven’t called in a while. But you could have called me too, you big jerk. I was stuck up in Ridgefield, bored out of my mind, until this weekend, and now I’m back in the city. I had my first day of school today. It was kind of strange. Actually it sucked. Everyone is . . . everything is . . . I don’t know . . . it’s weird. . . . Anyway, call me. I miss your hairy ass. I’ll send you a care-package as soon as I get a chance. Love you. Bye.” “You’re so full of shit, Dan,” Jenny Humphrey told her brother. They were sitting at the kitchen table in their large and crumbling tenth-floor, four-bedroom West End Avenue apartment. It was a beautiful old place with twelve-foot ceilings, lots of sunny windows, big walk-in closets, and huge bathtubs with feet, but it hadn’t been renovated since the 1940s. The walls were waterstained and cracked, and the wood floors were scratched and dull. Ancient, mammoth dust bunnies had gathered in the corners and along the baseboards like moss. Once in a while Jenny and Dan’s father, Rufus Humphrey, hired a cleaning service to scrub the place down, and their enormous cat, Marx, kept the cockroaches in order, but most of the time their home felt like a cozy, neglected attic. It was the kind of place where you’d expect to find lost treasures like ancient photographs, vintage shoes, or a bone from last year’s Christmas dinner. Jenny was eating half a grapefruit and drinking a cup of peppermint tea. Ever since she’d gotten her period last spring, she’d been eating less and less. Everything she ate went straight to her boobs, anyway. Dan worried about his little sister’s eating habits, but Jenny was as spunky and energetic as ever, so what did he know? For instance, he didn’t know that Jenny bought a toasted, buttered, chocolate-chip scone almost every day on her way to school at a little gourmet deli on Broadway. Not exactly a great strategy for breast reduction. Dan was eating an Entenmann’s chocolate donut—his second—and sipping instant coffee with Coffee-mate and four teaspoons of sugar. He liked sugar and caffeine, which was probably part of the reason why his hands shook. Dan wasn’t into being healthy. He liked to live on the edge. While he ate, Dan was studying Vanessa Abrams’s script for her short film, the film he was supposed to star in. He kept reading the same line, over and over, like a mantra: Life is fragile and absurd. “Tell me you don’t care about Serena van der Woodsen being back,” Jenny challenged Dan. She put a piece of grapefruit in her mouth and sucked on it. Then she stuck her fingers in her mouth, pulled out the white pulpy skin stuff, and put it on her plate. “You should see her,” she went on. “She looks so completely cool. It’s like she has this whole new look. I don’t mean her clothes; it’s her face. She looks older, but it’s not like wrinkles or anything. It’s like she’s Kate Moss or some model who’s like, been everywhere and seen everything and come out on the other side. She looks like she’s totally, like, experienced.” Jenny waited for her brother to respond, but he was just staring into his coffee cup. Life is fragile and absurd.
