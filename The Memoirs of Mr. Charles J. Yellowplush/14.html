<br> 
<br> My tail is droring rabidly to a close; my suvvice with Mr. Deuceace didn’t continyou very long after the last chapter, in which I described my admiral strattyjam, and my singlar self-devocean. There’s very few servnts, I can tell you, who’d have thought of such a contrivance, and very few moar would have eggsycuted it when thought of.
<br> 
<br> But, after all, beyond the trifling advantich to myself in selling master’s roab de sham, which you, gentle reader, may remember I woar, and in dixcovering a fipun note in one of the pockets — beyond this, I say, there was to poar master very little advantich in what had been done. It’s true he had escaped. Very good. But Frans is not like Great Brittin; a man in a livry coat, with 1 arm, is pretty easily known, and caught, too, as I can tell you.
<br> 
<br> Such was the case with master. He coodn leave Paris, moarover, if he would. What was to become, in that case, of his bride — his unchbacked hairis? He knew that young lady’s temprimong (as the Parishers say) too well to let her long out of his site. She had nine thousand a yer. She’d been in love a duzn times befor, and mite be agin. The Honrabble Algernon Deuceace was a little too wide awake to trust much to the constnsy of so very inflammable a young creacher. Heavn bless us, it was a marycle she wasn’t earlier married! I do bleave (from suttn seans that past betwigst us) that she’d have married me, if she hadn’t been sejuiced by the supearor rank and indianuity of the genlmn in whose survace I was.
<br> 
<br> Well, to use a commin igspreshn, the beaks were after him. How was he to manitch? He coodn get away from his debts, and he wooden quit the fare objict of his affeckshns. He was ableejd, then, as the French say, to lie perdew — going out at night, like a howl out of a hivy-bush, and returning in the daytime to his roast. For its a maxum in France (and I wood it were followed in Ingland), that after dark no man is lible for his detts; and in any of the royal gardens — the Twillaries, the Pally Roil, or the Lucksimbug, for example — a man may wander from sunrise to evening, and hear nothing of the ojus dunns: they an’t admitted into these places of public enjyment and rondyvoo any more than dogs; the centuries at the garden-gates having orders to shuit all such.
<br> 
<br> Master, then, was in this uncomfrable situation — neither liking to go nor to stay! peeping out at nights to have an interview with his miss; ableagd to shuffle off her repeated questions as to the reason of all this disgeise, and to talk of his two thowsnd a year jest as if he had it and didn’t owe a shilling in the world.
<br> 
<br> Of course, now, he began to grow mighty eager for the marritch.
<br> 
<br> He roat as many noats as she had done befor; swoar against delay and cerymony; talked of the pleasures of Hyming, the ardship that the ardor of two arts should be allowed to igspire, the folly of waiting for the consent of Lady Griffin. She was but a step-mother, and an unkind one. Miss was (he said) a major, might marry whom she liked; and suttnly had paid Lady G. quite as much attention as she ought, by paying her the compliment to ask her at all.
<br> 
<br> And so they went on. The curious thing was, that when master was pressed about his cause for not coming out till night-time, he was misterus; and Miss Griffin, when asked why she wooden marry, igsprest, or rather, DIDN’T igspress, a simlar secrasy. Wasn’t it hard? the cup seemed to be at the lip of both of ’em, and yet somehow, they could not manitch to take a drink.
<br> 
<br> But one morning, in reply to a most desprat epistol wrote by my master over night, Deuceace, delighted, gits an answer from his soal’s beluffd, which ran thus:—
<br> 
<br> MISS GRIFFIN TO THE HON. A. P. DEUCEACE.
<br> 
<br> “DEAREST — You say you would share a cottage with me; there is no need, luckily, for that! You plead the sad sinking of your spirits at our delayed union. Beloved, do you think MY heart rejoices at our separation? You bid me disregard the refusal of Lady Griffin, and tell me that I owe her no further duty.
<br> 
<br> “Adored Algernon! I can refuse you no more. I was willing not to lose a single chance of reconciliation with this unnatural step-mother. Respect for the memory of my sainted father bid me do all in my power to gain her consent to my union with you: nay, shall I own it? prudence dictated the measure; for to whom should she leave the share of money accorded to her by my father’s will but to my father’s child.
<br> 
<br> “But there are bounds beyond which no forbearance can go; and, thank heaven, we have no need of looking to Lady Griffin for sordid wealth: we have a competency without her. Is it not so, dearest Algernon?
<br> 
<br> “Be it as you wish, then, dearest, bravest, and best. Your poor Matilda has yielded to you her heart long ago; she has no longer need to keep back her name. Name the hour, and I will delay no more; but seek for refuge in your arms from the contumely and insult which meet me ever here.
<br> 
<br> “MATILDA.
<br> 
<br> “P.S. Oh, Algernon! if you did but know what a noble part your dear father has acted throughout, in doing his best endeavors to further our plans, and to soften Lady Griffin! It is not his fault that she is inexorable as she is. I send you a note sent by her to Lord Crabs; we will laugh at it soon, n’est-ce pas?
<br> II.
<br> 
<br> “MY LORD — In reply to your demand for Miss Griffin’s hand, in favor of your son, Mr. Algernon Deuceace, I can only repeat what I before have been under the necessity of stating to you — that I do not believe a union with a person of Mr. Deuceace’s character would conduce to my stepdaughter’s happiness, and therefore REFUSE MY CONSENT. I will beg you to communicate the contents of this note to Mr. Deuceace; and implore you no more to touch upon a subject which you must be aware is deeply painful to me.
<br> 
<br> “I remain your lordship’s most humble servant,
<br> 
<br> “L. E. GRIFFIN.
<br> 
<br> “THE RIGHT HON. THE EARL OF CRABS.”
<br> 
<br> “Hang her ladyship!” says my master, “what care I for it?” As for the old lord who’d been so afishous in his kindness and advice, master recknsiled that pretty well, with thinking that his lordship knew he was going to marry ten thousand a year, and igspected to get some share of it; for he roat back the following letter to his father, as well as a flaming one to Miss:
<br> 
<br> “Thank you, my dear father, for your kindness in that awkward business. You know how painfully I am situated just now, and can pretty well guess BOTH THE CAUSES of my disquiet. A marriage with my beloved Matilda will make me the happiest of men. The dear girl consents, and laughs at the foolish pretensions of her mother-inlaw. To tell you the truth, I wonder she yielded to them so long. Carry your kindness a step further, and find for us a parson, a license, and make us two into one. We are both major, you know; so that the ceremony of a guardian’s consent is unnecessary.
<br> 
<br> “Your affectionate
<br> 
<br> “ALGERNON DEUCEACE.
<br> 
<br> “How I regret that difference between us some time back! Matters are changed now, and shall be more still AFTER THE MARRIAGE.”
<br> 
<br> I knew what my master meant — that he would give the old lord the money after he was married; and as it was probble that miss would see the letter he roat, he made it such as not to let her see two clearly into his present uncomfrable situation.
<br> 
<br> I took this letter along with the tender one for Miss, reading both of ’em, in course, by the way. Miss, on getting hers, gave an inegspressable look with the white of her i’s, kist the letter, and prest it to her busm. Lord Crabs read his quite calm, and then they fell a-talking together; and told me to wait awhile, and I should git an anser.
<br> 
<br> After a deal of counseltation, my lord brought out a card, and there was simply written on it,
<br> 
<br> To-morrow, at the Ambassador’s, at Twelve.
<br> 
<br> “Carry that back to your master, Chawls,” says he, “and bid him not to fail.”
<br> 
<br> You may be sure I stept back to him pretty quick, and gave him the card and the messinge. Master looked sattasfied with both; but suttnly not over happy; no man is the day before his marridge; much more his marridge with a hump-back, Harriss though she be.
<br> 
<br> Well, as he was a-going to depart this bachelor life, he did what every man in such suckmstances ought to do; he made his will — that is, he made a dispasition of his property, and wrote letters to his creditors telling them of his lucky chance; and that after his marridge he would sutnly pay them every stiver. BEFORE, they must know his povvaty well enough to be sure that paymint was out of the question.
<br> 
<br> To do him justas, he seam’d to be inclined to do the thing that was right, now that it didn’t put him to any inkinvenients to do so.
<br> 
<br> “Chawls,” says he, handing me over a tenpun-note, “here’s your wagis, and thank you for getting me out of the scrape with the bailiffs: when you are married, you shall be my valet out of liv’ry, and I’ll treble your salary.”
<br> 
<br> His vallit! praps his butler! Yes, thought I, here’s a chance — a vallit to ten thousand a year. Nothing to do but to shave him, and read his notes, and let my whiskers grow; to dress in spick and span black, and a clean shut per day; muffings every night in the housekeeper’s room; the pick of the gals in the servants’ hall; a chap to clean my boots for me, and my master’s opera bone reglar once a week. I knew what a vallit was as well as any genlmn in service; and this I can tell you, he’s genrally a hapier, idler, handsomer, mor genlmnly man than his master. He has more money to spend, for genlmn WILL leave their silver in their waistcoat pockets; more suxess among the gals; as good dinners, and as good wine — that is, if he’s friends with the butler: and friends in corse they will be if they know which way their interest lies.
<br> 
<br> But these are only cassels in the air, what the French call shutter d’Espang. It wasn’t roat in the book of fate that I was to be Mr. Deuceace’s vallit.
<br> 
<br> Days will pass at last — even days befor a wedding, (the longist and unpleasantist day in the whole of a man’s life, I can tell you, excep, may be, the day before his hanging); and at length Aroarer dawned on the suspicious morning which was to unite in the bonds of Hyming the Honrable Algernon Percy Deuceace, Exquire, and Miss Matilda Griffin. My master’s wardrobe wasn’t so rich as it had been; for he’d left the whole of his nicknax and trumpry of dressing-cases and rob dy shams, his bewtifle museum of varnished boots, his curous colleckshn of Stulz and Staub coats, when he had been ableaged to quit so suddnly our pore dear lodginx at the Hotel Mirabew; and being incog at a friend’s house, ad contentid himself with ordring a coople of shoots of cloves from a common tailor, with a suffishnt quantaty of linning.
<br> 
<br> Well, he put on the best of his coats — a blue; and I thought it my duty to ask him whether he’d want his frock again: he was good natured and said, “Take it and be hanged to you.” Half-past eleven o’clock came, and I was sent to look out at the door, if there were any suspicious charicters (a precious good nose I have to find a bailiff out, I can tell you, and an i which will almost see one round a corner); and presenly a very modest green glass coach droave up, and in master stept. I didn’t in corse, appear on the box; because, being known, my appearints might have compromised master. But I took a short cut, and walked as quick as posbil down to the Rue de Foburg St. Honore, where his exlnsy the English ambasdor lives, and where marridges are always performed betwigst English folk at Paris.
<br> 
<br> . . . . . .
<br> 
<br> There is, almost nex door to the ambasdor’s hotel, another hotel, of that lo kind which the French call cabbyrays, or wine-houses; and jest as master’s green glass-coach pulled up, another coach drove off, out of which came two ladies, whom I knew pretty well — suffiz, that one had a humpback, and the ingenious reader will know why SHE came there; the other was poor Miss Kicksey, who came to see her turned off.
<br> 
<br> Well, master’s glass-coach droav up, jest as I got within a few yards of the door; our carridge, I say, droav up, and stopt. Down gits coachmin to open the door, and comes I to give Mr. Deuceace an arm, when out of the cabaray shoot four fellows, and draw up betwigst the coach and embassy-doar; two other chaps go to the other doar of the carridge, and, opening it, one says —“Rendez-vous, M. Deuceace! Je vous arrete au nom de la loi!” (which means, “Get out of that, Mr. D.; you are nabbed and no mistake.”) Master turned gashly pail, and sprung to the other side of the coach, as if a serpint had stung him. He flung open the door, and was for making off that way; but he saw the four chaps standing betwigst libbarty and him. He slams down the front window, and screams out, “Fouettez, cocher!” (which means, “Go it, coachmm!” in a despert loud voice; but coachmin wooden go it, and besides was off his box.
<br> 
<br> The long and short of the matter was, that jest as I came up to the door two of the bums jumped into the carridge. I saw all; I knew my duty, and so very mornfly I got up behind.
<br> 
<br> “Tiens,” says one of the chaps in the street; “c’est ce drole qui nous a floure l’autre jour.” I knew ’em, but was too melumcolly to smile.
<br> 
<br> “Ou irons-nous donc?” says coachmin to the genlmn who had got inside.
<br> 
<br> A deep woice from the intearor shouted out, in reply to the coachmin, “A SAINTE PELAGIE!”
<br> 
<br> . . . . . .
<br> 
<br> And now, praps, I ot to dixcribe to you the humors of the prizn of Sainte Pelagie, which is the French for Fleat, or Queen’s Bentch: but on this subject I’m rather shy of writing, partly because the admiral Boz has, in the history of Mr. Pickwick, made such a dixcripshun of a prizn, that mine wooden read very amyousingly afterwids; and, also, because, to tell you the truth, I didn’t stay long in it, being not in a humer to waist my igsistance by passing away the ears of my youth in such a dull place.
<br> 
<br> My fust errint now was, as you may phansy, to carry a noat from master to his destined bride. The poar thing was sadly taken aback, as I can tell you, when she found, after remaining two hours at the Embassy, that her husband didn’t make his appearance. And so, after staying on and on, and yet seeing no husband, she was forsed at last to trudge dishconslit home, where I was already waiting for her with a letter from my master.
<br> 
<br> There was no use now denying the fact of his arrest, and so he confest it at onst: but he made a cock-and-bull story of treachery of a friend, infimous fodgery, and heaven knows what. However, it didn’t matter much; if he had told her that he had been betrayed by the man in the moon, she would have bleavd him.
<br> 
<br> Lady Griffin never used to appear now at any of my visits. She kep one drawing-room, and Miss dined and lived alone in another; they quarld so much that praps it was best they should live apart; only my Lord Crabs used to see both, comforting each with that winning and innsnt way he had. He came in as Miss, in tears, was lisning to my account of master’s seazure, and hoping that the prisn wasn’t a horrid place, with a nasty horrid dunjeon, and a dreadfle jailer, and nasty horrid bread and water. Law bless us! she had borrod her ideers from the novvles she had been reading!
<br> 
<br> “O my lord, my lord,” says she, “have you heard this fatal story?”
<br> 
<br> “Dearest Matilda, what? For heaven’s sake, you alarm me! What — yes — no — is it — no, it can’t be! Speak!” says my lord, seizing me by the choler of my coat. “What has happened to my boy?”
<br> 
<br> “Please you, my lord,” says I, “he’s at this moment in prisn, no wuss — having been incarserated about two hours ago.”
<br> 
<br> “In prison! Algernon in prison! ’tis impossible! Imprisoned, for what sum? Mention it, and I will pay to the utmost farthing in my power.”
<br> 
<br> “I’m sure your lordship is very kind,” says I (recklecting the sean betwixgst him and master, whom he wanted to diddil out of a thowsand lb.); “and you’ll he happy to hear he’s only in for a trifle. Five thousand pound is, I think, pretty near the mark.”
<br> 
<br> “Five thousand pounds! — confusion!” says my lord, clasping his hands, and looking up to heaven, “and I have not five hundred! Dearest Matilda, how shall we help him?”
<br> 
<br> “Alas, my lord, I have but three guineas, and you know how Lady Griffin has the —”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, my sweet child, I know what you would say; but be of good cheer — Algernon, you know, has ample funds of his own.”
<br> 
<br> Thinking my lord meant Dawkins’s five thousand, of which, to be sure, a good lump was left, I held my tung; but I cooden help wondering at Lord Crabs’s igstream compashn for his son, and Miss, with her 10,000L. a year, having only 3 guineas is her pockit.
<br> 
<br> I took home (bless us, what a home!) a long and very inflamble letter from Miss, in which she dixscribed her own sorror at the disappointment; swoar she lov’d him only the moar for his misfortns; made light of them; as a pusson for a paltry sum of five thousand pound ought never to be cast down, ‘specially as he had a certain independence in view; and vowed that nothing, nothing, should ever injuice her to part from him, etsettler, etsettler.
<br> 
<br> I told master of the conversation which had past betwigst me and my lord, and of his handsome offers, and his horrow at hearing of his son’s being taken; and likewise mentioned how strange it was that Miss should only have 3 guineas, and with such a fortn: bless us, I should have thot that she would always have carried a hundred thowsnd lb. in her pockit!
<br> 
<br> At this master only said Pshaw! But the rest of the story about his father seemed to dixquiet him a good deal, and he made me repeat it over agin.
<br> 
<br> He walked up and down the room agytated, and it seam’d as if a new lite was breaking in upon him.
<br> 
<br> “Chawls,” says he, “did you observe — did Miss — did my father seem PARTICULARLY INTIMATE with Miss Griffin?”
<br> 
<br> “How do you mean, sir?” says I.
<br> 
<br> “Did Lord Crabs appear very fond of Miss Griffin?”
<br> 
<br> “He was suttnly very kind to her.”
<br> 
<br> “Come, sir, speak at once: did Miss Griffin seem very fond of his lordship?”
<br> 
<br> “Why, to tell the truth, sir, I must say she seemed VERY fond of him.”
<br> 
<br> “What did he call her?”
<br> 
<br> “He called her his dearest gal.”
<br> 
<br> “Did he take her hand?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, and he —”
<br> 
<br> “And he what?”
<br> 
<br> “He kist her, and told her not to be so wery down-hearted about the misfortn which had hapnd to you.”
<br> 
<br> “I have it now!” says he, clinching his fist, and growing gashly pail —“I have it now — the infernal old hoary scoundrel! the wicked, unnatural wretch! He would take her from me!” And he poured out a volley of oaves which are impossbill to be repeatid here.
<br> 
<br> I thot as much long ago: and when my lord kem with his vizits so pretious affeckshnt at my Lady Griffinses, I expected some such game was in the wind. Indeed, I’d heard a somethink of it from the Griffinses servnts, that my lord was mighty tender with the ladies.
<br> 
<br> One thing, however, was evident to a man of his intleckshal capassaties; he must either marry the gal at onst, or he stood very small chance of having her. He must get out of limbo immediantly, or his respectid father might be stepping into his vaykint shoes. Oh! he saw it all now — the fust attempt at arest, the marridge fixt at 12 o’clock, and the bayliffs fixt to come and intarup the marridge! — the jewel, praps, betwigst him and De l’Orge: but no, it was the WOMAN who did that — a MAN don’t deal such fowl blows, igspecially a father to his son: a woman may, poar thing! — she’s no other means of reventch, and is used to fight with underhand wepns all her life through.
<br> 
<br> Well, whatever the pint might be, this Deuceace saw pretty clear that he’d been beat by his father at his own game — a trapp set for him onst, which had been defitted by my presnts of mind — another trap set afterwids, in which my lord had been suxesfle. Now, my lord, roag as he was, was much too good-natured to do an unkind ackshn, mearly for the sake of doing it. He’d got to that pich that he didn’t mind injaries — they were all fair play to him — he gave ’em, and reseav’d them, without a thought of mallis. If he wanted to injer his son, it was to benefick himself. And how was this to he done? By getting the hairiss to himself, to be sure. The Honrabble Mr. D. didn’t say so; but I knew his feelinx well enough — he regretted that he had not given the old genlmn the money he askt for.
<br> 
<br> Poar fello! he thought he had hit it; but he was wide of the mark after all.
<br> 
<br> Well, but what was to be done? It was clear that he must marry the gal at any rate — cootky coot, as the French say: that is, marry her, and hang the igspence.
<br> 
<br> To do so he must first git out of prisn — to get out of prisn he must pay his debts — and to pay his debts, he must give every shilling he was worth. Never mind: four thousand pound is a small stake to a reglar gambler, igspecially when he must play it, or rot for life in prisn; and when, if he plays it well, it will give him ten thousand a year.
<br> 
<br> So, seeing there was no help for it, he maid up his mind, and accordingly wrote the follying letter to Miss Griffin:—
<br> 
<br> “MY ADORED MATILDA — Your letter has indeed been a comfort to a poor fellow, who had hoped that this night would have been the most blessed in his life, and now finds himself condemned to spend it within a prison wall! You know the accursed conspiracy which has brought these liabilities upon me, and the foolish friendship which has cost me so much. But what matters! We have, as you say, enough, even though I must pay this shameful demand upon me; and five thousand pounds are as nothing, compared to the happiness which I lose in being separated a night from thee! Courage, however! If I make a sacrifice it is for you; and I were heartless indeed if I allowed my own losses to balance for a moment against your happiness.
<br> 
<br> “Is it not so, beloved one? IS not your happiness bound up with mine, in a union with me? I am proud to think so — proud, too, to offer such a humble proof as this of the depth and purity of my affection.
<br> 
<br> “Tell me that you will still be mine; tell me that you will be mine tomorrow; and tomorrow these vile chains shall be removed, and I will be free once more — or if bound, only bound to you! My adorable Matilda! my betrothed bride! Write to me ere the evening closes, for I shall never be able to shut my eyes in slumber upon my prison couch, until they have been first blessed by the sight of a few words from thee! Write to me, love! write to me! I languish for the reply which is to make or mar me for ever. Your affectionate
<br> 
<br> “A. P. D.”
<br> 
<br> Having polisht off this epistol, master intrustid it to me to carry, and bade me at the same time to try and give it into Miss Griffin’s hand alone. I ran with it to Lady Griffinses. I found Miss, as I desired, in a sollatary condition; and I presented her with master’s pafewmed Billy.
<br> 
<br> She read it, and the number of size to which she gave vint, and the tears which she shed, beggar digscription. She wep and sighed until I thought she would bust. She even claspt my hand in her’s, and said, “O Charles! is he very, very miserable?”
<br> 
<br> “He is, ma’am,” says I; “very miserable indeed — nobody, upon my honor, could be miserablerer.”
<br> 
<br> On hearing this pethetic remark, her mind was made up at onst: and sitting down to her eskrewtaw, she immediantly ableaged master with an answer. Here it is in black and white:
<br> 
<br> “My prisoned bird shall pine no more, but fly home to its nest in these arms! Adored Algernon, I will meet thee tomorrow, at the same place, at the same hour. Then, then, it will be impossible for aught but death to divide us.
<br> 
<br> “M. G.”
<br> 
<br> This kind of flumry style comes, you see, of reading novvles, and cultivating littery purshuits in a small way. How much better is it to be puffickly ignorant of the hart of writing, and to trust to the writing of the heart. This is MY style: artyfiz I despise, and trust compleatly to natur: but revnong a no mootong, as our continential friends remark: to that nice white sheep, Algernon Percy Deuceace, Exquire; that wenrabble old ram, my Lord Crabs his father; and that tender and dellygit young lamb, Miss Matilda Griffin.
<br> 
<br> She had just foalded up into its proper triangular shape the noat transcribed abuff, and I was just on the point of saying, according to my master’s orders, “Miss, if you please, the Honrabble Mr. Deuceace would be very much ableaged to you to keep the seminary which is to take place tomorrow a profound se — ” when my master’s father entered, and I fell back to the door. Miss, without a word, rusht into his arms, burst into teers agin, as was her reglar way (it must be confest she was of a very mist constitution), and showing to him his son’s note, cried, “Look, my dear lord, how nobly your Algernon, OUR Algernon, writes to me. Who can doubt, after this, of the purity of his matchless affection?”
<br> 
<br> My lord took the letter, read it, seamed a good deal amyoused, and returning it to its owner, said, very much to my surprise, “My dear Miss Griffin, he certainly does seem in earnest; and if you choose to make this match without the consent of your mother-inlaw, you know the consequence, and are of course your own mistress.”
<br> 
<br> “Consequences! — for shame, my lord! A little money, more or less, what matters it to two hearts like ours?”
<br> 
<br> “Hearts are very pretty things, my sweet young lady, but Three-per-Cents are better.”
<br> 
<br> “Nay, have we not an ample income of our own, without the aid of Lady Griffin?”
<br> 
<br> My lord shrugged his shoulders. “Be it so, my love,” says he. “I’m sure I can have no other reason to prevent a union which is founded upon such disinterested affection.”
<br> 
<br> And here the conversation dropt. Miss retired, clasping her hands, and making play with the whites of her i’s. My lord began trotting up and down the room, with his fat hands stuck in his britchis pockits, his countnince lighted up with igstream joy, and singing, to my inordnit igstonishment:
<br> 
<br> “See the conquering hero comes!
<br> Tiddy diddy doll — tiddy doll, doll, doll.”
<br> 
<br> He began singing this song, and tearing up and down the room like mad. I stood amazd — a new light broke in upon me. He wasn’t going, then, to make love to Miss Griffin! Master might marry her! Had she not got the for —?
<br> 
<br> I say, I was just standing stock still, my eyes fixt, my hands puppindicklar, my mouf wide open and these igstrordinary thoughts passing in my mind, when my lord having got to the last “doll” of his song, just as I came to the sillible “for” of my ventriloquism, or inward speech — we had eatch jest reached the pint digscribed, when the meditations of both were sudnly stopt, by my lord, in the midst of his singin and trottin match, coming bolt up aginst poar me, sending me up aginst one end of the room, himself flying back to the other: and it was only after considrabble agitation that we were at length restored to anything like a liquilibrium.
<br> 
<br> “What, YOU here, you infernal rascal?” says my lord.
<br> 
<br> “Your lordship’s very kind to notus me,” says I; “I am here.” And I gave him a look.
<br> 
<br> He saw I knew the whole game.
<br> 
<br> And after whisling a bit, as was his habit when puzzled (I bleave he’d have only whisled if he had been told he was to be hanged in five minits), after whisling a bit, he stops sudnly, and coming up to me, says:
<br> 
<br> “Hearkye, Charles, this marriage must take place tomorrow.”
<br> 
<br> “Must it, sir?” says I; “now, for my part, I don’t think —”
<br> 
<br> “Stop, my good fellow; if it does not take place, what do you gain?”
<br> 
<br> This stagger’d me. If it didn’t take place, I only lost a situation, for master had but just enough money to pay his detts; and it wooden soot my book to serve him in prisn or starving.
<br> 
<br> “Well,” says my lord, “you see the force of my argument. Now, look here!” and he lugs out a crisp, fluttering, snowy HUNDRED-PUN NOTE! “If my son and Miss Griffin are married tomorrow, you shall have this; and I will, moreover, take you into my service, and give you double your present wages.”
<br> 
<br> Flesh and blood cooden bear it. “My lord,” says I, laying my hand upon my busm, “only give me security, and I’m yours for ever.”
<br> 
<br> The old noblemin grin’d, and pattid me on the shoulder. “Right, my lad,” says he, “right — you’re a nice promising youth. Here is the best security.” And he pulls out his pockit-book, returns the hundred-pun bill, and takes out one for fifty. “Here is half today; tomorrow you shall have the remainder.”
<br> 
<br> My fingers trembled a little as I took the pretty fluttering bit of paper, about five times as big as any sum of money I had ever had in my life. I cast my i upon the amount: it was a fifty sure enough — a bank poss-bill, made payable to Leonora Emilia Griffin, and indorsed by her. The cat was out of the bag. Now, gentle reader, I spose you begin to see the game.
<br> 
<br> “Recollect, from this day you are in my service.”
<br> 
<br> “My lord, you overpoar me with your faviors.”
<br> 
<br> “Go to the devil, sir,” says he: “do your duty, and hold your tongue.”
<br> 
<br> And thus I went from the service of the Honorabble Algernon Deuceace to that of his exlnsy the Right Honorabble Earl of Crabs.
<br> 
<br> . . . . . .
<br> 
<br> On going back to prisn, I found Deuceace locked up in that oajus place to which his igstravygansies had deservedly led him; and felt for him, I must say, a great deal of contemp. A raskle such as he — a swindler, who had robbed poar Dawkins of the means of igsistance; who had cheated his fellow-roag, Mr. Richard Blewitt, and who was making a musnary marridge with a disgusting creacher like Miss Griffin, didn merit any compashn on my purt; and I determined quite to keep secret the suckmstansies of my privit intervew with his exlnsy my presnt master.
<br> 
<br> I gev him Miss Griffinses trianglar, which he read with a satasfied air. Then, turning to me, says he: “You gave this to Miss Griffin alone?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, sir.”
<br> 
<br> “You gave her my message?”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, sir.”
<br> 
<br> “And you are quite sure Lord Crabs was not there when you gave either the message or the note?”
<br> 
<br> “Not there upon my honor,” says I.
<br> 
<br> “Hang your honor, sir! Brush my hat and coat, and go CALL A COACH— do you hear?”
<br> 
<br> . . . . . .
<br> 
<br> I did as I was ordered; and on coming back found master in what’s called, I think, the greffe of the prisn. The officer in waiting had out a great register, and was talking to master in the French tongue, in coarse; a number of poar prisners were looking eagerly on.
<br> 
<br> “Let us see, my lor,” says he; “the debt is 98,700 francs; there are capture expenses, interest so much; and the whole sum amounts to a hundred thousand francs, moins 13.”
<br> 
<br> Deuceace, in a very myjestic way, takes out of his pocketbook four thowsnd pun notes. “This is not French money, but I presume that you know it, M. Greffier,” says he.
<br> 
<br> The greffier turned round to old Solomon, a money-changer, who had one or two clients in the prisn, and hapnd luckily to be there. “Les billets sont bons,” says he. “Je les prendrai pour cent mille douze cent francs, et j’espere, my lor, de vous revoir.”
<br> 
<br> “Good,” says the greffier; “I know them to be good, and I will give my lor the difference, and make out his release.”
<br> 
<br> Which was done. The poar debtors gave a feeble cheer, as the great dubble iron gates swung open and clang to again, and Deuceace stept out and me after him, to breathe the fresh hair.
<br> 
<br> He had been in the place but six hours, and was now free again — free, and to be married to ten thousand a year nex day. But, for all that, he lookt very faint and pale. He HAD put down his great stake; and when he came out of Sainte Pelagie, he had but fifty pounds left in the world!
<br> 
<br> Never mind — when onst the money’s down, make your mind easy; and so Deuceace did. He drove back to the Hotel Mirabew, where he ordered apartmince infinately more splendid than befor; and I pretty soon told Toinette, and the rest of the suvvants, how nobly he behayved, and how he valyoud four thousnd pound no more than ditch water. And such was the consquincies of my praises, and the poplarity I got for us boath, that the delighted landlady immediantly charged him dubble what she would have done, if it hadn been for my stoaries.
<br> 
<br> He ordered splendid apartmince, then, for the nex week; a carridge-and-four for Fontainebleau tomorrow at 12 precisely; and having settled all these things, went quietly to the “Roshy de Cancale,” where he dined: as well he might, for it was now eight o’clock. I didn’t spare the shompang neither that night, I can tell you; for when I carried the note he gave me for Miss Griffin in the evening, informing her of his freedom, that young lady remarked my hagitated manner of walking and speaking, and said, “Honest Charles! he is flusht with the events of the day. Here, Charles, is a napoleon; take it and drink to your mistress.”
<br> 
<br> I pockitid it; but, I must say, I didn’t like the money — it went against my stomick to take it.
