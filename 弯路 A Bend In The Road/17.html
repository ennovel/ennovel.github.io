To Sarah, it looked as if her mother planned to feed a few dozen people for at least a week.</p> 
<p>“You will, Mom, in a few days. Like I said, he and Jonah will be coming by for dinner.”</p> 
<p>“But wouldn’t he be more comfortable if he came over before that? So we could have a chance to get to know each other?”</p> 
<p>“You’ll have plenty of time to get to know him, Mom. You know how Thanksgiving is.”</p> 
<p>“But with everyone else around, it’s just not going to be possible to visit the way I’d like.”</p> 
<p>“I’m sure he’ll understand.”</p> 
<p>“And didn’t you say he has to leave early?”</p> 
<p>“He has to go to work about four o’clock.”</p> 
<p>“On a holiday?”</p> 
<p>“He works Thanksgiving Day so he can have Christmas off. He’s a sheriff, you know. It’s not like they can let everyone take the day off.” “So who’s going to watch Jonah?”</p> 
<p>“I will. I’ll probably bring him back to Miles’s house. You know Dad—he’ll be sound asleep by six o’clock, and I’ll probably bring him home then.” “So early?”</p> 
<p>“Don’t worry. We’ll still be there all afternoon.”</p> 
<p>“You’re right,” Maureen said. “It’s just that I’m a little frazzled from all this.”</p> 
<p>“Don’t be worried, Mom. Nothing’s going to go wrong.”</p> 
<p>? ? ?</p> 
<p>“Will there be other kids there?” Jonah asked.</p> 
<p>“I don’t know,” Miles said. “There might be.”</p> 
<p>“Boys or girls?”</p> 
<p>“I don’t know.”</p> 
<p>“Well . . . how old are they?”</p> 
<p>Miles shook his head. “Like I said, I don’t know. I’m not even sure there will be other kids there, to tell you the truth. I forgot to ask.” Jonah furrowed his brow. “But if I’m the only kid, what will I do?”</p> 
<p>“Watch the football game with me?”</p> 
<p>“That’s boring.”</p> 
<p>Miles reached for his son, sliding him along the front seat until he was close.&nbsp; “Well, we’re not going to be there all day, anyway, since I have to work. But we do have to visit at least for a little while. I mean, they were nice enough to invite us over, and it wouldn’t be polite to leave right after we eat. But maybe we can go for a walk or something.”</p> 
<p>“With Miss Andrews?”</p> 
<p>“If you’d like her to come.”</p> 
<p>“Okay.” He paused, his head turned toward the window. They were rolling past a grove of loblolly pines. “Dad . . . do you think we’re having turkey?” “I’m pretty sure we are. Why?”</p> 
<p>“Will it taste funny? Like it did last year?”</p> 
<p>“Are you saying you didn’t like my cooking?”</p> 
<p>“It tasted funny.”</p> 
<p>“It did not.”</p> 
<p>“To me it did.”</p> 
<p>“Maybe they’re better cooks than I am.”</p> 
<p>“I hope so.”</p> 
<p>“Are you picking on me?”</p> 
<p>Jonah grinned. “Kind of. But it did taste funny, you know.”</p> 
<p>? ? ?</p> 
<p>Miles and Jonah pulled up in front of a two-story brick home and parked near the mailbox. The lawn had all the markings of someone who enjoyed gardening. Pansies had been planted along the walkway, pine straw had been spread around the bases of the trees, and the only leaves in evidence were those that had fallen the night before. Sarah brushed back the curtain and waved from inside the house. A moment later, she opened the front door.</p> 
<p>“Wow, you look impressive,” she said.</p> 
<p>Miles’s hand went absently to his tie. “Thanks.”</p> 
<p>“I was talking to Jonah,” she said with a wink, and Jonah glanced at his father with a victorious expression. He was wearing navy slacks and a white shirt and looked clean enough to have come straight from church. He gave Sarah a quick hug.</p> 
<p>From behind her back, Sarah brought out a set of Matchbox cars, which she handed to Jonah.</p> 
<p>“What’s this for?” he asked.</p> 
<p>“I just wanted you to have something to play with while you’re here,” she said.</p> 
<p>“Do you like them?”</p> 
<p>He stared at the box. “This is great! Dad . . . look.” He held the box in the air.</p> 
<p>“I see that. Did you say thanks?”</p> 
<p>“Thank you, Miss Andrews.”</p> 
<p>“You’re welcome.”</p> 
<p>As soon as Miles approached, Sarah stood again and greeted him with a kiss. “I was just kidding, you know. You look nice, too. I’m not used to seeing you wearing a jacket and tie in the middle of the afternoon.” She fingered his lapel slightly. “I could get used to this.”</p> 
<p>“Thank you, Miss Andrews,” he said, mimicking his son. “You look pretty nice yourself.”</p> 
<p>And she did. If anything, the longer he knew her, the prettier she seemed to get, no matter what she wore.</p> 
<p>“You ready to come inside?” she asked.</p> 
<p>“Whenever you are,” Miles answered.</p> 
<p>“How about you, Jonah?”</p> 
<p>“Are there any other kids here?”</p> 
<p>“No. I’m sorry. Just a bunch of grown-ups. But they’re really nice, and they’re looking forward to meeting you.”</p> 
<p>He nodded and his eyes traveled to the box again. “Can I open this now?”</p> 
<p>“If you’d like to. It’s yours, so you can open it whenever you want.”</p> 
<p>“So I can play with them outside, too?”</p> 
<p>“Sure,” Sarah said. “That’s why I got them—”</p> 
<p>“But first,” Miles added, cutting into the conversation, “you’ve got to come inside and meet everyone. And if you do head back out to play, I don’t want you getting dirty before dinner.”</p> 
<p>“Okay,” Jonah agreed instantly, and from the look on his face, it seemed he believed that he’d stay clean. Miles, however, was under no illusions. A seven-year-old boy, playing on the ground outside? Not a chance, but hopefully he wouldn’t get too grubby.</p> 
<p>“All right, then,” Sarah said. “Let’s head on in. One word of caution, though .</p> 
<p>. .”</p> 
<p>“Is it about your mother?”</p> 
<p>Sarah smiled. “How did you know?”</p> 
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll be on my best behavior, and Jonah will, too, right?”</p> 
<p>Jonah nodded without looking up.</p> 
<p>Sarah took Miles’s hand and leaned close to his ear. “It’s not you two that I was worried about.”</p> 
<p>? ? ?</p> 
<p>“So there you are!” Maureen cried as she emerged from the kitchen.&nbsp; Sarah nudged Miles. Following her eyes, Miles was surprised to see that Maureen looked nothing like her daughter. Where Sarah was blond, Maureen’s hair was graying in a way that looked as if it had been black at one time; where Sarah was tall and thin, her mother had a more matronly appearance. And while Sarah seemed to glide when she walked, Maureen seemed almost to bounce as she approached them. She was wearing a white apron over her blue dress and held her hands out as she approached, as if greeting long-lost friends. “I’ve heard so much about you both!”</p> 
<p>Maureen enveloped Miles in a hug and did the same thing to Jonah, even before Sarah made the formal introductions. “I’m so glad you could come! We’ve got a full house, as you can see, but you two are the guests of honor.” She seemed practically giddy.</p> 
<p>“What’s that?” Jonah asked.</p> 
<p>“It means that everyone’s been waiting for you.”</p> 
<p>“It does?”</p> 
<p>“Yessiree.”</p> 
<p>“They don’t even know me,” Jonah said innocently, as he glanced around the room, feeling the eyes of strangers on him. Miles put a comforting hand on his shoulder.</p> 
<p>“It’s nice to meet you, Maureen. And thanks for having us over.” “Oh, it was my pleasure.” She giggled. “We’re just glad you could come. And I know that Sarah was glad, too.”</p> 
<p>“Mom . . .”</p> 
<p>“Well, you were. No reason to deny it.” She turned her attention to Miles and Jonah, talking and giggling for the next few minutes. When she’d finally finished, she began to introduce them to the grandparents, as well as the rest of Sarah’s relatives, about a dozen people in all. Miles shook hands, Jonah followed his lead, and Sarah winced at the way Maureen kept introducing Miles.&nbsp; “This is Sarah’s friend,” she’d say, but it was her tone—a mixture of pride and motherly approval—that left no doubt as to what she really meant. When they’d finished, Maureen seemed almost exhausted by the performance. She turned her attention back to Miles. “Now, what can I get you to drink?” “How about a beer?”</p> 
<p>“One beer coming up. And how about for you, Jonah? We’ve got root beer or Seven-Up.”</p> 
<p>“Root beer.”</p> 
<p>“Let me go with you, Mom,” Sarah said, taking hold of her mother’s arm. “I think I need a drink, too.”</p> 
<p>On their way to the kitchen, her mother was beaming. “Oh, Sarah . . . I’m so happy for you.”</p> 
<p>“Thanks.”</p> 
<p>“He seems wonderful. Such a nice smile. He looks like someone you can trust.”</p> 
<p>“I know.”</p> 
<p>“And that boy of his is darling.”</p> 
<p>“Yes, Mother. . . .”</p> 
<p>? ? ?</p> 
<p>“Where’s Daddy?” Sarah asked a few minutes later. Her mother had finally calmed down enough to turn her attention back to her dinner preparations.&nbsp; “I sent him and Brian out to the grocery store a few minutes ago,” Maureen answered. “We needed some more rolls and a bottle of wine. I wasn’t sure we had enough.”</p> 
<p>Sarah opened the oven and checked the turkey; the smell wafted through the kitchen.</p> 
<p>“So Brian’s finally up?”</p> 
<p>“He was tired. He didn’t get here until after midnight. He had an exam on Wednesday afternoon, so he couldn’t get away earlier.” At that moment, the back door opened and Larry and Brian came in carrying a couple of bags, which they set on the counter. Brian, looking leaner and older somehow than when he’d left last August, saw Sarah and they hugged.&nbsp; “So how’s school going? I haven’t talked to you in what seems like forever.”</p> 
<p>“It’s going. You know how it is. How’s the job?”</p> 
<p>“It’s good. I like it.” She glanced over Brian’s shoulder. “Hi, Daddy.”</p> 
<p>“Hey, sweetheart,” Larry said, “it smells great in here.” As they put the groceries away, they chatted for a few minutes until Sarah finally told them there was someone she’d like them to meet.&nbsp; “Yeah, Mom mentioned that you were seeing someone.” Brian wiggled his eyebrows conspiratorially. “I’m glad. Is he a good guy?”</p> 
<p>“I think so.”</p> 
<p>“Is it serious?”</p> 
<p>Sarah couldn’t help but notice that her mother stopped peeling the potatoes as she waited for the answer.</p> 
<p>“I don’t know yet,” she said evasively. “Would you like to meet him?”</p> 
<p>Brian shrugged. “Yeah, okay.”</p> 
<p>She reached out and touched his arm. “Don’t worry, you’ll like him.” Brian nodded. “You coming, Daddy?”</p> 
<p>“In a minute. Your mother wants me to find some of the extra serving bowls.</p> 
<p>They’re in a box in the pantry somewhere.”</p> 
<p>Sarah and Brian left the kitchen and headed to the living room, though she didn’t see Miles or Jonah. Her grandmother said that Miles had gone outside for a minute, but when she stepped out the front door, she still didn’t see him.&nbsp; “He must be around back. . . .”</p> 
<p>As they turned the corner of the house, Sarah finally spotted them. Jonah had found a small mound of dirt and was pushing the Matchbox cars along imaginary roads.</p> 
<p>“So what’s this guy do? Is he a teacher?”</p> 
<p>“No, but that’s how I met him. His son is in my class. Actually, he’s a deputy sheriff. Hey, Miles!” she called out. “Jonah!” When they turned, Sarah nodded in her brother’s direction. “There’s someone I’d like you to meet.” When Jonah stood up from the dirt, Sarah saw that the knees of his pants were circled with brown. He and Miles met them halfway.</p> 
<p>“This is my brother, Brian. And Brian, this is Miles and his son, Jonah.”</p> 
<p>Miles held out his hand. “How are you doing? Miles Ryan. Nice to meet you.”</p> 
<p>Brian held his hand out stiffly. “Nice to meet you, too.”</p> 
<p>“I hear you’re in college.”</p> 
<p>Brian nodded. “Yes, sir.”</p> 
<p>Sarah laughed. “You don’t have to be so formal. He’s only a couple of years older than I am.” Brian smiled weakly but didn’t say anything, and Jonah looked up at him. Brian took a small step backward, as if uncertain how to address a young child.</p> 
<p>“Hi,” Jonah said.</p> 
<p>“Hi,” Brian answered.</p> 
<p>“You’re Miss Andrews’s brother?”</p> 
<p>Brian nodded.</p> 
<p>“She’s my teacher.”</p> 
<p>“I know. She told me.”</p> 
<p>“Oh . . .” Jonah looked suddenly bored and started fiddling with the cars in his hands. For a long moment, none of them said anything.</p> 
<p>? ? ?</p> 
<p>“I wasn’t hiding from your family,” Miles said a few minutes later. “Jonah asked if I’d come out here with him to see if I thought it would be okay to play here.&nbsp; I said it probably was—I hope that’s okay.”</p> 
<p>“That’s fine,” Sarah said. “As long as he’s having fun.” Larry had come around the corner as the four of them were talking and asked Brian if he could look in the garage for the serving dishes he’d been unable to find. Brian wandered off in that direction, then disappeared from view.</p> 
<p>Larry, too, was quiet, though in a more speculative way than Brian. He seemed to</p> 
<p>regard Miles with a studying eye, as if watching his expressions would reveal</p> 
<p>more than the words Miles was saying as they covered the basics about each</p> 
<p>other. That feeling quickly passed as they found common interests, like the</p> 
<p>upcoming football game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Miami Dolphins. Within</p> 
<p>a few minutes, they were talking easily. Larry finally made his way back to the house, leaving Sarah alone with Miles and Jonah. Jonah went back to the mound of dirt.</p> 
<p>“Your father’s quite a character. I had the strangest feeling that when we first met, he was trying to figure out whether we’d slept together.” Sarah laughed. “He probably was. I am his baby girl, you know.”</p> 
<p>“Yeah, I know. How long’s he been married to your mom?”</p> 
<p>“Almost thirty-five years.”</p> 
<p>“That’s a long time.”</p> 
<p>“Sometimes I think he should be sainted.”</p> 
<p>“Now, now . . . don’t be so hard on your mom. I liked her, too.” “I think the feeling was mutual. For a while there, I thought she was going to offer to adopt you.”</p> 
<p>“Like you said, she just wants you to be happy.”</p> 
<p>“Say that to her, and I don’t think she’ll ever let you leave. She needs someone to take care of, now that Brian’s off at college. Oh, listen—don’t take Brian’s shyness personally. He’s really reserved when it comes to meeting people. Once he gets to know you, he’ll come out of his shell.”</p> 
<p>Miles shook his head, dismissing her worries. “He was fine. Besides, he kind of reminds me of how I was at that age. Believe it or not, there are times when I don’t know what to say, either.”</p> 
<p>Sarah’s eyes went wide. “No . . . really? And here I thought you were the smoothest talker I’d ever met. Why, you practically swept me off my feet.” “Do you honestly believe that sarcasm is the right tone to take on a day like today? A day to be with family and offer thanks for all our blessings?” “Of course.”</p> 
<p>He put his arms around her. “Well, in my defense, then, whatever I did seemed to work, didn’t it?”</p> 
<p>She sighed. “I suppose.”</p> 
<p>“You suppose?”</p> 
<p>“What do you want? A medal?”</p> 
<p>“For starters. A trophy would be nice, too.”</p> 
<p>She smiled. “What do you think you’re holding right now?”</p> 
<p>? ? ?</p> 
<p>The rest of the afternoon passed uneventfully. After the meal was cleared away, some of the family went to watch the game, others went to the kitchen to help store the mountains of leftovers. The afternoon was unhurried, and after stuffing himself with two pieces of pie, even Jonah seemed to find the atmosphere soothing. Larry and Miles chatted about New Bern, Larry quizzing Miles about local history. Sarah wandered from the kitchen, where her mother repeated (and repeated) the fact that Miles seemed like a wonderful young man, back to the living room to make sure that Miles and Jonah didn’t feel as if she’d abandoned them. Brian, dutifully, spent most of his time in the kitchen, washing and drying the china that his mother had used for dinner.&nbsp; A half hour before Miles had to head home to get dressed for work, Miles, Sarah, and Jonah went for a walk, just as Miles had promised. They headed toward the end of the block and into the wooded area that fronted the development. Jonah grabbed Sarah’s hand and led her through the woods, laughing as he did so, and it was while watching them weave their way among the trees that it gradually dawned on Miles where all this might lead. While he knew he loved Sarah, he’d been touched that she had chosen to share her family with him. He liked the feeling of closeness, the holiday atmosphere, the casual way her relatives had seemed to respond to him, and he was certain that he didn’t want this to be an isolated invitation.</p> 
<p>It was then that he first thought of asking Sarah to marry him, and once the idea came to him, he found it nearly impossible to dismiss.&nbsp; Up ahead, Sarah and Jonah were tossing stones in a small creek, one after the next. Jonah then hopped over it, and Sarah followed.</p> 
<p>“C’mon!” she shouted. “We’re exploring!”</p> 
<p>“Yeah, Dad, hurry up!”</p> 
<p>“I’m coming—you don’t have to wait! I’ll catch up.”</p> 
<p>He didn’t rush to do so. Instead, he was lost in his thoughts as they continued to move farther and farther away, eventually vanishing behind a thick grove.&nbsp; Miles pushed his hands into his pockets.</p> 
<p>Marriage.</p> 
<p>It was still early in their relationship, of course, and he had no intention of dropping to his knees here and now to pop the question. At the same time, he suddenly knew that there would come a moment when he would. She was right for him; of that he was certain. And she was wonderful with Jonah. Jonah seemed to love her, and that, too, was important, because if Jonah hadn’t liked her, he wouldn’t even be considering what a future with Sarah might bring.&nbsp; And with that, something inside clicked, a key fitting neatly into a lock.&nbsp; Though he wasn’t even consciously aware of it, the question of “if” had become a question of “when.”</p> 
<p>With this decision, he unconsciously felt himself relax. He couldn’t see Sarah or Jonah as he crossed over the creek, but he followed the direction he’d last seen them going. A minute later he spotted them, and as he closed the distance between them, he realized he hadn’t been this happy in years.</p> 
<p>? ? ?</p> 
<p>From Thanksgiving Day through mid-December, Miles and Sarah grew even closer, both as lovers and as friends, their relationship blossoming into something deeper and more permanent.</p> 
<p>Miles also started dropping hints about their possible future together. Sarah wasn’t blind to what he really meant by his words; in fact, she found herself adding to his comments. Little things—when they were lying in bed, he might mention that he thought the walls should be repainted; Sarah would respond that a pale yellow might look cheery and they picked out the color together. Or Miles would mention that the garden needed some color and she’d say that she’d always loved camellias, and that’s what she’d plant if she lived here. That weekend, Miles planted five of the bushes along the front of the house.&nbsp; The file stayed in the closet, and for the first time in a long time, the present seemed more alive to Miles than the past. But what neither Sarah nor Miles could know was that although they were ready to put the past behind them, events would soon conspire to make that impossible.</p>
