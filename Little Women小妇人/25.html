Quite flushed with excitement were their ruddy faces, as they swung in the wind, whispering to one another what they had seen, for some peeped in at the dining room windows where the feast was spread, some climbed up to nod and smile at the sisters as they dressed the bride, others waved a welcome to those who came and went on various errands in garden, porch, and hall, and all, from the rosiest full-blown flower to the palest baby bud, offered their tribute of beauty and fragrance to the gentle mistress who had loved and tended them so long.</p> 
<p>Meg looked very like a rose herself, for all that was best and sweetest in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day, making it fair and tender, with a charm more beautiful than beauty. Neither silk, lace, nor orange flowers would she have. "I don't want a fashionable wedding, but only those about me whom I love, and to them I wish to look and be my familiar self."</p> 
<p>So she made her wedding gown herself, sewing into it the tender hopes and innocent romances of a girlish heart. Her sisters braided up her pretty hair, and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies of the valley, which 'her John' liked best of all the flowers that grew.</p> 
<p>"You do look just like our own dear Meg, only so very sweet and lovely that I should hug you if it wouldn't crumple your dress," cried Amy, surveying her with delight when all was done.</p> 
<p>"Then I am satisfied. But please hug and kiss me, everyone, and don't mind my dress. I want a great many crumples of this sort put into it today," and Meg opened her arms to her sisters, who clung about her with April faces for a minute, feeling that the new love had not changed the old.</p> 
<p>"Now I'm going to tie John's cravat for him, and then to stay a few minutes with Father quietly in the study," and Meg ran down to perform these little ceremonies, and then to follow her mother wherever she went, conscious that in spite of the smiles on the motherly face, there was a secret sorrow hid in the motherly heart at the flight of the first bird from the nest.</p> 
<p>As the younger girls stand together, giving the last touches to their simple toilet, it may be a good time to tell of a few changes which three years have wrought in their appearance, for all are looking their best just now.</p> 
<p>Jo's angles are much softened, she has learned to carry herself with ease, if not grace. The curly crop has lengthened into a thick coil, more becoming to the small head atop of the tall figure. There is a fresh color in her brown cheeks, a soft shine in her eyes, and only gentle words fall from her sharp tongue today.</p> 
<p>Beth has grown slender, pale, and more quiet than ever. The beautiful, kind eyes are larger, and in them lies an expression that saddens one, although it is not sad itself. It is the shadow of pain which touches the young face with such pathetic patience, but Beth seldom complains and always speaks hopefully of 'being better soon'.</p> 
<p>Amy is with truth considered 'the flower of the family', for at sixteen she has the air and bearing of a full-grown woman, not beautiful, but possessed of that indescribable charm called grace. One saw it in the lines of her figure, the make and motion of her hands, the flow of her dress, the droop of her hair, unconscious yet harmonious, and as attractive to many as beauty itself. Amy's nose still afflicted her, for it never would grow Grecian, so did her mouth, being too wide, and having a decided chin. These offending features gave character to her whole face, but she never could see it, and consoled herself with her wonderfully fair complexion, keen blue eyes, and curls more golden and abundant than ever.</p> 
<p>All three wore suits of thin silver gray (their best gowns for the summer), with blush roses in hair and bosom, and all three looked just what they were, fresh-faced, happy-hearted girls, pausing a moment in their busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest chapter in the romance of womanhood.</p> 
<p>There were to be no ceremonious performances, everything was to be as natural and homelike as possible, so when Aunt March arrived, she was scandalized to see the bride come running to welcome and lead her in, to find the bridegroom fastening up a garland that had fallen down, and to catch a glimpse of the paternal minister marching upstairs with a grave countenance and a wine bottle under each arm.</p> 
<p>"Upon my word, here's a state of things!" cried the old lady, taking the seat of honor prepared for her, and settling the folds of her lavender moire with a great rustle. "You oughtn't to be seen till the last minute, child."</p> 
<p>"I'm not a show, Aunty, and no one is coming to stare at me, to criticize my dress, or count the cost of my luncheon. I'm too happy to care what anyone says or thinks, and I'm going to have my little wedding just as I like it. John, dear, here's your hammer." And away went Meg to help 'that man' in his highly improper employment.</p> 
<p>Mr. Brooke didn't even say, "Thank you," but as he stooped for the unromantic tool, he kissed his little bride behind the folding door, with a look that made Aunt March whisk out her pocket handkerchief with a sudden dew in her sharp old eyes.</p> 
<p>A crash, a cry, and a laugh from Laurie, accompanied by the indecorous exclamation, "Jupiter Ammon! Jo's upset the cake again!" caused a momentary flurry, which was hardly over when a flock of cousins arrived, and 'the party came in', as Beth used to say when a child.</p> 
<p>"Don't let that young giant come near me, he worries me worse than mosquitoes," whispered the old lady to Amy, as the rooms filled and Laurie's black head towered above the rest.</p> 
<p>"He has promised to be very good today, and he can be perfectly elegant if he likes," returned Amy, and gliding away to warn Hercules to beware of the dragon, which warning caused him to haunt the old lady with a devotion that nearly distracted her.</p> 
<p>There was no bridal procession, but a sudden silence fell upon the room as Mr. March and the young couple took their places under the green arch. Mother and sisters gathered close, as if loath to give Meg up. The fatherly voice broke more than once, which only seemed to make the service more beautiful and solemn. The bridegroom's hand trembled visibly, and no one heard his replies. But Meg looked straight up in her husband's eyes, and said, "I will!" with such tender trust in her own face and voice that her mother's heart rejoiced and Aunt March sniffed audibly.</p> 
<p>Jo did not cry, though she was very near it once, and was only saved from a demonstration by the consciousness that Laurie was staring fixedly at her, with a comical mixture of merriment and emotion in his wicked black eyes. Beth kept her face hidden on her mother's shoulder, but Amy stood like a graceful statue, with a most becoming ray of sunshine touching her white forehead and the flower in her hair.</p> 
<p>It wasn't at all the thing, I'm afraid, but the minute she was fairly married, Meg cried, "The first kiss for Marmee!" and turning, gave it with her heart on her lips. During the next fifteen minutes she looked more like a rose than ever, for everyone availed themselves of their privileges to the fullest extent, from Mr. Laurence to old Hannah, who, adorned with a headdress fearfully and wonderfully made, fell upon her in the hall, crying with a sob and a chuckle, "Bless you, deary, a hundred times! The cake ain't hurt a mite, and everything looks lovely."</p> 
<p>Everybody cleared up after that, and said something brilliant, or tried to, which did just as well, for laughter is ready when hearts are light. There was no display of gifts, for they were already in the little house, nor was there an elaborate breakfast, but a plentiful lunch of cake and fruit, dressed with flowers. Mr. Laurence and Aunt March shrugged and smiled at one another when water, lemonade, and coffee were found to be to only sorts of nectar which the three Hebes carried round. No one said anything, till Laurie, who insisted on serving the bride, appeared before her, with a loaded salver in his hand and a puzzled expression on his face.</p> 
<p>"Has Jo smashed all the bottles by accident?" he whispered, "or am I merely laboring under a delusion that I saw some lying about loose this morning?"</p> 
<p>"No, your grandfather kindly offered us his best, and Aunt March actually sent some, but Father put away a little for Beth, and dispatched the rest to the Soldier's Home. You know he thinks that wine should be used only in illness, and Mother says that neither she nor her daughters will ever offer it to any young man under her roof."</p> 
<p>Meg spoke seriously and expected to see Laurie frown or laugh, but he did neither, for after a quick look at her, he said, in his impetuous way, "I like that! For I've seen enough harm done to wish other women would think as you do."</p> 
<p>"You are not made wise by experience, I hope?" and there was an anxious accent in Meg's voice.</p> 
<p>"No. I give you my word for it. Don't think too well of me, either, this is not one of my temptations. Being brought up where wine is as common as water and almost as harmless, I don't care for it, but when a pretty girl offers it, one doesn't like to refuse, you see."</p> 
<p>"But you will, for the sake of others, if not for your own. Come, Laurie, promise, and give me one more reason to call this the happiest day of my life."</p> 
<p>A demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate a moment, for ridicule is often harder to bear than self-denial. Meg knew that if he gave the promise he would keep it at all costs, and feeling her power, used it as a woman may for her friend's good. She did not speak, but she looked up at him with a face made very eloquent by happiness, and a smile which said, "No one can refuse me anything today."</p> 
<p>Laurie certainly could not, and with an answering smile, he gave her his hand, saying heartily, "I promise, Mrs. Brooke!"</p> 
<p>"I thank you, very, very much."</p> 
<p>"And I drink 'long life to your resolution', Teddy," cried Jo, baptizing him with a splash of lemonade, as she waved her glass and beamed approvingly upon him.</p> 
<p>So the toast was drunk, the pledge made and loyally kept in spite of many temptations, for with instinctive wisdom, the girls seized a happy moment to do their friend a service, for which he thanked them all his life.</p> 
<p>After lunch, people strolled about, by twos and threes, through the house and garden, enjoying the sunshine without and within. Meg and John happened to be standing together in the middle of the grass plot, when Laurie was seized with an inspiration which put the finishing touch to this unfashionable wedding.</p> 
<p>"All the married people take hands and dance round the new-made husband and wife, as the Germans do, while we bachelors and spinsters prance in couples outside!" cried Laurie, promenading down the path with Amy, with such infectious spirit and skill that everyone else followed their example without a murmur. Mr. and Mrs. March, Aunt and Uncle Carrol began it, others rapidly joined in, even Sallie Moffat, after a moment's hesitation, threw her train over her arm and whisked Ned into the ring. But the crowning joke was Mr. Laurence and Aunt March, for when the stately old gentleman chasseed solemnly up to the old lady, she just tucked her cane under her arm, and hopped briskly away to join hands with the rest and dance about the bridal pair, while the young folks pervaded the garden like butterflies on a midsummer day.</p> 
<p>Want of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close, and then people began to go.</p> 
<p>"I wish you well, my dear, I heartily wish you well, but I think you'll be sorry for it," said Aunt March to Meg, adding to the bridegroom, as he led her to the carriage, "You've got a treasure, young man, see that you deserve it."</p> 
<p>"That is the prettiest wedding I've been to for an age, Ned, and I don't see why, for there wasn't a bit of style about it," observed Mrs. Moffat to her husband, as they drove away.</p> 
<p>"Laurie, my lad, if you ever want to indulge in this sort of thing, get one of those little girls to help you, and I shall be perfectly satisfied," said Mr. Laurence, settling himself in his easy chair to rest after the excitement of the morning.</p> 
<p>"I'll do my best to gratify you, Sir," was Laurie's unusually dutiful reply, as he carefully unpinned the posy Jo had put in his buttonhole.</p> 
<p>The little house was not far away, and the only bridal journey Meg had was the quiet walk with John from the old home to the new. When she came down, looking like a pretty Quakeress in her dove-colored suit and straw bonnet tied with white, they all gathered about her to say 'good-by', as tenderly as if she had been going to make the grand tour.</p> 
<p>"Don't feel that I am separated from you, Marmee dear, or that I love you any the less for loving John so much," she said, clinging to her mother, with full eyes for a moment. "I shall come every day, Father, and expect to keep my old place in all your hearts, though I am married. Beth is going to be with me a great deal, and the other girls will drop in now and then to laugh at my housekeeping struggles. Thank you all for my happy wedding day. Goodby, goodby!"</p> 
<p>They stood watching her, with faces full of love and hope and tender pride as she walked away, leaning on her husband's arm, with her hands full of flowers and the June sunshine brightening her happy face--and so Meg's married life began.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>六月的那个早晨，覆盖游廊的玫瑰花儿们一大早便睁开了睡眼，露出灿烂的笑容。它们在艳阳下怒放，如同友好的小邻居，事实正是这样。花儿们激动得满脸通红，在风中摇曳摆动，窃窃私语，议论着它们所见之事。因为，一些花儿透过饭厅窗户窥视到那儿摆着宴席。另一些花儿往上攀着，笑着向正在打扮新娘的妹妹们点头致意，其他的花儿在招手欢迎那些忙这忙那，穿梭于花园、游廊、大厅的人们。所有的玫瑰，无论是鲜艳盛开的花朵，还是色彩最淡的蓓蕾，都以它们的美貌和芬芳向它们那和善的女主人致敬。女主人爱它们，照料它们已经很长时间了。</p> 
<p>梅格看上去就像一朵玫瑰，那天，心灵中最甜美的东西，似乎都荡漾在她脸上，使那张脸充满魅力、温柔，美丽无比。</p> 
<p>她不要丝绸衣服和花边，也不要山梅花。”今天我不想看上去和往日有什么不同，也不想盛装打扮，”她说，”我不要时髦的婚礼，只要身边我爱的人们。我希望，在他们眼里，我还是熟悉的老样子。”因此，她亲手缝制结婚礼服，将女孩心中温柔的希望与天真浪漫都缝进了礼服。妹妹们把她漂亮的头发辫成辫子，她身上唯一的装饰是山谷里的百合花。百花之中，”她的约翰"最钟爱百合。</p> 
<p>“你看上去真的就是我们家亲爱的梅格，只是太漂亮、太可爱了。要不是会把你衣服弄皱，我就要拥抱你了，”打扮完毕，艾美欣喜地打量着姐姐，叫了出来。</p> 
<p>“那我就满意了。可是，请你们每个人都来拥抱我，亲吻我。别管我的衣服，我今天想让衣服带上许许多多这样的折皱。”梅格向妹妹们伸出了胳膊，好一会儿妹妹们满面春风地依偎着姐姐，感到新的爱情并未改变昔日的姊妹之情。</p> 
<p>“好了，我得去为约翰系领带了。然后我要和爸爸在书房里安静地呆一会儿。“梅格跑下楼去行这些小小的礼节，之后便跟在妈妈的身前身后，一步不离。她意识到尽管妈妈脸上露着笑容，内心却隐藏着悲哀：鸟巢里的第一只鸟儿就要展翅高飞了。</p> 
<p>眼下，三个姑娘站在一起，为她们朴素的装扮做最后的修饰。我们正好利用这段时间描述一下三年时光给姑娘们的容颜带来的变化。此时此刻，所有的一切使她们看上去动人之极。</p> 
<p>乔的棱角已磨平了许多。她学会了虽不很优雅但也自如地展露风情。卷毛的小平头已长满密密长长的鬈发，目光柔和清亮。如今，从她那从不饶人的舌头上吐出来的只有轻柔的话语。</p> 
<p>贝思更加纤弱、苍白，也更加沉静。她那双美丽、友善的眼睛更大了。虽然这双眼睛本身并不悲伤，但眼神却让人伤感。痛苦的阴影触摸着年轻的脸庞，透出一种哀婉动人的坚韧。然而，贝思极少抱怨，总是充满希望地说"不久就会好起来"。</p> 
<p>艾美是名符其实的"家庭之花"。十六岁的她已经具有成熟女性的风韵举止 -说不上漂亮，但具有一种无法描绘的魅力。那是一种优雅的韵致。从她形体的曲线，从她的举手投足，从她衣服的平垂，头发的散落，人们都能发现这种魅力 —不是有意为之，却协调一致，如同美貌本身，对许多人产生了吸引力。艾美的鼻子仍使她痛苦，因为，鼻子决不会长直了。她的嘴巴也让她苦恼，嘴巴太阔，而且还有着一个坚毅的下巴。这些恼人的特征赋予她整个脸蛋以个性，而她却视而不见。她宽慰自己，她有着白皙的皮肤，敏锐的蓝眼睛，和比以前更浓密的金色鬈发。</p> 
<p>三个女孩都穿着银灰色的薄裙（她们最好的夏装），发辫和胸口都插着红色的玫瑰。三个人看上去都具有这个年龄女孩们应有的特征 -脸上透着活力，心中荡漾着幸福，在忙碌的生活中暂停片刻，带着渴望的眼神，阅读女子浪漫故事中最甜美的一章　。</p> 
<p>没有各种仪式，一切都尽可能地轻松自然。因此，当马奇婶婶到来时，看到眼前的一切不由大为震惊：新娘竟跑出来迎她，而新郎却忙着固定一只掉下来的花环，身为父亲的牧师则两只胳膊下各夹着一瓶酒一本正经地往楼上走。</p> 
<p>“嗳呀，真是乱七八糟！”老太太叫道，一屁股坐在为她准备的雅座上，摆弄着她那淡紫色波纹绸衣的皱褶，发出好一阵沙沙声，”孩子，要到最后一刻你才能被人看见埃”“婶子，我不是展品，没有人来盯着我看，评判我的衣服，或估算婚宴的费用。我太幸福了，顾不上别人怎么说、怎么想。我要以我喜欢的方式举行我的婚礼。约翰，亲爱的，给你锤子。”梅格就这样走开了，去帮"那人"干那件完全不适合他的工作。</p> 
<p>布鲁克先生甚至没有说声"谢谢"。但他弯腰去接那毫无浪漫色彩的工具时，在折门后吻了他的小新娘。那种景象使马奇婶婶急速掏出手帕，抹去突然涌进她锐利老眼的泪滴。</p> 
<p>哗啦一声，叫声，劳里的笑声，伴随着不雅的惊叹：“天啊！好家伙！乔又把蛋糕毁了！”引起了一阵忙乱。这边还没完，那边又来了一群堂表兄妹。正像贝思小时候常说的：“大队人马驾到。”“别让那小巨人靠近我。他比蚊子还让我烦，“马奇婶婶对艾美耳语道。屋子里挤满了人，而劳里的黑色头顶超出所有的人。</p> 
<p>“他答应过我今天好好表现。如果他愿意，他能做到非常优雅，”艾美回答道。她溜过去警告海格立斯当心这位严厉的婶婶，可警告倒使他一门心思缠住老太太，让老太太差点发疯。</p> 
<p>没有婚礼上常见的列队行进，但马奇先生和一对新人在绿色的拱门下站定时，屋里一片寂静。妈妈和妹妹们挨得紧紧的，好像极不情愿送走梅格。爸爸不止一次停下话来，这使得仪式更加美丽、庄严。新郎的手在颤抖，谁也没听清他的回答；然而，梅格直盯着丈夫的双眼说道：“我愿意！”她的面容、她的声音都带着温柔的信任，这让母亲感到欣慰，马奇婶婶却嗤之以鼻。</p> 
<p>乔没有哭，尽管差一点儿就哭出来。她意识到劳里正盯着她看，淘气的黑眼睛带着既欢乐又伤感的可笑神色。她这才忍住没哭。贝思把头埋在妈妈肩膀里。艾美站在那儿，就像一座优雅的雕像，一束阳光抚摸着她白皙的额角和头上的花束，好看极了。值得一提的还有很多，可婚礼一完，梅格哭了出来：“第一个吻给妈咪！”她转过身，用充满爱意的唇，吻了吻妈妈。接下来的十五分钟，她看上去愈发像一朵玫瑰了，因为从劳伦斯先生到罕娜嬷嬷，每个人都最大限度地利用这一特权。老罕娜围着条精巧的大头巾，在大厅里倚在梅格身上，又是哭又是笑，叫着：“祝福你，亲爱的，一百遍！</p> 
<p>蛋糕一点儿也没事，一切看上去都好。”然后大家都振奋起来，说了些或试着说些鼓舞人心的话。</p> 
<p>他们做得很好，轻快的心情容易产生笑声。没有展示礼物，因为礼物已经陈列在小屋中了；也没有精心烹制的早餐，但是午餐很丰盛，蛋糕、水果，全用鲜花装饰着。劳伦斯先生和马奇婶婶耸耸肩，相视而笑，他们发现三个斟酒女神。巡回传递的饮品只是水、柠檬汁和咖啡。但是谁也没吱声，直到劳里出现在新娘面前。他手端装满食物的托盘，脸上带着迷惑的神情，坚持让新娘吃东西。</p> 
<p>“是不是乔不慎把酒瓶都打碎了？”他轻声问，”或许我只是自找没趣，我早上看见地上有一些碎酒瓶。”“不是，你爷爷很客气，把他最好的酒拿来给我们了，而且，马奇婶婶也送过来一些。但是爸爸给贝思留了一些，将剩下的送给军人之家了。你知道，他认为只有生病时才能喝酒。妈妈说，她和她的女儿们都不会在家中用酒招待年轻人。”梅格认真地说着，她想劳里会皱眉或笑笑，但他既没皱眉也没笑，而是迅速地扫了她一眼，像他惯常一样冲动地说：“我喜欢那样。我看够了喝酒造成的危害，希望别的女人们也能像你们这样想。”“并不是经验使你变聪明的吧，我想。”梅格的语调含着担心。</p> 
<p>“不是，我保证。但也别把我想得太好。这不是我面临的一个诱惑。在我长大的地方，酒和水一样普遍，而且几乎无害。我不喜欢酒，但是，如果一个美丽的姑娘向你敬酒，你就不想拒绝了，是吧？”“可你会拒绝的，即使不为你自己，也要为别人着想。劳里，答应我，给我加条理由，让今天成为我一生中最幸福的日子。”这样突然、认真的请求使年轻人犹豫了一会，因为嘲弄比自我克制更难忍受。梅格知道，一旦他作出许诺，他将不顾一切遵守诺言。她感觉到了她的力量，为了朋友好，她以女人的方式运用了她的力量。她没有说话，抬头看着他。幸福使她的脸富于表情，她的笑容似乎在说：“今天谁也不能拒绝我的要求。”劳里当然不能。带着会意的笑容，他把手伸给她，由衷地说道：“我答应你，布鲁克太太。“谢谢你，非常感谢。”“为你的决心干杯，特迪，”乔叫着，倒了一杯柠檬汁为他洗礼。她摇着杯子，赞许地朝他微笑。</p> 
<p>就这样，祝了酒，发了誓，尽管有许多的诱惑，劳里还是忠实地遵守了诺言。女孩们有着本能的智慧，瞅准了这样一个幸福时刻为她们的朋友做了件好事，为此劳里终身感谢她们。</p> 
<p>午餐后，人们三三两两穿过房子、花园随意散步，享受着屋里屋外的阳光。梅格和约翰碰巧一起站在草地中央。劳里突然来了灵感，一下给这不时髦的婚礼最后润了色。</p> 
<p>“所有结了婚的拉起手来，围着新郎新娘跳舞，就像德国人那样，我们单身汉、未婚女在外围捉对跳！”劳里喊道，他正和艾美沿着小路散步。他的话很有技巧，极具感染力，大家毫无异议，跟着跳起来。马奇先生和马奇太太，卡罗尔叔叔和婶婶先开了头，别的人很快加入进去。萨莉·莫法特犹豫了一小会，也将裙裾搭在臂上，迅速将内德拖进舞圈。最可笑的是劳伦斯先生和马奇婶婶这一对。老先生跳着稳重庄严的快步过来邀请老太太，老太太将拐杖往胳膊下一夹，便轻快地随着老先生和其他人一起绕着新人跳起来。而年轻人们像仲夏时节的蝴蝶一样在花园里翩翩起舞。</p> 
<p>大家跳得气喘吁吁，即兴舞会这才结束。然后人们开始离开。</p> 
<p>“祝你幸福，亲爱的。衷心愿你一切都好，可我想不久你会后悔的，”马奇婶婶对梅格说。新郎送她上马车，她又接着说：“年轻人，你得了个宝贝，留神，你要配得上她。”“内德，这婚礼一点也不时髦，但这是我参加过的最美好的婚礼，也不知是为什么，”在驾车离开时，莫法特太太对丈夫这样评论道。</p> 
<p>“劳里，我的孩子，你如果也想享这种福，就在她们姐妹里头找一个来帮帮你，我会十分满意的，”上午的兴奋已过，劳伦斯先生一边说着，一边坐进安乐椅休息。</p> 
<p>“我会尽量让您满足的，先生，”劳里非比寻常地恭敬回答，一边仔细拿下乔为他别在钮扣孔的花束。</p> 
<p>小屋并不远，梅格的新婚之旅便是随着约翰静静地从老屋走向新房。她走下楼来，身着暖灰色的长裙，头戴系着白结的草帽，看上去就像个美丽的贵格会女教徒。大家都围过来，友爱地向他道别，仿佛她就要去作远途旅行。</p> 
<p>“亲爱的妈咪，别以为我和您分开了，别以为我这么爱约翰对您的爱就减少了，“她热泪盈眶地偎着妈妈说。过了一会儿，她又说：“爸，我每天都要回家。我是结了婚，可我想在你们大家心中保留老位置。贝思要常来陪伴我。乔和艾美要时常过来看我管家出洋相。大家让我度过了幸福的结婚日，谢谢，再见，再见！”大家脸上充满爱意、希望与自豪，站在那里目送梅格手捧鲜花，依偎着丈夫走远了。六月的阳光照亮了她幸福的面庞- 就这样，梅格的新婚生活开始了。</p>
