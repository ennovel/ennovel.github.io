Amy was learning this distinction through much tribulation, for mistaking enthusiasm for inspiration, she attempted every branch of art with youthful audacity. For a long time there was a lull in the 'mud-pie' business, and she devoted herself to the finest pen-and-ink drawing, in which she showed such taste and skill that her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant and profitable. But over-strained eyes caused pen and ink to be laid aside for a bold attempt at poker-sketching. While this attack lasted, the family lived in constant fear of a conflagration, for the odor of burning wood pervaded the house at all hours, smoke issued from attic and shed with alarming frequency, red-hot pokers lay about promiscuously, and Hannah never went to bed without a pail of water and the dinner bell at her door in case of fire. Raphael's face was found boldly executed on the underside of the moulding board, and Bacchus on the head of a beer barrel. A chanting cherub adorned the cover of the sugar bucket, and attempts to portray Romeo and Juliet supplied kindling for some time.</p> 
<p>From fire to oil was a natural transition for burned fingers, and Amy fell to painting with undiminished ardor. An artist friend fitted her out with his castoff palettes, brushes, and colors, and she daubed away, producing pastoral and marine views such as were never seen on land or sea. Her monstrosities in the way of cattle would have taken prizes at an agricultural fair, and the perilous pitching of her vessels would have produced seasickness in the most nautical observer, if the utter disregard to all known rules of shipbuilding and rigging had not convulsed him with laughter at the first glance. Swarthy boys and dark-eyed Madonnas, staring at you from one corner of the studio, suggested Murillo; oily brown shadows of faces with a lurid streak in the wrong place, meant Rembrandt; buxom ladies and dropiscal infants, Rubens; and Turner appeared in tempests of blue thunder, orange lightning, brown rain, and purple clouds, with a tomato-colored splash in the middle, which might be the sun or a bouy, a sailor's shirt or a king's robe, as the spectator pleased.</p> 
<p>Charcoal portraits came next, and the entire family hung in a row, looking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coalbin. Softened into crayon sketches, they did better, for the likenesses were good, and Amy's hair, Jo's nose, Meg's mouth, and Laurie's eyes were pronounced 'wonderfully fine'. A return to clay and plaster followed, and ghostly casts of her acquaintances haunted corners of the house, or tumbled off closet shelves onto people's heads. Children were enticed in as models, till their incoherent accounts of her mysterious doings caused Miss Amy to be regarded in the light of a young ogress. Her efforts in this line, however, were brought to an abrupt close by an untoward accident, which quenched her ardor. Other models failing her for a time, she undertook to cast her own pretty foot, and the family were one day alarmed by an unearthly bumping and screaming and running to the rescue, found the young enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed with her foot held fast in a pan full of plaster, which had hardened with unexpected rapidity. With much difficulty and some danger she was dug out, for Jo was so overcome with laughter while she excavated that her knife went too far, cut the poor foot, and left a lasting memorial of one artistic attempt, at least.</p> 
<p>After this Amy subsided, till a mania for sketching from nature set her to haunting river, field, and wood, for picturesque studies, and sighing for ruins to copy. She caught endless colds sitting on damp grass to book 'a delicious bit', composed of a stone, a stump, one mushroom, and a broken mullein stalk, or 'a heavenly mass of clouds', that looked like a choice display of featherbeds when done. She sacrificed her complexion floating on the river in the midsummer sun to study light and shade, and got a wrinkle over her nose trying after 'points of sight', or whatever the squint-and-string performance is called.</p> 
<p>If 'genius is eternal patience', as Michelangelo affirms, Amy had some claim to the divine attribute, for she persevered in spite of all obstacles, failures, and discouragements, firmly believing that in time she should do something worthy to be called 'high art'.</p> 
<p>She was learning, doing, and enjoying other things, meanwhile, for she had resolved to be an attractive and accomplished woman, even if she never became a great artist. Here she succeeded better, for she was one of those happily created beings who please without effort, make friends everywhere, and take life so gracefully and easily that less fortunate souls are tempted to believe that such are born under a lucky star. Everybody liked her, for among her good gifts was tact. She had an instinctive sense of what was pleasing and proper, always said the right thing to the right person, did just what suited the time and place, and was so self-possessed that her sisters used to say, "If Amy went to court without any rehearsal beforehand, she'd know exactly what to do."</p> 
<p>One of her weaknesses was a desire to move in 'our best society', without being quite sure what the best really was. Money, position, fashionable accomplishments, and elegant manners were most desirable things in her eyes, and she liked to associate with those who possessed them, often mistaking the false for the true, and admiring what was not admirable. Never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman, she cultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings, so that when the opportunity came she might be ready to take the place from which poverty now excluded her.</p> 
<p>"My lady," as her friends called her, sincerely desired to be a genuine lady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn that money cannot buy refinement of nature, that rank does not always confer nobility, and that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of external drawbacks.</p> 
<p>"I want to ask a favor of you, Mamma," Amy said, coming in with an important air one day.</p> 
<p>"Well, little girl, what is it?" replied her mother, in whose eyes the stately young lady still remained 'the baby'.</p> 
<p>"Our drawing class breaks up next week, and before the girls separate for the summer, I want to ask them out here for a day. They are wild to see the river, sketch the broken bridge, and copy some of the things they admire in my book. They have been very kind to me in many ways, and I am grateful, for they are all rich and I know I am poor, yet they never made any difference."</p> 
<p>"Why should they?" and Mrs. March put the question with what the girls called her 'Maria Theresa air'.</p> 
<p>"You know as well as I that it does make a difference with nearly everyone, so don't ruffle up like a dear, motherly hen, when your chickens get pecked by smarter birds. The ugly duckling turned out a swan, you know." and Amy smiled without bitterness, for she possessed a happy temper and hopeful spirit.</p> 
<p>Mrs. March laughed, and smoothed down her maternal pride as she asked, "Well, my swan, what is your plan?"</p> 
<p>"I should like to ask the girls out to lunch next week, to take them for a drive to the places they want to see, a row on the river, perhaps, and make a little artistic fete for them."</p> 
<p>"That looks feasible. What do you want for lunch? Cake, sandwiches, fruit, and coffee will be all that is necessary, I suppose?"</p> 
<p>"Oh, dear, no! We must have cold tongue and chicken, French chocolate and ice cream, besides. The girls are used to such things, and I want my lunch to be proper and elegant, though I do work for my living."</p> 
<p>"How many young ladies are there?" asked her mother, beginning to look sober.</p> 
<p>"Twelve or fourteen in the class, but I dare say they won't all come."</p> 
<p>"Bless me, child, you will have to charter an omnibus to carry them about."</p> 
<p>"Why, Mother, how can you think of such a thing? Not more than six or eight will probably come, so I shall hire a beach wagon and borrow Mr. Laurence's cherry-bounce." (Hannah's pronunciation of char-a-banc.)</p> 
<p>"All of this will be expensive, Amy."</p> 
<p>"Not very. I've calculated the cost, and I'll pay for it myself."</p> 
<p>"Don't you think, dear, that as these girls are used to such things, and the best we can do will be nothing new, that some simpler plan would be pleasanter to them, as a change if nothing more, and much better for us than buying or borrowing what we don't need, and attempting a style not in keeping with our circumstances?"</p> 
<p>"If I can't have it as I like, I don't care to have it at all. I know that I can carry it out perfectly well, if you and the girls will help a little, and I don't see why I can't if I'm willing to pay for it," said Amy, with the decision which opposition was apt to change into obstinacy.</p> 
<p>Mrs. March knew that experience was an excellent teacher, and when it was possible she left her children to learn alone the lessons which she would gladly have made easier, if they had not objected to taking advice as much as they did salts and senna.</p> 
<p>"Very well, Amy, if your heart is set upon it, and you see your way through without too great an outlay of money, time, and temper, I'll say no more. Talk it over with the girls, and whichever way you decide, I'll do my best to help you."</p> 
<p>"Thanks, Mother, you are always so kind." and away went Amy to lay her plan before her sisters.</p> 
<p>Meg agreed at once, and promised her aid, gladly offering anything she possessed, from her little house itself to her very best saltspoons. But Jo frowned upon the whole project and would have nothing to do with it at first.</p> 
<p>"Why in the world should you spend your money, worry your family, and turn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who don't care a sixpence for you? I thought you had too much pride and sense to truckle to any mortal woman just because she wears French boots and rides in a coupe," said Jo, who, being called from the tragic climax of her novel, was not in the best mood for social enterprises.</p> 
<p>"I don't truckle, and I hate being patronized as much as you do!" returned Amy indignantly, for the two still jangled when such questions arose. "The girls do care for me, and I for them, and there's a great deal of kindness and sense and talent among them, in spite of what you call fashionable nonsense. You don't care to make people like you, to go into good society, and cultivate your manners and tastes. I do, and I mean to make the most of every chance that comes. You can go through the world with your elbows out and your nose in the air, and call it independence, if you like. That's not my way."</p> 
<p>When Amy had whetted her tongue and freed her mind she usually got the best of it, for she seldom failed to have common sense on her side, while Jo carried her love of liberty and hate of conventionalities to such an unlimited extent that she naturally found herself worsted in an argument. Amy's definition of Jo's idea of independence was such a good hit that both burst out laughing, and the discussion took a more amiable turn. Much against her will, Jo at length consented to sacrifice a day to Mrs. Grundy, and help her sister through what she regarded as 'a nonsensical business'.</p> 
<p>The invitations were sent, nearly all accepted, and the following Monday was set apart for the grand event. Hannah was out of humor because her week's work was deranged, and prophesied that "ef the washin' and ironin' warn't done reg'lar, nothin' would go well anywheres". This hitch in the mainspring of the domestic machinery had a bad effect upon the whole concern, but Amy's motto was 'Nil desperandum', and having made up her mind what to do, she proceeded to do it in spite of all obstacles. To begin with, Hannah's cooking didn't turn out well. The chicken was tough, the tongue too salty, and the chocolate wouldn't froth properly. Then the cake and ice cost more than Amy expected, so did the wagon, and various other expenses, which seemed trifling at the outset, counted up rather alarmingly afterward. Beth got a cold and took to her bed. Meg had an unusual number of callers to keep her at home, and Jo was in such a divided state of mind that her breakages, accidents, and mistakes were uncommonly numerous, serious, and trying.</p> 
<p>If it was not fair on Monday, the young ladies were to come on Tuesday, an arrangement which aggravated Jo and Hannah to the last degree. On Monday morning the weather was in that undecided state which is more exasperating than a steady pour. It drizzled a little, shone a little, blew a little, and didn't make up its mind till it was too late for anyone else to make up theirs. Amy was up at dawn, hustling people out of their beds and through their breakfasts, that the house might be got in order. The parlor struck her as looking uncommonly shabby, but without stopping to sigh for what she had not, she skillfully made the best of what she had, arranging chairs over the worn places in the carpet, covering stains on the walls with homemade statuary, which gave an artistic air to the room, as did the lovely vases of flowers Jo scattered about.</p> 
<p>The lunch looked charming, and as she surveyed it, she sincerely hoped it would taste well, and that the borrowed glass, china, and silver would get safely home again. The carriages were promised, Meg and Mother were all ready to do the honors, Beth was able to help Hannah behind the scenes, Jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable as an absent mind, and aching head, and a very decided disapproval of everybody and everything would allow, and as she wearily dressed, Amy cheered herself with anticipations of the happy moment when, lunch safely over, she should drive away with her friends for an afternoon of artistic delights, for the 'cherry bounce' and the broken bridge were her strong points.</p> 
<p>Then came the hours of suspense, during which she vibrated from parlor to porch, while public opinion varied like the weathercock. A smart shower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the young ladies who were to arrive at twelve, for nobody came, and at two the exhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to consume the perishable portions of the feast, that nothing might be lost.</p> 
<p>"No doubt about the weather today, they will certainly come, so we must fly round and be ready for them," said Amy, as the sun woke her next morning. She spoke briskly, but in her secret soul she wished she had said nothing about Tuesday, for her interest like her cake was getting a little stale.</p> 
<p>"I can't get any lobsters, so you will have to do without salad today," said Mr. March, coming in half an hour later, with an expression of placid despair.</p> 
<p>"Use the chicken then, the toughness won't matter in a salad," advised his wife.</p> 
<p>"Hannah left it on the kitchen table a minute, and the kittens got at it. I'm very sorry, Amy," added Beth, who was still a patroness of cats.</p> 
<p>"Then I must have a lobster, for tongue alone won't do," said Amy decidedly.</p> 
<p>"Shall I rush into town and demand one?" asked Jo, with the magnanimity of a martyr.</p> 
<p>"You'd come bringing it home under your arm without any paper, just to try me. I'll go myself," answered Amy, whose temper was beginning to fail.</p> 
<p>Shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel traveling basket, she departed, feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled spirit and fit her for the labors of the day. After some delay, the object of her desire was procured, likewise a bottle of dressing to prevent further loss of time at home, and off she drove again, well pleased with her own forethought.</p> 
<p>As the omnibus contained only one other passenger, a sleepy old lady, Amy pocketed her veil and beguiled the tedium of the way by trying to find out where all her money had gone to. So busy was she with her card full of refractory figures that she did not observe a newcomer, who entered without stopping the vehicle, till a masculine voice said, "Good morning, Miss March," and, looking up, she beheld one of Laurie's most elegant college friends. Fervently hoping that he would get out before she did, Amy utterly ignored the basket at her feet, and congratulating herself that she had on her new traveling dress, returned the young man's greeting with her usual suavity and spirit.</p> 
<p>They got on excellently, for Amy's chief care was soon set at rest by learning that the gentleman would leave first, and she was chatting away in a peculiarly lofty strain, when the old lady got out. In stumbling to the door, she upset the basket, and--oh horror!--the lobster, in all its vulgar size and brilliancy, was revealed to the highborn eyes of a Tudor!</p> 
<p>"By Jove, she's forgotten her dinner!" cried the unconscious youth, poking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane, and preparing to hand out the basket after the old lady.</p> 
<p>"Please don't--it's--it's mine," murmured Amy, with a face nearly as red as her fish.</p> 
<p>"Oh, really, I beg pardon. It's an uncommonly fine one, isn't it?" said Tudor, with great presence of mind, and an air of sober interest that did credit to his breeding.</p> 
<p>Amy recovered herself in a breath, set her basket boldly on the seat, and said, laughing, "Don't you wish you were to have some of the salad he's going to make, and to see the charming young ladies who are to eat it?"</p> 
<p>Now that was tact, for two of the ruling foibles of the masculine mind were touched. The lobster was instantly surrounded by a halo of pleasing reminiscences, and curiosity about 'the charming young ladies' diverted his mind from the comical mishap.</p> 
<p>"I suppose he'll laugh and joke over it with Laurie, but I shan't see them, that's a comfort," thought Amy, as Tudor bowed and departed.</p> 
<p>She did not mention this meeting at home (though she discovered that, thanks to the upset, her new dress was much damaged by the rivulets of dressing that meandered down the skirt), but went through with the preparations which now seemed more irksome than before, and at twelve o'clock all was ready again. Feeling that the neighbors were interested in her movements, she wished to efface the memory of yesterday's failure by a grand success today, so she ordered the 'cherry bounce', and drove away in state to meet and escort her guests to the banquet.</p> 
<p>"There's the rumble, they're coming! I'll go onto the porch and meet them. It looks hospitable, and I want the poor child to have a good time after all her trouble," said Mrs. March, suiting the action to the word. But after one glance, she retired, with an indescribable expression, for looking quite lost in the big carriage, sat Amy and one young lady.</p> 
<p>"Run, Beth, and help Hannah clear half the things off the table. It will be too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single girl," cried Jo, hurrying away to the lower regions, too excited to stop even for a laugh.</p> 
<p>In came Amy, quite calm and delightfully cordial to the one guest who had kept her promise. The rest of the family, being of a dramatic turn, played their parts equally well, and Miss Eliott found them a most hilarious set, for it was impossible to control entirely the merriment which possessed them. The remodeled lunch being gaily partaken of, the studio and garden visited, and art discussed with enthusiasm, Amy ordered a buggy (alas for the elegant cherry-bounce), and drove her friend quietly about the neighborhood till sunset, when 'the party went out'.</p> 
<p>As she came walking in, looking very tired but as composed as ever, she observed that every vestige of the unfortunate fete had disappeared, except a suspicious pucker about the corners of Jo's mouth.</p> 
<p>"You've had a loverly afternoon for your drive, dear," said her mother, as respectfully as if the whole twelve had come.</p> 
<p>"Miss Eliott is a very sweet girl, and seemed to enjoy herself, I thought," observed Beth, with unusual warmth.</p> 
<p>"Could you spare me some of your cake? I really need some, I have so much company, and I can't make such delicious stuff as yours," asked Meg soberly.</p> 
<p>"Take it all. I'm the only one here who likes sweet things, and it will mold before I can dispose of it," answered Amy, thinking with a sigh of the generous store she had laid in for such an end as this.</p> 
<p>"It's a pity Laurie isn't here to help us," began Jo, as they sat down to ice cream and salad for the second time in two days.</p> 
<p>A warning look from her mother checked any further remarks, and the whole family ate in heroic silence, till Mr. March mildly observed, "salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients, and Evelyn . . ." Here a general explosion of laughter cut short the 'history of salads', to the great surprise of the learned gentleman.</p> 
<p>"Bundle everything into a basket and send it to the Hummels. Germans like messes. I'm sick of the sight of this, and there's no reason you should all die of a surfeit because I've been a fool," cried Amy, wiping her eyes.</p> 
<p>"I thought I should have died when I saw you two girls rattling about in the what-you-call-it, like two little kernels in a very big nutshell, and Mother waiting in state to receive the throng," sighed Jo, quite spent with laughter.</p> 
<p>"I'm very sorry you were disappointed, dear, but we all did our best to satisfy you," said Mrs. March, in a tone full of motherly regret.</p> 
<p>"I am satisfied. I've done what I undertook, and it's not my fault that it failed. I comfort myself with that," said Amy with a little quiver in her voice. "I thank you all very much for helping me, and I'll thank you still more if you won't allude to it for a month, at least."</p> 
<p>No one did for several months, but the word 'fete' always produced a general smile, and Laurie's birthday gift to Amy was a tiny coral lobster in the shape of a charm for her watch guard.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>人们花很长时间才能区分天赋和天才，有抱负的年轻男女尤其如此。艾美经过许多磨难才知道两者的区别。她误将热情当作灵感，带着年轻人的冒险心理尝试了各门艺术。有好长一段时间她的"泥饼"作坊停业了。她全身心地投入到极精细的钢笔画习作中，在这门艺术中展露出鉴赏力与技巧。</p> 
<p>她的雅致的作品令人合意且有利可图。但作钢笔画太伤眼睛，她收起了笔墨，又开始大胆地尝试烙画。</p> 
<p>在她进行工作品间，全家人始终害怕会有大火灾，因为屋子里整天弥漫着燃烧的木头气味，烟不时从阁楼、棚屋窜出来。地上乱放着烧红的拨火棍。罕娜睡觉前总是准备好一桶水，门边放好用餐铃，以防万一失火。拉斐尔的头像被醒目地烙在擀面板下面。酒神巴克斯给画在了脾酒桶盖上。一个唱歌的小天使装饰着糖罐。绘制罗密欧与朱丽叶的尝试，使燃烧持续了一段时间。</p> 
<p>手指灼痛了，从火到油彩便成了自然的转折。艾美热情丝毫不减地投入到绘画中。一个艺术家朋友用他废弃的调色板、刷子、水彩将艾美装备起来，艾美便开始涂抹，画出陆上海上从来见不到的田园风光、海洋景色。她画的牛群丑陋怪异，永远不要指望它们能在农市上获奖；她画的船只危险地颠簸，对一个最懂得航海的观众来说，第一眼看到这张全然不顾造船及帆缆准则的画幅，若不是笑得前仰后合，便会晕起船来。黝黑的男孩和黑眼睛的圣母从画室的一角凝视着你，暗示出牟利罗的风格；面孔上油腻的棕色阴影带着错位的俗艳条纹，这是伦勃朗的画法；丰满的妇女和浮肿的婴孩，则是鲁本斯的笔致；透纳的画风出现在描绘暴风雨的画面中：蓝色的雷、桔色的电、棕色的雨、紫色的云，中间飘洒着西红柿颜色的一块，可能是太阳或救生圈，也可能是海员的衬衫或国王的长袍，欣赏者爱怎么理解都行。</p> 
<p>随后艾美又搞起了木炭肖像画。全家人的肖像挂成一排，看上去毛草草、黑乎乎，仿佛是刚从煤箱里弄出来的。到画铅笔素描时，情况得以改善，画像的相似度不错，艾美的头发、乔的鼻子、梅格的嘴巴以及劳里的眼睛被宣布"极像"。</p> 
<p>紧接着，艾美又回头摆弄起粘土和石膏。艾美熟人们的模型幽灵般地出没于屋子的角角落落，要不便从壁橱架掉下来砸在人们头上。孩子们被诱来当模特，后来他们支离破碎地描述艾美神秘的做法，听起来她仿佛是个小女妖似的。可是一场不愉快的事故突然终止了她在这方面的努力，同时也熄灭了她的热情，有一度她制作其他模型失败了，便开始制作自己美丽的脚。一天，全家人被一种可怕的撞击声和叫声弄得惊恐万状，大家跑过来救援，发现年轻的艺术狂在棚屋里乱蹦乱跳，一只脚紧紧粘在满满一盆石膏里，石膏出人意料地那么快就变硬了。大家费力地、危险地将她挖了出来，因为乔挖掘时，笑得太厉害，刀子挖得太深，伤了那只可怜的脚，像艾美的艺术尝试一样，给艾美留下了永久的纪念。</p> 
<p>打那以后，艾美平静下来。可后来又迷上了风景素描，这使得她常去河边、田野、树林研究景色，她渴望能临摹遗迹。</p> 
<p>她坐在潮湿的草地上画下"美妙的随笔"，一块石头，一个树桩，一个蘑菇，一根折断的毛蕊花茎，或者"一大片祥云"，画下来就像是羽毛褥垫精疲。就这样她老是感冒。她在仲夏的烈日下泛舟河中研究光影，也不管这样会晒黑皮肤。她试着找准"视点"，也就是眯着眼睛调角度什么的，鼻子上弄出了皱纹也不在乎。</p> 
<p>米开朗琪罗曾断言：“天才就是永恒的耐心。”假如真的这样，那么艾美便具有这样非凡的气质。尽管她遇到了许多障碍，遭受了失败和挫折，她还是坚持下去了。她坚信总有一天她会创作出值得称为"高雅艺术"的作品。</p> 
<p>她学着，干着，同时也欣赏着别的东西。因为即便她成不了伟大的艺术家，她也决心成为一个迷人的有才艺的妇人。</p> 
<p>在这方面，她较为成功。她是那种生性乐天的人，那种人广交朋友，不用费力便可讨人喜欢，他们生活得优雅轻松，致使一些运气不佳的人认为他们是在幸运星照耀下降临人世的。艾美本能地知道做什么既讨人喜欢又恰如其分。她总是见什么人说什么话，而且会相机行事。她沉着冷静，姐姐们总是说：“即使艾美事先毫无准备，走上法庭她也完全知道怎样去做。”艾美的一个弱点是渴望打进"上流社会"。其实她并不确定到底什么是上流。在她看来，钱、地位、时髦的才艺、优雅的风度是最需要的。她喜欢和拥有这一切的人们来往，往往错将假的当成真的，赞美不该赞美的。她从未忘记她生来就是一个淑女，只因家道清贫而没有地位，于是她培养着贵族趣味和感情，随时准备打入上流社会。</p> 
<p>朋友们称她"贵夫人"，她自己也衷心希望能成为真正的贵夫人，但她也由衷地懂得，钱买不来优雅的性情，地位不能赋于人贵族气质。有些人外表上尽管失意，身上还是显示出纯正的教养。</p> 
<p>“妈妈，我想请你帮个忙，”一天，艾美走进家门，郑重其事地说。</p> 
<p>“噢，什么忙，小姑娘？”妈妈答道。在妈妈的眼里，这个高贵的年轻女士依旧是"宝宝"。</p> 
<p>“下星期我们绘画班放假，姑娘们将离开学校回家过暑假。我想在这之前邀请她们来我们家玩一天。她们很想看看这里的河，画下那座断桥，临摹我画册里的那些东西，她们对那些很欣赏。在很多方面她们对我都很好，我感激她们，因为她们都很富有，也知道我贫穷，但她们并没有对我另眼相待。”“她们怎么会这样呢？”妈妈带着姑娘们称之为"玛丽亚·特蕾西亚的神气"提出了问题。</p> 
<p>“你我都晓得，几乎每个人都确实嫌贫爱富。你也别学那可爱的抱鸡婆，看到小鸡崽遭到强鸟啄，便竖起羽毛发怒。要知道，丑小鸭也会变成天鹅的。”艾美温和地笑了笑。她有个好脾气，而且性格开朗。</p> 
<p>马奇太太笑起来，她按下做母亲的自尊心问道：“那么，我的天鹅，你打算怎样？”“我想下星期请姑娘们过来吃饭，带她们坐车去她们想看的地方，也可能去划船，为她们开一个艺术游园会。”“听起来能行。你准备用什么作午宴？得有蛋糕、三明治、水果和咖啡，是吧？”“噢，不，亲爱的！我们得吃冷舌肉、鸡、法国巧克力，还要冰淇淋。那些女孩们习惯吃这些东西。虽然我不过在挣钱糊口，我还是希望我的午宴优雅得体。”“有多少姑娘？”妈妈问，态度认真起来。</p> 
<p>“班里有十二或十四个，可我敢说她们不会都来。”“天哪！孩子，那你得包一辆车把她们接来。”“哎呀，妈，您想到哪儿去了。也可能只来六个或八个。</p> 
<p>这样，我只要租部旅行汽车，再借上劳伦斯先生的'樱木弹跳车'。”（罕娜就是这么念敞篷大马车的。）"这会花掉许多钱的，艾美。”“不太多，我已算过帐，我自己出钱。”“亲爱的，你可想过，这些女孩已习惯了这一切。我们尽力做到的对她们毫无新意。也许简单点的计划会更令她们满意。比方来点变化，尝试一种违反时尚的风格，这样，那些我们不需要的东西，就用不着去买呀借呀，对我们也许更好。”“要是不能按我的心意去办，我就根本不想办了。我晓得，假如你和姐姐们能帮一点忙，我会操办得很好。我不懂干嘛我自己愿意出钱还不能办，”艾美语气坚决地说，反对意见使她固执起来。</p> 
<p>马奇太太懂得，经验是良师。只要可能，她就让孩子们自己去从经验中吸取教训。要是孩子们不像在前面说的盐和山扁豆事件中那样拒不听取建议，她会乐意使教训变得轻一些。</p> 
<p>“那好，艾美，要是你一心一意这样做，你觉得这样不会花太多的钱和时间，不会太伤神，我就什么也不说了。去和姐姐们商量商量，不管你怎样决定，我都会尽力帮你的。”“谢谢您，妈，你总是这么好。”艾美走开去向姐姐们谈她的计划了。</p> 
<p>梅格当即应允，许诺帮忙，并乐意提供她所有的一切，从她的小屋到她最好的盐匙。然而乔皱着眉反对整个计划，一开头就不愿插手。</p> 
<p>“你到底为什么要花掉自己的钱，还要烦扰家人，把家里搞得天翻地覆，来讨好那一群一点也不喜欢你的女孩子们？我还以为你有足够的自尊心，不会因为哪个平常女子穿着法国靴子，坐着小轿车，就去向她献媚呢？”乔说道。她的小说正写到悲伤的高潮，给打断了，没一点儿情绪谈社交活动。</p> 
<p>“我没有献媚，而且我和你一样也讨厌受人恩惠，”艾美气愤地反驳。这两姐妹一碰到这种问题，还是要吵。”那些女孩就是喜欢我，我也喜欢她们。即便你胡说她们时髦不好，但她们非常友善，头脑清楚，又有天赋。你不在乎培养风度、情趣，进入上流社会，让别人喜欢你，可我在乎。我是说我要充分利用每一个到来的机会。要是愿意，你尽可过贫穷清高的日子，说那是自立，我不会那样。”一旦艾美磨快了舌锋，放开了思路，总是她占上风。她这一边总是合乎常理，而乔喜欢自由，讨厌习俗，争吵中又走极端，结果总是输。艾美给乔的自立观下的定义恰如其分，两个人都哈哈大笑起来。争论也转而温和了些。最后，乔完全违反了自己的意愿，同意放弃一天时间不去格伦迪夫人那儿，帮妹妹干完她认为"毫无意义的事情"。</p> 
<p>发出的请帖几乎都被收下了。这件大事准备在下星期一。</p> 
<p>罕娜不太高兴，因为她一周的工作给打乱了。她预言：“要是衣服不能按时洗、熨，所有事儿都会搅成一团糟。”家庭机器运转的这一关键处要是出了故障，可要令大家焦虑的。但是，艾美的格言是"决不绝望"，既然她抱定了主意这么做，就开始着手排除障碍干起来。首先，罕娜的烹调不能令人满意：鸡烧老了，舌肉太咸了，巧克力做得不对劲。接着，蛋糕和冰淇淋的花费超出了艾美的预算。马车和各种其他费用也是如此。开初算来似乎数目不大，结果算下来数字惊人。贝思感冒了卧床休息。梅格来的客人多出往日，出不了门。乔情绪对立，结果失手摔坏东西，引起事故，出的错又多又大，令人难堪。</p> 
<p>“要不是有妈帮忙，我那天根本过不了关，”艾美后来充满感激地回忆着，平时大家已完全忘了"那一季节最好笑的事"。</p> 
<p>那个星期一假如天气不好，小姑娘们就星期二来 -这样的安排让乔和罕娜恼火到极点。星期一早上，天气反复无常，比持续下雨更让人烦心。下了一点毛毛雨，出了会太阳，又刮了点风，等到稳定下来时，再作决定已为时过晚。艾美天刚亮就起床了，她逼着家人也早早起床，吃完早饭，这样好将屋子收拾得井井有条。她突然觉得客厅太破烂不堪了，顾不上为她缺少的东西叹息，便很有技巧地充分利用起她所拥有的东西。她在地毯的破旧处安放些椅子，用常春藤镶边的画儿遮着墙上的污迹，用自制的雕像填充空荡的屋角。乔将插着鲜花的花瓶四处乱放着，这一来，屋子里有了一种艺术格调。</p> 
<p>她审视了准备好的午餐，看上去不错。她由衷希望吃起来味道也好，希望能安安全全地将借用的杯子、瓷器、银餐具拿回去。车子有了着落，梅格和妈妈都准备好效劳，贝思可以在厨房帮罕娜，乔答应像没事儿似地做出愉快可亲的样子，她坚决反对这让人头痛的一切，可总还得迁就她。艾美一边疲倦地打扮着，一边企盼着幸福的时刻。顺利地用毕午餐后，她将领着朋友们坐车去过一下艺术瘾：那"樱木弹跳车"和断桥是她值得炫耀的东西。想到这些，艾美情绪又好了起来。</p> 
<p>接下来的两小时让人焦虑不安。艾美来来回回地从客厅晃到游廊，大家对客人是否会来意见不一，像风标一样变化不停。姑娘们应在十二点到达的，可十一点时下了一场阵雨，显然这雨浇灭了她们的热情。一个人也没来。两点了，烈日炎炎，精疲力尽的一家人坐下来将午宴中易馊的食物吃掉，免得浪费。</p> 
<p>“今天天气不会有问题，她们肯定会来。我们得忙起来，作好准备，”第二天早上，艾美被太阳一照醒便说。她嘴上说得轻快，心下却暗暗后悔不该说星期二的话。她的兴趣和那蛋糕一样有点不新鲜了。</p> 
<p>“我买不到龙虾，今天你们将就着不吃色拉吧，”半小时后，马奇先生进屋，神色沮丧却平和地说。</p> 
<p>“那就用鸡肉吧，鸡肉老一点做色拉不影响，”他夫人建议道。</p> 
<p>“罕娜把鸡在厨房桌上放了一小会，小猫们舔过了。艾美，我真抱歉，”贝思接了茬。她仍然是猫们的女施主。</p> 
<p>“那我非得要龙虾，光是舌肉是不行的，”艾美口气坚决地说。</p> 
<p>“要不要我赶去镇上买一只来？”乔问，显出殉道者的宽宏大量。</p> 
<p>“你会不用纸包，把龙虾夹在胳膊下就带回来，让我不放心。我自己去，”艾美答道，她已开始忍不住脾气了。</p> 
<p>她披上厚面纱，拎着个时髦的旅行篮子出发了，心下想着乘车凉快一下能平息怒气，也好应付今天的劳作。耽搁了一些时候，要买的都买了，还买了一瓶调味品，以防家里没有又再浪费时间。她坐上回程的车，为她的先见之明庆幸。旅行车里另外只有一个打着盹的老太太。艾美将面纱放进口袋，试着核算出钱都花到哪里去了，以打发沉闷的旅途时光。她手持划满复杂数字的卡片，忙得不亦乐乎，竟没注意又上来了旅客。这个人没喊停车。艾美只听到一个男性的声音：“早上好，马奇小姐。”她抬头见是劳里的一个最文雅的大学朋友。</p> 
<p>艾美强烈地希望他在她前面下车，她完全不管脚边的篮子了。</p> 
<p>她庆幸自己穿的是新的旅行服装。她以平常的温顺心性向年轻人回了早安。</p> 
<p>他们谈得很投机，因为艾美得知这位先生将先下车，她最担心的事也就不怕了。她以一种特别高贵的语气谈个不停，就在这时，老太太要下车了。她蹒跚着走向车门，把篮子给打翻了- 哎哟，糟糕！ -形象俗艳的龙虾一下子暴露在这位仿佛都铎王朝王室成员般高贵的人的眼前。</p> 
<p>“天哪，她忘了带走午饭，”年轻人不知真相，叫了起来。</p> 
<p>他用手杖将鲜红的龙虾弄回原处，准备将篮子递给老太太。</p> 
<p>“请别--这是--这是我的，”艾美咕哝着，脸红得像龙虾。</p> 
<p>“噢，真的，请原谅。这龙虾真是不错，是不？”“都铎"沉着镇定，依然兴致勃勃而又认真地说着，显得很有教养。</p> 
<p>艾美很快恢复了镇静，她勇敢地将篮子放在了座位上，笑着说：“你难道不想尝用它做的色拉，再见见那些享用它的迷人的年轻姑娘们？”这样说很机智，因为触到了男人的两个主要弱点：龙虾立即罩上了逗人遐想的光环，对"迷人的年轻姑娘们"的好奇也使他不再注意这喜剧式的不幸事件。</p> 
<p>“我想他会和劳里一起笑话这件事的，可我听不到，这就没关系了，”当"都铎"向她鞠躬告别时，她这么想着。</p> 
<p>回到家她没有提起这场相遇（虽然她发现因为篮子翻了，调味汁顺着衣服曲曲弯弯流到裙子上，把新衣服给毁了）。她做着各种准备，现在这些准备工作似乎更令人厌倦了。十二点，一切就绪。艾美感到邻居们对她的行动产生了兴趣，因此极希望今天能大获成功，以抹去昨天失败的记忆。她叫来了"樱木弹跳车"，昂然驶去载接客人们赴宴。</p> 
<p>“听到轱辘声了，她们来了。我到游廊去迎接，这样礼节周到些。这可怜的孩子遇到这么多麻烦，我要让她玩得开心，”马奇太太一边说一边往游廊走去。可是，她往外瞥了一眼，便退了回来，脸上表情无法言传，因为在那大大的车厢里，仅仅坐着表情茫然的艾美和一个姑娘。</p> 
<p>“贝思，快跑去帮罕娜撤下桌上的一半食物。把供给十二个人吃的午餐放在一个女孩面前太荒唐了，”乔叫着，匆匆走到隐蔽处，激动得顾不上停下来笑个够。</p> 
<p>艾美进来了，她相当镇定，极快乐地热情招待这个唯一遵守诺言的客人。家庭其他成员都有戏剧表演的才能，因此各自的角色都扮演得很好。埃利奥特小姐发现这一家人很有趣，洋溢在他们身上的欢乐情绪无法抑制。愉快地用完调整过的午餐，看过画室与花园，热烈地讨论了艺术，艾美叫了部双轮轻便马车（哎呀，可惜了，那豪华的樱木弹跳车！），带着朋友静静地观赏周围景色，直到日落时分，这时"大队人马退场"。</p> 
<p>艾美走进屋，看上去很疲惫，但是镇静如常。她看到除去乔嘴角有一条可疑的皱纹外，这个倒霉的招待会没留下一丝痕迹。</p> 
<p>“你们下午驾车玩得开心吧，亲爱的？”妈妈殷勤地问道，好像十二个女孩都来了一样。</p> 
<p>“埃利奥特小姐很甜。我想，她看上去玩得很开心，”贝思带着难得的热情评论道。</p> 
<p>“能把蛋糕分给我一些吗？我客人不少，确实需要些，我做不出味道这样好的蛋糕，”梅格认真地问。</p> 
<p>“都拿去吧，这边只我一个人爱吃甜食，吃不掉会长霉的，”艾美回答，想到那样充足的准备落了这么个结局，不由叹了口气。</p> 
<p>“真可惜，劳里不在这里，不能帮忙，”乔说道。大家坐下来，两天中第二次吃冰淇淋和色拉。</p> 
<p>妈妈使了个警告的眼色，止住乔不再说话，全家人默默地大吃起来，后来马奇先生委婉地说道：“色拉是古人最爱吃的一道菜，伊夫林- "话没说完，众人爆发出一阵大笑，打断了"色拉的历史"，让博学的先生大为惊讶。</p> 
<p>“把所有东西都装到篮子里送给赫梅尔一家吧，德国人喜欢杂烩。我见到这些就作呕。我当了回傻瓜，可没有理由让你们吃得过多噎死。”艾美擦着眼睛哭起来。</p> 
<p>“当我看到你们两个女孩坐在那个你叫什么来着的车里颠簸，就像一个大坚果里的两个小果仁，而妈妈却郑重其事地准备迎候一群客人时。我真是要笑死了，“乔叹息着说，身子笑得发软。</p> 
<p>“你感到失望我真难过，亲爱的，可我们大家都尽了力让你满意。”马奇太太语调里充满了母亲的遗憾。</p> 
<p>“我确实满意了。我已做了我答应做的事。聊以自慰的是，失败不是我的错，“艾美声音有点发颤地说，”非常感谢大家的帮助，可要是你们不再提起这事，我更感谢你们，一个月，至少。”有好几个月没人提起这件事。但是，一说到"招待会"这个字眼，大家都会笑起来。劳里送给艾美的生日礼物是一个挂表链的装饰品 -小珊瑚龙虾。</p>
