He did not feel capable of saying anything. Greg didn't say anything, either, giving him time to think. Tom Greenleaf, of course, was no spring chicken; he was Dave Newsome's senior by at least three and perhaps as many as six years. But neither was he senile.</p> 
<p>'Jesus,' Mort said at last. He spoke very softly. The truth was, he felt a little winded.</p> 
<p>'My idea,' Greg said diffidently, 'was maybe Tom was the one who got a little mixed up. You know he's not exactly -'</p> 
<p>'A spring chicken,' Mort finished. 'I know it. But if there's anybody in Tashmore with a better eye for strangers than Tom, I don't know who it is. He's been remembering strangers all his life, Greg. That's one of the things caretakers do, right?' He hesitated, then burst out: 'He looked at us! He looked right at both of us!'</p> 
<p>Carefully, speaking as if he were only joshing, Greg said: 'Are you sure you didn't just dream this fella, Mort?'</p> 
<p>'I hadn't even considered it,' Mort said slowly, 'until now. If none of this happened, and I'm running around telling people it did, I guess that would make me crazy.'</p> 
<p>'Oh, I don't think that at all,' Greg said hastily.</p> 
<p>'I do,' Mort replied. He thought: But maybe that's what he really wants. To make people think you are crazy. And, maybe in the end, to make what people think the truth.</p> 
<p>Oh yes. Right. And he partnered up with old Tom Greenleaf to do the job. In fact, it was probably Tom who went up to Derry and burned the house, while Shooter stayed down here and wasted the cat - right?</p> 
<p>Now, think about it. Really THINK. Was he there? Was he REALLY?</p> 
<p>So Mort thought about it. He thought about it harder than he had ever thought about anything in his life; harder, even, than he had thought about Amy and Ted and what he should do about them after he had discovered them in bed together on that day in May. Had he hallucinated John Shooter?</p> 
<p>He thought again of the speed with which Shooter had grabbed him and thrown him against the side of the car.</p> 
<p>'Greg?'</p> 
<p>'I'm here, Mort.'</p> 
<p>'Tom didn't see the car, either? Old station wagon, Mississippi plates?'</p> 
<p>'He says he didn't see a car on Lake Drive at all yesterday. just you, standing up by the end of the path that goes down to the lake. He thought you were admiring the view.'</p> 
<p>Is it live, or is it Memorex?</p> 
<p>He kept coming back to the hard grip of Shooter's hands on his upper arms, the speed with which the man had thrown him against the car. 'You lie,' Shooter had said. Mort had seen the rage chained in his eyes, and had smelled dry cinnamon on his breath.</p> 
<p>His hands.</p> 
<p>The pressure of his hands.</p> 
<p>'Greg, hold the phone a sec.'</p> 
<p>'Sure.'</p> 
<p>Mort put the receiver down and tried to roll up his shirtsleeves. He was not very successful, because his hands were shaking badly. He unbuttoned the shirt instead, pulled it off, then held out his arms. At first he saw nothing. Then he rotated them outward as far as they would go, and there they were, two yellowing bruises on the inside of each arm, just above the elbow.</p> 
<p>The marks made by John Shooter's thumbs when he grabbed him and threw him against the car.</p> 
<p>He suddenly thought he might understand, and was afraid. Not for himself, though.</p> 
<p>For old Tom Greenleaf.</p>
