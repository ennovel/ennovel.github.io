He approached it gingerly, suddenly wishing he had a phone answering machine after all. They did have at least one sterling quality: you could monitor incoming calls and separate friend from foe.</p> 
<p>He stood over it irresolutely, thinking how much he disliked the sound modern telephones made. Once upon a time they had rung - jingled merrily, even. Now they made a shrill ululating noise that sounded like a migraine headache trying to happen.</p> 
<p>Well, are you going to pick it up or just stand here listening to it do that?</p> 
<p>I don't want to talk to him again. He scares me and he infuriates me, and I don't know which feeling I dislike more.</p> 
<p>Maybe it's not him.</p> 
<p>Maybe it is.</p> 
<p>Listening to those two thoughts go around and around was even worse than listening to the warbling beep-yawp of the phone, so he picked it up and said hello gruffly and it was, after all, no one more dangerous than his caretaker, Greg Carstairs.</p> 
<p>Greg asked the now-familiar questions about the house and Mort answered them all again, reflecting that explaining such an event was very similar to explaining a sudden death - if anything could get you over the shock, it was the constant repetition of the known facts.</p> 
<p>'Listen, Mort, I finally caught up with Tom Greenleaf late this afternoon,' Greg said, and Mort thought Greg sounded a little funny - a little cautious. 'He and Sonny Trotts were painting the Methodist Parish Hall.'</p> 
<p>'Uh-huh? Did you speak to him about my buddy?'</p> 
<p>'Yeah, I did,' Greg said. He sounded more cautious than ever.</p> 
<p>'Well?'</p> 
<p>There was a short pause. Then Greg said, 'Tom thought you must have been mixed up on your days.'</p> 
<p>'Mixed up on my ... what do you mean?'</p> 
<p>'Well,' Greg said apologetically, 'he says he did swing down Lake Drive yesterday afternoon and he did see you; he said he waved to you and you waved back. But, Mort -'</p> 
<p>'What?' But he was afraid he already knew what.</p> 
<p>'Tom says you were alone,' Greg finished.</p>
