But that one didn't look like an ordinary party."
<br> 
<br> Norma stood her ground in front of the desk. This, after all, was important "But, Dr. Haenlingen, we—"
<br> 
<br> "Don't try to persuade me," the little old woman said sharply. "Don't try to cozen me into something: I know all the tricks, Norma. I invented a good third of them, and it's been a long time since I had to use a textbook to remember the rest."
<br> 
<br> "I'm not trying to persuade you of anything." The woman wouldn't listen, that was the whole trouble: in the harsh bright light of morning she sat like a stone statue, casting a shadow of black on the polished desk. This was Dr. Haenlingen—and how did you talk to Dr. Haenlingen? But it was important, Norma reminded herself again: it was perfectly possible that the entire group of people at the party would be downgraded, or at the least get marked down on their records. "But we weren't doing anything harmful. If you have a party you've got to expect people to—oh, to get over-enthusiastic, maybe. But certainly there was nothing worth getting angry about. There was—"
<br> 
<br> "I'm sure you've thought all this out," Dr. Haenlingen said tightly. "You seem to have your case well prepared, and it would be a pleasure to listen to you."
<br> 
<br> "But—"
<br> 
<br> "Unfortunately," the woman continued in a voice like steel, "I have a great deal of work to do this morning."
<br> 
<br> "Dr. Haenlingen—"
<br> 
<br> "I'm sorry," she said, but she didn't sound sorry in the least. Her eyes went down to a pile of papers on the desk. A second passed.
<br> 
<br> "You've got to listen to me," Norma said. "What you're doing is unfair."
<br> 
<br> Dr. Haenlingen didn't look up. "Oh?"
<br> 
<br> "They were just—having fun," Norma said. "There was nothing wrong, nothing at all. You happened to come in at a bad moment, but it didn't mean anything, there wasn't anything going on that should have bothered you...."
<br> 
<br> "Perhaps not," Dr. Haenlingen said. "Unfortunately, what bothers me is not reducible to rule."
<br> 
<br> "But you're going to act on it," Norma said. "You're going to—"
<br> 
<br> "Yes?" Dr. Haenlingen said. "What am I going to do?"
<br> 
<br> "Well, you—"
<br> 
<br> "Downgrade the persons who were there?" Dr. Haenlingen asked. "Enter remarks in the permanent records? Prevent promotion? Just what am I supposed to have in mind?"
<br> 
<br> "Well, I thought—I—"
<br> 
<br> "I plan," Dr. Haenlingen said, "nothing whatever. Not just at present. I want to think about what I saw, about the people I saw. At present, nothing more."
<br> 
<br> There was a little silence. Norma felt herself relax. Then she asked: "At present?"
<br> 
<br> Dr. Haenlingen looked up at her, the eyes ice-cold and direct. "What action I determine to take," she said, "will be my responsibility. Mine alone. I do not intend to discuss it, or to attempt to justify it, to you or to anyone."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, Dr. Haenlingen." Norma stood awkwardly. "Thank you—"
<br> 
<br> "Don't thank me—yet," Dr. Haenlingen said. "Go and do your own work. I've got quite a lot to oversee here." She went back to her papers. Norma turned, stopped and then walked to the door. At the door she turned again but Dr. Haenlingen was paying no visible attention to her. She opened the door, went out and closed it behind her.
<br> 
<br> In the corridor she took one deep breath and then another.
<br> 
<br> The trouble was, you couldn't depend on the woman to do anything. She meant exactly what she had said: "For the present." And who could tell what might happen later?
<br> 
<br> Norma headed for her own cubicle, where she ignored the papers and the telephone messages waiting for her and reached for the intercom button instead. She pushed it twice and a voice said:
<br> 
<br> "What happened?"
<br> 
<br> "It's not good, Greta," Norma said. "It's—well, undecided, anyhow: we've got that much going for us."
<br> 
<br> "Undecided?" the voice asked.
<br> 
<br> "She said she wouldn't do anything—yet. But she left it open."
<br> 
<br> "Oh. Lord. Oh, my."
<br> 
<br> Norma nodded at the intercom speaker. "That's right. Anything's possible—you know what she's like."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, Lord. Do I."
<br> 
<br> "And—Greta, why did you have to be there, right by the door, with that strange type—as if it had been set up for her? Right in front of her eyes...."
<br> 
<br> "An accident," Greta said. "A pure by-God accident. When she walked in, when I saw her, believe me, Norma, my blood ran absolutely cold. Temperature of ice, or something colder than ice."
<br> 
<br> "Just that one look, just that one long look around." Norma said, "and she was gone. As if she'd memorized us, every one of us, filed the whole thing away and didn't need to see any more."
<br> 
<br> "I would have explained. But there wasn't any time."
<br> 
<br> "I know," Norma said. "Greta, who was he, anyhow?"
<br> 
<br> "Him?" Greta said. "Who knows? A friend of Cendar's—you know Cendar, don't you?"
<br> 
<br> "Albin Cendar?"
<br> 
<br> "That's the one. He—"
<br> 
<br> "But he's not from Psych." Norma said.
<br> 
<br> "Neither is his friend, I guess," Greta said. "But they come over, you know that—Cendar's always around."
<br> 
<br> "And you had to invite them...."
<br> 
<br> "Invite?" Greta said. "I didn't invite anybody. They were there, that's all. Cendar always shows up. You know that."
<br> 
<br> "Great," Nonna said. "So last night he had to bring a friend and the friend got grabby—"
<br> 
<br> "No," Greta said. "He was—well, confused maybe. Never been to a party of ours before, or anyhow not that I remember. I was trying to—loosen him up."
<br> 
<br> "You loosened everybody up," Norma said.
<br> 
<br> There was a silence.
<br> 
<br> "I'm sorry," Norma said. "All right. You couldn't have known—"
<br> 
<br> "I didn't know anything," Greta's voice said. "She was there, that's all."
<br> 
<br> "I wonder whether Dr. Haenlingen knew him," Norma said. "The new one, I mean."
<br> 
<br> "His name was Johnny something," Greta said.
<br> 
<br> "We'll just have to wait and find out," Norma said. "Whatever she's going to do, there isn't any way to stop it. I did the best I could—"
<br> 
<br> "Sure you did," Greta said. "We know that. Sure."
<br> 
<br> "Cendar and his friends—" Norma began.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, forget about that," Greta said. "Who cares about them?"
