Long secondspassed, then a little noise--the knob of the passage doorturning. As the door swung open, there came a gasping breathfrom Mary, for she saw framed in the faint light that came fromthe single burner in the corridor the slender form of herhusband, Dick Gilder. In the next instant he had stepped withinthe room and pulled to the door behind him. And in that sameinstant Chicago Red had pounced on his victim, the huge handclapped tight over the young man's mouth. Even as his powerfularm held the newcomer in an inescapable embrace, there came asound of scuffling feet and that was all. Finally the big man'svoice came triumphantly.</p> 
<p>　　"I've got him.""It's Dick!" The cry came as a wail of despair from the girl.</p> 
<p>　　At the same moment, Garson flashed his torch, and the light fellswiftly on young Gilder, bowed to a kneeling posture before thecouch, half-throttled by the strength of Chicago Red. Closebeside him, Mary looked down in wordless despair over this finaldisaster of the night. There was silence among the men, all ofwhom save the captor himself were gathered near the fireplace.</p> 
<p>　　Garson retired a step farther before he spoke his command, sothat, though he held the torch still, he like the others was inshadow. Only Mary was revealed clearly as she bent in alarmtoward the man she had married. It was borne in on the forger'sconsciousness that the face of the woman leaning over theintruder was stronger to hold the prisoner and to prevent anyoutcry than the might of Chicago Red himself, and so he gave theorder.</p> 
<p>　　"Get away, Red."The fellow let go his grip obediently enough, though with atrifle of regret, since he gloried in his physical prowess.</p> 
<p>　　Thus freed of that strangling embrace, Dick stumbled blindly tohis feet. Then, mechanically, his hand went to the lamp on thetable back of the couch. In the same moment Garson snapped historch to darkness. When, after a little futile searching, Dickfinally found the catch, and the mellow streamed forth, heuttered an ejaculation of stark amazement, for his gaze wasriveted on the face of the woman he loved.</p> 
<p>　　"Good God!" It was a cry of torture wrung from his soul of souls.</p> 
<p>　　Mary swayed toward him a little, palpitant with fear --fear forherself, for all of them, most of all for him.</p> 
<p>　　"Hush! hush!" she panted warningly. "Oh, Dick, you don'tunderstand."Dick's hand was at his throat. It was not easy for him to speakyet. He had suffered severely in the process of being throttled,and, too, he was in the clutch of a frightful emotion. To findher, his wife, in this place, in such company--her, the womanwhom he loved, whom, in spite of everything, he had honored, thewoman to whom he had given his name! Mary here! And thus!</p> 
<p>　　"I understand this," he said brokenly at last. "Whether you everdid it before or not, this time you have broken the law." Asudden inspiration on his own behalf came to him. For his love'ssake, he must seize on this opportunity given of fate to him formastery. He went on with a new vehemence of boldness that becamehim well.</p> 
<p>　　"You're in my hands now. So are these men as well. Unless you doas I say, Mary, I'll jail every one of them."Mary's usual quickness was not lacking even now, in this periodof extremity. Her retort was given without a particle ofhesitation.</p> 
<p>　　"You can't," she objected with conviction. "I'm the only oneyou've seen.""That's soon remedied," Dick declared. He turned toward the halldoor as if with the intention of lighting the chandelier.</p> 
<p>　　But Mary caught his arm pleadingly.</p> 
<p>　　"Don't, Dick," she begged. "It's--it's not safe.""I'm not afraid," was his indignant answer. He would have goneon, but she clung the closer. He was reluctant to use over-muchforce against the one whom he cherished so fondly.</p> 
<p>　　There came a diversion from the man who had made the capture, whowas mightily wondering over the course of events, which waswholly unlike anything in the whole of his own rather extensivehousebreaking experience.</p> 
<p>　　"Who's this, anyhow?" Chicago Red demanded.</p> 
<p>　　There was a primitive petulance in his drawling tones.</p> 
<p>　　Dick answered with conciseness enough.</p> 
<p>　　"I'm her husband. Who are you?"Mary called a soft admonition.</p> 
<p>　　"Don't speak, any of you," she directed. "You mustn't let himhear your voices."Dick was exasperated by this persistent identification of herselfwith these criminals in his father's house.</p> 
<p>　　"You're fighting me like a coward," he said hotly. His voice wasbitter. The eyes that had always been warm in their glances onher were chill now. He turned a little way from her, as if ininstinctive repugnance. "You are taking advantage of my love.</p> 
<p>　　You think that because of it I can't make a move against thesemen. Now, listen to me, I----""I won't!" Mary cried. Her words were shrill with mingledemotions. "There's nothing to talk about," she went on wildly.</p> 
<p>　　"There never can be between you and me."The young man's voice came with a sonorous firmness that was newto it. In these moments, the strength of him, nourished bysuffering, was putting forth its flower. His manner wasmasterful.</p> 
<p>　　"There can be and there will be," he contradicted. He raised hisvoice a little, speaking into the shadows where was the group ofsilent men.</p> 
<p>　　"You men back there!" he cried. "If I give you my word to letevery one of you go free and pledge myself never to recognize oneof you again, will you make Mary here listen to me? That's all Iask. I want a few minutes to state my case. Give me that.</p> 
<p>　　Whether I win or lose, you men go free, and I'll forgeteverything that has happened here to-night." There came amuffled guffaw of laughter from the big chest of Chicago Red atthis extraordinarily ingenuous proposal, while Dacey chuckledmore quietly.</p> 
<p>　　Dick made a gesture of impatience at this open derision.</p> 
<p>　　"Tell them I can be trusted," he bade Mary curtly.</p> 
<p>　　It was Garson who answered.</p> 
<p>　　"I know that you can be trusted," he said, "because I know youlo----" He checked himself with a shiver, and out of the darknesshis face showed white.</p> 
<p>　　"You must listen," Dick went on, facing again toward the girl,who was trembling before him, her eyes by turns searching hisexpression or downcast in unfamiliar confusion, which she herselfcould hardly understand.</p> 
<p>　　"Your safety depends on me," the young man warned. "Suppose Ishould call for help?"Garson stepped forward threateningly.</p> 
<p>　　"You would only call once," he said very gently, yet most grimly.</p> 
<p>　　His hand went to the noiseless weapon in his coat-pocket.</p> 
<p>　　But the young man's answer revealed the fact that he, too, wasdetermined to the utmost, that he understood perfectly thesituation.</p> 
<p>　　"Once would be quite enough," he said simply.</p> 
<p>　　Garson nodded in acceptance of the defeat. It may be, too, thatin some subtle fashion he admired this youth suddenly grownresolute, competent to control a dangerous event. There was eventhe possibility that some instinct of tenderness toward Maryherself made him desire that this opportunity should be given forwiping out the effects of misfortune which fate hitherto hadbrought into her life.</p> 
<p>　　"You win," Garson said, with a half-laugh. He turned to theother men and spoke a command.</p> 
<p>　　"You get over by the hall door, Red. And keep your ears openevery second. Give us the office if you hear anything. If we'rerushed, and have to make a quick get-away, see that Mary has thefirst chance. Get that, all of you?"As Chicago Red took up his appointed station, Garson turned toDick.</p> 
<p>　　"Make it quick, remember."He touched the other two and moved back to the wall by thefireplace, as far as possible from the husband and wife by thecouch.</p> 
<p>　　Dick spoke at once, with a hesitancy that betrayed the depth ofhis emotion.</p> 
<p>　　"Don't you care for me at all?" he asked wistfully.</p> 
<p>　　The girl's answer was uttered with nervous eagerness whichrevealed her own stress of fear.</p> 
<p>　　"No, no, no!" she exclaimed, rebelliously.</p> 
<p>　　Now, however, the young man had regained some measure ofreassurance.</p> 
<p>　　"I know you do, Mary," he asserted, confidently; "a little,anyway. Why, Mary," he went on reproachfully, "can't you seethat you're throwing away everything that makes life worth while?</p> 
<p>　　Don't you see that?"There was no word from the girl. Her breast was movingconvulsively. She held her face steadfastly averted from theface of her husband.</p> 
<p>　　"Why don't you answer me?" he insisted.</p> 
<p>　　Mary's reply came with all the coldness she could command.</p> 
<p>　　"That was not in the bargain," Mary said, indifferently.</p> 
<p>　　The man's voice grew tenderly winning, persuasive with thelonging of a lover, persuasive with the pity of the righteous forthe sinner.</p> 
<p>　　"Mary, Mary!" he cried. "You've got to change. Don't be so hard.</p> 
<p>　　Give the woman in you a chance."The girl's form became rigid as she fought for self-control. Theplea touched to the bottom of her heart, but she could not, wouldnot yield. Her words rushed forth with a bitterness that was thecover of her distress.</p> 
<p>　　"I am what I am," she said sharply. "I can't change. Keep yourpromise, now, and let's get out of this."Her assertion was disregarded as to the inability to change.</p> 
<p>　　"You can change," Dick went on impetuously. "Mary, haven't youever wanted the things that other women have, shelter, and care,and the big things of life, the things worth while? They're allready for you, now, Mary.... And what about me?" Reproach leapedin his tone. "After all, you've married me. Now it's up to youto give me my chance to make good. I've never amounted to much.</p> 
<p>　　I've never tried much. I shall, now, if you will have it so,Mary; if you'll help me. I will come out all right, I knowthat--so do you, Mary. Only, you must help me.""I help you!" The exclamation came from the girl in a note ofincredulous astonishment.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes," Dick said, simply. "I need you, and you need me. Comeaway with me.""No, no!" was the broken refusal. There was a great griefclutching at the soul of this woman who had brought vengeance toits full flower. She was gasping. "No, no! I married you, notbecause I loved you, but to repay your father the wrong he haddone me. I wouldn't let myself even think of you, and then--Irealized that I had spoiled your life.""No, not spoiled it, Mary! Blessed it! We must prove that yet.""Yes, spoiled it," the wife went on passionately. "If I hadunderstood, if I could have dreamed that I could ever care----Oh, Dick, I would never have married you for anything in theworld.""But now you do realize," the young man said quietly. "The thingis done. If we made a mistake, it is for us to bring happinessout of that error.""Oh, can't you see?" came the stricken lament. "I'm ajail-bird!""But you love me--you do love me, I know!" The young man spokewith joyous certainty, for some inflection of her voice had toldthe truth to his heart. Nothing else mattered. "But now, to comeback to this hole we're in here. Don't you understand, at last,that you can't beat the law? If you're caught here to-night,where would you get off--caught here with a gang of burglars?</p> 
<p>　　Tell me, dear, why did you do it? Why didn't you protectyourself? Why didn't you go to Chicago as you planned?""What?" There was a new quality in Mary's voice. A sudden throbof shock masked in the surface indifference of intonation.</p> 
<p>　　Dick repeated his question, unobservant of its first effect.</p> 
<p>　　"Why didn't you go to Chicago as you had planned?""Planned? With whom?" The interrogation came with an abruptforce that cried of new suspicions.</p> 
<p>　　"Why, with Burke." The young man tried to be patient over herdensity in this time of crisis.</p> 
<p>　　"Who told you that I had arranged any such thing?" Mary asked.</p> 
<p>　　Now the tenseness in her manner got the husband's attention, andhe replied with a sudden gravity, apprehensive of he knew notwhat.</p> 
<p>　　"Burke himself did.""When?" Mary was standing rigid now, and the rare color flamedin her cheeks. Her eyes were blazing.</p> 
<p>　　"Less than an hour ago." He had caught the contagion of her moodand vague alarm swept him.</p> 
<p>　　"Where?" came the next question, still with that vitalinsistence.</p> 
<p>　　"In this room.""Burke was here?" Mary's voice was suddenly cold, verydangerous. "What was he doing here?""Talking to my father."The seemingly simple answer appeared the last straw to the girl'sburden of frenzied suspicion. Her voice cut fiercely into thequiet of the room, imperious, savage.</p> 
<p>　　"Joe, turn on that light! I want to see the face of every man inthis room."Something fatally significant in her voice set Garson a-leap tothe switch, and, in the same second, the blaze of the chandelierflamed brilliantly over all. The others stood motionless,blinking in the sudden radiance--all save Griggs, who movedstealthily in that same moment, a little nearer the door into thepassage, which was nearest to him.</p> 
<p>　　But Mary's next words came wholly as a surprise, seeminglytotally irrelevant to this instant of crisis. Yet they ranga-throb with an hysterical anxiety.</p> 
<p>　　"Dick," she cried, "what are those tapestries worth?" With thequestion, she pointed toward the draperies that shrouded thegreat octagonal window.</p> 
<p>　　The young man was plainly astonished, disconcerted as well by theobtrusion of a sordid detail into the tragedy of the time.</p> 
<p>　　"Why in the world do you----?" he began, impatiently.</p> 
<p>　　Mary stamped her foot angrily in protest against the delay.</p> 
<p>　　"Tell me--quick!" she commanded. The authority in her voice andmanner was not to be gainsaid.</p> 
<p>　　Dick yielded sullenly.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, two or three hundred dollars, I suppose," he answered.</p> 
<p>　　"Why?""Never mind that!" Mary exclaimed, violently. And now the girl'svoice came stinging like a whiplash. In Garson's face, too, wasgrowing fury, for in an instant of illumination he guessedsomething of the truth. Mary's next question confirmed his ragingsuspicion.</p> 
<p>　　"How long have you had them, Dick?"By now, the young man himself sensed the fact that somethingmysteriously baneful lay behind the frantic questioning on thisseemingly trivial theme.</p> 
<p>　　"Ever since I can remember," he replied, promptly.</p> 
<p>　　Mary's voice came then with an intonation that broughtenlightenment not only to Garson's shrewd perceptions, but alsoto the heavier intelligences of Dacey and of Chicago Red.</p> 
<p>　　"And they're not famous masterpieces which your father boughtrecently, from some dealer who smuggled them into this country?"So simple were the words of her inquiry, but under them beatsomething evil, deadly.</p> 
<p>　　The young man laughed contemptuously.</p> 
<p>　　"I should say not!" he declared indignantly, for he resented theimplication against his father's honesty.</p> 
<p>　　"It's a trick! Burke's done it!" Mary's words came with accusingvehemence.</p> 
<p>　　There was another single step made by Griggs toward the door intothe passage.</p> 
<p>　　Mary's eye caught the movement, and her lips soundlessly formedthe name:</p> 
<p>　　"Griggs!"The man strove to carry off the situation, though he knew wellthat he stood in mortal peril. He came a little toward the girlwho had accused him of treachery. He was very dapper in hisevening clothes, with his rather handsome, well-groomed face setin lines of innocence.</p> 
<p>　　"He's lying to you!" he cried forcibly, with a scornful gesturetoward Dick Gilder. "I tell you, those tapestries are worth amillion cold."Mary's answer was virulent in its sudden burst of hate. Foronce, the music of her voice was lost in a discordant cry ofdetestation.</p> 
<p>　　"You stool-pigeon! You did this for Burke!"Griggs sought still to maintain his air of innocence, and hestrove well, since he knew that he fought for his life againstthose whom he had outraged. As he spoke again, his tones weretremulous with sincerity--perhaps that tremulousness was bornchiefly of fear, yet to the ear his words came stoutly enough fortruth:</p> 
<p>　　"I swear I didn't! I swear it!"Mary regarded the protesting man with abhorrence. The perjuredwretch shrank before the loathing in her eyes.</p> 
<p>　　"You came to me yesterday," she said, with more of restraint inher voice now, but still with inexorable rancor. "You came to meto explain this plan. And you came from him--from Burke!""I swear I was on the level. I was tipped off to the story by apal," Griggs declared, but at last the assurance was gone out ofhis voice. He felt the hostility of those about him.</p> 
<p>　　Garson broke in ferociously.</p> 
<p>　　"It's a frame-up!" he said. His tones came in a deadened roar ofwrath.</p> 
<p>　　On the instant, aware that further subterfuge could be of noavail, Griggs swaggered defiance.</p> 
<p>　　"And what if it is true?" he drawled, with a resumption of hisaristocratic manner, while his eyes swept the group balefully.</p> 
<p>　　He plucked the police whistle from his waistcoat-pocket, andraised it to his lips.</p> 
<p>　　He moved too slowly. In the same moment of his action, Garsonhad pulled the pistol from his pocket, had pressed the trigger.</p> 
<p>　　There came no spurt of flame. There was no sound--save perhaps afaint clicking noise. But the man with the whistle at his lipssuddenly ceased movement, stood absolutely still for the space ofa breath. Then, he trembled horribly, and in the next instantcrashed to the floor, where he lay rigid, dead.</p> 
<p>　　"Damn you--I've got you!" Garson sneered through clenched teeth.</p> 
<p>　　His eyes were like balls of fire. There was a frightful grin oftriumph twisting his mouth in this minute of punishment.</p> 
<p>　　In the first second of the tragedy, Dick had not understood.</p> 
<p>　　Indeed, he was still dazed by the suddenness of it all. But thefalling of Griggs before the leveled weapon of the other man,there to lie in that ghastly immobility, made him to understand.</p> 
<p>　　He leaped toward Garson--would have wrenched the pistol from theother's grasp. In the struggle, it fell to the floor.</p> 
<p>　　Before either could pick it up, there came an interruption. Evenin the stress of this scene, Chicago Red had never relaxed hisprofessional caution. A slight noise had caught his ear, he hadstooped, listening. Now, he straightened, and called his warning.</p> 
<p>　　"Somebody's opening the front door!"Garson forgot his weapon in this new alarm. He sprang to theoctagonal window, even as Dick took possession of the pistol.</p> 
<p>　　"The street's empty! We must jump for it!" His hate was forgottennow in an emotion still deeper, and he turned to Mary. His facewas all gentleness again, where just before it had been evilincarnate, aflame with the lust to destroy. "Come on, Mary," hecried.</p> 
<p>　　Already Chicago Red had snapped off the lights of the chandelier,had sprung to the window, thrown open a panel of it, and hadvanished into the night, with Dacey at his heels. As Garsonwould have called out to the girl again in mad anxiety for haste,he was interrupted by Dick:</p> 
<p>　　"She couldn't make it, Garson," he declared coolly andresolutely. "You go. It'll be all right, you know. I'll takecare of her!""If she's caught----!" There was an indescribable menace in theforger's half-uttered threat.</p> 
<p>　　"She won't be." The quality of sincerity in Dick's voice wasmore convincing than any vow might have been.</p> 
<p>　　"If she is, I'll get you, that's all," Garson said gravely, asone stating a simple fact that could not be disputed.</p> 
<p>　　Then he glanced down at the body of the man whom he had done todeath.</p> 
<p>　　"And you can tell that to Burke!" he said viciously to the dead.</p> 
<p>　　"You damned squealer!" There was a supremely malevolent contentin his sneer.</p>
