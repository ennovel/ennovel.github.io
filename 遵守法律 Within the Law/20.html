He had hoped through thisplot to vindicate his authority, so sadly flaunted by Garson and Mary Turner. Instead of this much-to-be-desired resultfrom his scheming, the outcome had been nothing less than disastrous. The one certain fact was that his most valuableally in his warfare against the criminals of the city had been done to death. Some one had murdered Griggs, the stoolpigeon.</p> 
<p>　　Where Burke had meant to serve a man of high influence, Edward Gilder, by railroading the bride of themagnate's son to prison, he had succeeded only in making the trouble of that merchant prince vastly worse in theending of the affair by arresting the son for the capital crime of murder. The situation was, in very truth, intolerable.</p> 
<p>　　More than ever, Burke grew hot with intent to overcome the woman who had so persistently outraged his authority byher ingenious devices against the law. Anyhow, the murder of Griggs could not go unpunished. The slayer's identitymust be determined, and thereafter the due penalty of the law inflicted, whoever the guilty person might prove to be.</p> 
<p>　　To the discovery of this identity, the Inspector was at the present moment devoting himself by adroit questioning ofDacey and Chicago Red, who had been arrested in one of their accustomed haunts by his men a short time before.</p> 
<p>　　The policeman on duty at the door was the only other person in the room, and in consequence Burke permitted himself,quite unashamed, to employ those methods of persuasion which have risen to a high degree of admiration in policecircles.</p> 
<p>　　"Come across now!" he admonished. His voice rolled forth like that of a bull of Bashan. He was on his feet, facingthe two thieves. His head was thrust forward menacingly, and his eyes were savage. The two men shrank before him--both in natural fear, and, too, in a furtive policy of their own. This was no occasion for them to assert a personalpride against the man who had them in his toils.</p> 
<p>　　"I don't know nothin'!" Chicago Red's voice was between a snarl and a whine. "Ain't I been telling you that for overan hour?"Burke vouchsafed no answer in speech, but with a nimbleness surprising in one of his bulk, gave Dacey, who chancedto be the nearer of the two, a shove that sent the fellow staggering half-way across the room under its impetus.</p> 
<p>　　With this by way of appreciable introduction to his seriousness of purpose, Burke put a question:</p> 
<p>　　"Dacey, how long have you been out?"The answer came in a sibilant whisper of dread.</p> 
<p>　　"A week."Burke pushed the implication brutally.</p> 
<p>　　"Want to go back for another stretch?" The Inspector's voice was freighted with suggestions of disasters to come,which were well understood by the cringing wretch before him.</p> 
<p>　　The thief shuddered, and his face, already pallid from the prison lack of sunlight like some noxious growth of a cellar,became livid. His words came in a muffled moan of fear.</p> 
<p>　　"God, no!"Burke left a little interval of silence then in which the thieves might tremble over the prospect suggested by his words,but always he maintained his steady, relentless glare on the cowed creatures. It was a familiar warfare with him. Yet,in this instance, he was destined to failure, for the men were of a type different from that of English Eddie, who waslying dead as the meet reward for treachery to his fellows.... When, at last, his question issued from the close-shut lips,it came like the crack of a gun.</p> 
<p>　　"Who shot Griggs?"The reply was a chorus from the two:</p> 
<p>　　"I don't know--honest, I don't!"In his eagerness, Chicago Red moved toward his questioner--unwisely.</p> 
<p>　　"Honest to Gawd, I don't know nothin' about it!"The Inspector's fist shot out toward Chicago Red's jaw. The impact was enough. The thief went to his knees under theblow.</p> 
<p>　　"Now, get up--and talk!" Burke's voice came with unrepentant noisiness against the stricken man.</p> 
<p>　　Cringingly, Chicago Red, who so gloried in his strength, yet was now altogether humble in this precarious case,obeyed as far as the getting to his feet was concerned.... It never occurred to him even that he should carry hisobedience to the point of "squealing on a pal!" Had the circumstances been different, he might have refused to acceptthe Inspector's blow with such meekness, since above all things he loved a bit of bodily strife with some one near hisown strength, and the Inspector was of a sort to offer him a battle worth while.</p> 
<p>　　So, now, while he got slowly to his feet, he took care to keep at a respectful distance from the official, though his bighands fairly ached to double into fists for blows with this man who had so maltreated him.</p> 
<p>　　His own self-respect, of its peculiar sort, was saved by the interference of Cassidy, who entered the Inspector's officeto announce the arrival of the District Attorney.</p> 
<p>　　"Send 'im in," Burke directed at once. He made a gesture toward the doorman, and added: "Take 'em back!"A grin of evil humor writhed the lips of the police official, and he added to the attentive doorman a word of directionthat might well be interpreted by the malevolent expression on his face.</p> 
<p>　　"Don't be rough with 'em, Dan," he said. For once, his dominating voice was reduced to something approachingsoftness, in his sardonic appreciation of his own humor in the conception of what these two men, who had ventured toresist his importunities, might receive at the hands of his faithful satellites.... The doorman grinned appreciatively, andherded his victims from the place. And the two went shamblingly in sure knowledge of the things that were in store.</p> 
<p>　　Yet, without thought of treachery. They would not "squeal"! All they would tell of the death of Eddie Griggs wouldbe: "He got what was coming to him!"The Inspector dropped into his swivel chair at the desk whilst he awaited the arrival of Demarest, the District Attorney.</p> 
<p>　　The greetings between the two were cordial when at last the public prosecutor made his appearance.</p> 
<p>　　"I came as soon as I got your message," the District Attorney said, as he seated himself in a chair by the desk. "AndI've sent word to Mr. Gilder.... Now, then, Burke, let's have this thing quickly."The Inspector's explanation was concise:</p> 
<p>　　"Joe Garson, Chicago Red, and Dacey, along with Griggs, broke into Edward Gilder's house, last night! I knew thetrick was going to be pulled off, and so I planted Cassidy and a couple of other men just outside the room where thehaul was to be made. Then, I went away, and after something like half an hour I came back to make the arrestsmyself." A look of intense disgust spread itself over the Inspector's massive face. "Well," he concluded sheepishly,"when I broke into the room I found young Gilder along with that Turner woman he married, and they were justtalking together.""No trace of the others?" Demarest questioned crisply.</p> 
<p>　　At the inquiry, Burke's face crimsoned angrily, then again set in grim lines.</p> 
<p>　　"I found Griggs lying on the floor--dead!" Once again the disgust showed in his expression. "The Turner woman saysyoung Gilder shot Griggs because he broke into the house. Ain't that the limit?""What does the boy say?" the District Attorney demanded.</p> 
<p>　　Burke shook his head dispiritedly.</p> 
<p>　　"Nothing," he answered. "She told him not to talk, and so, of course, he won't, he's such a fool over her.""And what does she say?" Demarest asked. He found himself rather amused by the exceeding chagrin of theInspector over this affair.</p> 
<p>　　Burke's voice grew savage as he snapped a reply.</p> 
<p>　　"Refuses to talk till she sees a lawyer. But a touch of cheerfulness appeared in his tones as he proceeded. "We've gotChicago Red and Dacey, and we'll have Garson before the day's over. And, oh, yes, they've picked up a young girl atthe Turner woman's place. And we've got one real clue--for once!" The speaker's expression was suddenly triumphant.</p> 
<p>　　He opened a drawer of the desk, and took out Garson's pistol, to which the silencer was still attached.</p> 
<p>　　"You never saw a gun like that before, eh?" he exclaimed.</p> 
<p>　　Demarest admitted the fact after a curious examination.</p> 
<p>　　"I'll bet you never did!" Burke cried, with satisfaction. "That thing on the end is a Maxim silencer. There are thousandsof them in use on rifles, but they've never been able to use them on revolvers before. This is a specially made gun," hewent on admiringly, as he took it back and slipped it into a pocket of his coat. "That thing is absolutely noiseless. I'vetried it. Well, you see, it'll be an easy thing--easiest thing in the world!--to trace that silencer attachment. Cassidy'sworking on that end of the thing now."For a few minutes longer, the two men discussed the details of the crime, theorizing over the baffling event. Then,presently, Cassidy entered the office, and made report of his investigations concerning the pistol with the silencerattachment.</p> 
<p>　　"I got the factory at Hartford on the wire," he explained, "and they gave me Mr. Maxim himself, the inventor of thesilencer. He said this was surely a special gun, which was made for the use of Henry Sylvester, one of the professorsat Yale. He wanted it for demonstration purposes. Mr. Maxim said the things have never been put on the market, andthat they never will be.""For humane reasons," Demarest commented, nodding approbation.</p> 
<p>　　"Good thing, too!" Burke conceded. "They'd make murder too devilish easy, and it's easy enough now.... Well,Cassidy?""I got hold of this man, Sylvester," Cassidy went on. "I had him on the 'phone, too. He says that his house was robbedabout eight weeks ago, and among other things the silencer was stolen." Cassidy paused, and chuckled drily. "Headds the startling information that the New Haven police have not been able to recover any of the stolen property.</p> 
<p>　　Them rube cops are immense!"Demarest smiled slyly, as the detective, at a nod from his superior, went toward the door.</p> 
<p>　　"No," he said, maliciously; "only the New York police recover stolen goods.""Good-night!" quoth Cassidy, turning at the door, in admission of his discomfiture over the thrust, while Burke himselfgrinned wryly in appreciation of the gibe.</p> 
<p>　　Demarest grew grave again, as he put the question that was troubling him most.</p> 
<p>　　"Is there any chance that young Gilder did shoot Griggs?""You can search me!" the Inspector answered, disconsolately. "My men were just outside the door of the room whereEddie Griggs was shot to death, and none of 'em heard a sound. It's that infernal silencer thing. Of course, I know thatall the gang was in the house.""But tell me just how you know that fact," Demarest objected very crisply. "Did you see them go in?""No, I didn't," the Inspector admitted, tartly. "But Griggs----"Demarest permitted himself a sneer born of legal knowledge.</p> 
<p>　　"Griggs is dead, Burke. You're up against it. You can't prove that Garson, or Chicago Red, or Dacey, ever enteredthat house."The Inspector scowled over this positive statement.</p> 
<p>　　"But Griggs said they were going to," he argued.</p> 
<p>　　"I know," Demarest agreed, with an exasperating air of shrewdness; "but Griggs is dead. You see, Burke, you couldn'tin a trial even repeat what he told you. It's not permissible evidence.""Oh, the law!" the Inspector snorted, with much choler. "Well, then," he went on belligerently, "I'll charge youngGilder with murder, and call the Turner woman as a witness."The District Attorney laughed aloud over this project.</p> 
<p>　　"You can't question her on the witness-stand," he explained patronizingly to the badgered police official. "The lawdoesn't allow you to make a wife testify against her husband. And, what's more, you can't arrest her, and then forceher to go into the witness-stand, either. No, Burke," he concluded emphatically, "your only chance of getting themurderer of Griggs is by a confession.""Then, I'll charge them both with the murder," the Inspector growled vindictively. "And, by God, they'll both go totrial unless somebody comes through." He brought his huge fist down on the desk with violence, and his voice wasforbidding. "If it's my last act on earth," he declared, "I'm going to get the man who shot Eddie Griggs."Demarest was seriously disturbed by the situation that had developed. He was under great personal obligations toEdward Gilder, whose influence in fact had been the prime cause of his success in attaining to the important officialposition he now held, and he would have gone far to serve the magnate in any difficulty that might arise. He had beenperfectly willing to employ all the resources of his office to relieve the son from the entanglement with a woman ofunsavory notoriety. Now, thanks to the miscarried plotting of Burke to the like end, what before had been merely avicious state of affairs was become one of the utmost dreadfulness. The worst of crimes had been committed in thehouse of Edward Gilder himself, and his son acknowledged himself as the murderer. The District Attorney felt agenuine sorrow in thinking of the anguish this event must have brought on the father. He had, as well, sympathyenough for the son. His acquaintance with the young man convinced him that the boy had not done the deed of bloodyviolence. In that fact was a mingling of comfort and of anxiety. It had been better, doubtless, if indeed Dick had shotGriggs, had indicted a just penalty on a housebreaker. But the District Attorney was not inclined to credit theconfession. Burke's account of the plot in which the stool-pigeon had been the agent offered too many complications.</p> 
<p>　　Altogether, the aspect of the case served to indicate that Dick could not have been the slayer.... Demarest shook hishead dejectedly.</p> 
<p>　　"Burke," he said, "I want the boy to go free. I don't believe for a minute that Dick Gilder ever killed this pet stoolpigeonof yours. And, so, you must understand this: I want him to go free, of course."Burke frowned refusal at this suggestion. Here was a matter in which his rights must not be invaded. He, too, wouldhave gone far to serve a man of Edward Gilder's standing, but in this instance his professional pride was in revolt. Hehad been defied, trapped, made a victim of the gang who had killed his most valued informer.</p> 
<p>　　"The youngster'll go free when he tells what he knows," he said angrily, "and not a minute before." His expressionlightened a little. "Perhaps the old gentleman can make him talk. I can't. He's under that woman's thumb, of course,and she's told him he mustn't say a word. So, he don't." A grin of half-embarrassed appreciation moved the heavyjaws as he glanced at the District Attorney. "You see," he explained, "I can't make him talk, but I might ifcircumstances were different. On account of his being the old man's son, I'm a little cramped in my style."It was, in truth, one thing to browbeat and assault a convict like Dacey or Chicago Red, but quite another to employthe like violence against a youth of Dick Gilder's position in the world. Demarest understood perfectly, but he wasinclined to be sceptical over the Inspector's theory that Dick possessed actual cognizance as to the killing of Griggs.</p> 
<p>　　"You think that young Gilder really knows?" he questioned, doubtfully.</p> 
<p>　　"I don't think anything--yet!" Burke retorted. "All I know is this: Eddie Griggs, the most valuable crook that everworked for me, has been murdered." The official's voice was charged with threatening as he went on. "And some one,man or woman, is going to pay for it!""Woman?" Demarest repeated, in some astonishment.</p> 
<p>　　Burke's voice came merciless.</p> 
<p>　　"I mean, Mary Turner," he said slowly.</p> 
<p>　　Demarest was shocked.</p> 
<p>　　"But, Burke," he expostulated, "she's not that sort." The Inspector sneered openly.</p> 
<p>　　"How do you know she ain't?" he demanded. "Well, anyhow, she's made a monkey out of the Police Department,and, first, last, and all the time, I'm a copper. . . And that reminds me," he went on with a resumption of his usual curtbluntness, "I want you to wait for Mr. Gilder outside, while I get busy with the girl they've brought down from MaryTurner's flat."</p>
