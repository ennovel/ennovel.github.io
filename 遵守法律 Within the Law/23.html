Foiled in his efforts thus far by theopposition of Mary, he now gave himself over to careful thoughtas to a means of procedure that might offer the bestpossibilities of success. His beetling brows were drawn in afrown of perplexity for a full quarter of an hour, while herested motionless in his chair, an unlighted cigar between hislips. Then, at last, his face cleared; a grin of satisfactiontwisted his heavy mouth, and he smote the desk joyously.</p> 
<p>　　"It's a cinch it'll get 'im!" he rumbled, in glee.</p> 
<p>　　He pressed the button-call, and ordered the doorman to send inCassidy. When the detective appeared a minute later, he wentdirectly to his subject with a straightforward energy usual tohim in his work.</p> 
<p>　　"Does Garson know we've arrested the Turner girl and youngGilder?" And, when he had been answered in the negative: "Orthat we've got Chicago Red and Dacey here?""No," Cassidy replied. "He hasn't been spoken to since we madethe collar.... He seems worried," the detective volunteered.</p> 
<p>　　Burke's broad jowls shook from the force with which he snappedhis jaws together.</p> 
<p>　　"He'll be more worried before I get through with him!" hegrowled. He regarded Cassidy speculatively. "Do you remember theThird Degree Inspector Burns worked on McGloin? Well," he wenton, as the detective nodded assent, "that's what I'm going to doto Garson. He's got imagination, that crook! The things he don'tknow about are the things he's afraid of. After he gets in here,I want you to take his pals one after the other, and lock them upin the cells there in the corridor. The shades on the corridorwindows here will be up, and Garson will see them taken in. Thefact of their being there will set his imagination to workingovertime, all right."Burke reflected for a moment, and then issued the finaldirections for the execution of his latest plot.</p> 
<p>　　"When you get the buzzer from me, you have young Gilder and theTurner woman sent in. Then, after a while, you'll get anotherbuzzer. When you hear that, come right in here, and tell me thatthe gang has squealed. I'll do the rest. Bring Garson here injust five minutes.... Tell Dan to come in."As the detective went out, the doorman promptly entered, andthereat Burke proceeded with the further instructions necessaryto the carrying out of his scheme.</p> 
<p>　　"Take the chairs out of the office, Dan," he directed, "exceptmine and one other--that one!" He indicated a chair standing alittle way from one end of his desk. "Now, have all the shadesup." He chuckled as he added: "That Turner woman saved you thetrouble with one."As the doorman went out after having fulfilled these commands,the Inspector lighted the cigar which he had retained still inhis mouth, and then seated himself in the chair that was setpartly facing the windows opening on the corridor. He smiledwith anticipatory triumph as he made sure that the whole lengthof the corridor with the barred doors of the cells was plainlyvisible to one sitting thus. With a final glance about to makecertain that all was in readiness, he returned to his chair, and,when the door opened, he was, to all appearances, busily engagedin writing.</p> 
<p>　　"Here's Garson, Chief," Cassidy announced.</p> 
<p>　　"Hello, Joe!" Burke exclaimed, with a seeming of carelessfriendliness, as the detective went out, and Garson stoodmotionless just within the door.</p> 
<p>　　"Sit down, a minute, won't you?" the Inspector continued,affably. He did not look up from his writing as he spoke.</p> 
<p>　　Garson's usually strong face was showing weak with fear. Hischin, which was commonly very firm, moved a little from uneasytwitchings of his lips. His clear eyes were slightly clouded toa look of apprehension, as they roved the room furtively. Hemade no answer to the Inspector's greeting for a few moments, butremained standing without movement, poised alertly as if sensingsome concealed peril. Finally, however, his anxiety foundexpression in words. His tone was pregnant with alarm, though hestrove to make it merely complaining.</p> 
<p>　　"Say, what am I arrested for?" he protested. "I ain't doneanything."Even now, Burke did not look up, and his pen continued to hurryover the paper.</p> 
<p>　　"Who told you you were arrested?" he remarked, cheerfully, inhis blandest voice.</p> 
<p>　　Garson uttered an ejaculation of disgust.</p> 
<p>　　"I don't have to be told," he retorted, huffily. "I'm no collegepresident, but, when a cop grabs me and brings me down here, I'vegot sense enough to know I'm pinched."The Inspector did not interrupt his work, but answered with theutmost good nature.</p> 
<p>　　"Is that what they did to you, Joe? I'll have to speak toCassidy about that. Now, just you sit down, Joe, won't you? Iwant to have a little talk with you. I'll be through here in asecond." He went on with the writing.</p> 
<p>　　Garson moved forward slightly, to the single chair near the endof the desk, and there seated himself mechanically. His face thuswas turned toward the windows that gave on the corridor, and hiseyes grew yet more clouded as they rested on the grim doors ofthe cells. He writhed in his chair, and his gaze jumped from thecells to the impassive figure of the man at the desk. Now, theforger's nervousness increased momently it swept beyond hiscontrol. Of a sudden, he sprang up, and stepped close to theInspector.</p> 
<p>　　"Say," he said, in a husky voice, "I'd like--I'd like to have alawyer.""What's the matter with you, Joe?" the Inspector returned,always with that imperturbable air, and without raising his headfrom the work that so engrossed his attention. "You know, you'renot arrested, Joe. Maybe, you never will be. Now, for the loveof Mike, keep still, and let me finish this letter."Slowly, very hesitatingly, Garson went back to the chair, andsank down on it in a limp attitude of dejection wholly unlike hiscustomary postures of strength. Again, his fear-fascinated eyeswent to the row of cells that stood silently menacing on theother side of the corridor beyond the windows. His face wastinged with gray. A physical sickness was creeping stealthily onhim, as his thoughts held insistently to the catastrophe thatthreatened. His intelligence was too keen to permit a beliefthat Burke's manner of almost fulsome kindliness hid nothingominous--ominous with a hint of death for him in return for thedeath he had wrought.</p> 
<p>　　Then, terror crystallized. His eyes were caught by a figure, thefigure of Cassidy, advancing there in the corridor. And with thedetective went a man whose gait was slinking, craven. Acell-door swung open, the prisoner stepped within, the doorclanged to, the bolts shot into their sockets noisily.</p> 
<p>　　Garson sat huddled, stricken--for he had recognized the victimthrust into the cell before his eyes.... It was Dacey, one of hisown cronies in crime--Dacey, who, the night before, had seen himkill Eddie Griggs. There was something concretely sinister toGarson in this fact of Dacey's presence there in the cell.</p> 
<p>　　Of a sudden, the forger cried out raucously:</p> 
<p>　　"Say, Inspector, if you've got anything on me, I--I would----"The cry dropped into unintelligible mumblings.</p> 
<p>　　Burke retained his manner of serene indifference to the other'sagitation. Still, his pen hurried over the paper; and he did nottrouble to look up as he expostulated, half-banteringly.</p> 
<p>　　"Now, now! What's the matter with you, Joe? I told you that Iwanted to ask you a few questions. That's all."Garson leaped to his feet again resolutely, then faltered, andultimately fell back into the chair with a groan, as theInspector went on speaking.</p> 
<p>　　"Now, Joe, sit down, and keep still, I tell you, and let me getthrough with this job. It won't take me more than a minutemore."But, after a moment, Garson's emotion forced hint to anotherappeal.</p> 
<p>　　"Say, Inspector----" he began.</p> 
<p>　　Then, abruptly, he was silent, his mouth still open to utter thewords that were now held back by horror. Again, he saw thedetective walking forward, out there in the corridor. And withhim, as before, was a second figure, which advanced slinkingly.</p> 
<p>　　Garson leaned forward in his chair, his head thrust out, watchingin rigid suspense. Again, even as before, the door swung wide,the prisoner slipped within, the door clanged shut, the boltsclattered noisily into their sockets.</p> 
<p>　　And, in the watcher, terror grew--for he had seen the face ofChicago Red, another of his pals, another who had seen him killGriggs. For a time that seemed to him long ages of misery,Garson sat staring dazedly at the closed doors of the tier ofcells. The peril about him was growing--growing, and it was adeadly peril! At last, he licked his dry lips, and his voicebroke in a throaty whisper.</p> 
<p>　　"Say, Inspector, if you've got anything against me, why----""Who said there was anything against you, Joe?" Burke rejoined,in a voice that was genially chiding. "What's the matter with youto-day, Joe? You seem nervous." Still, the official kept onwith his writing.</p> 
<p>　　"No, I ain't nervous," Garson cried, with a feverish effort toappear calm. "Why, what makes you think that? But this ain'texactly the place you'd pick out as a pleasant one to spend themorning." He was silent for a little, trying with all hisstrength to regain his self-control, but with small success.</p> 
<p>　　"Could I ask you a question?" he demanded finally, with morefirmness in his voice.</p> 
<p>　　"What is it?" Burke said.</p> 
<p>　　Garson cleared his throat with difficulty, and his voice wasthick.</p> 
<p>　　"I was just going to say--" he began. Then, he hesitated, andwas silent, at a loss.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, what is it, Joe?" the Inspector prompted.</p> 
<p>　　"I was going to say--that is--well, if it's anything about MaryTurner, I don't know a thing--not a thing!"It was the thought of possible peril to her that now, in aninstant, had caused him to forget his own mortal danger. Where,before, he had been shuddering over thoughts of the death-housecell that might be awaiting him, he now had concern only for thesafety of the woman he cherished. And there was a great grief inhis soul; for it was borne in on him that his own folly, indisobedience to her command, had led up to the murder ofGriggs--and to all that might come of the crime. How could heever make amends to her? At least, he could be brave here, forher sake, if not for his own.</p> 
<p>　　Burke believed that his opportunity was come.</p> 
<p>　　"What made you think I wanted to know anything about her?" hequestioned.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, I can't exactly say," Garson replied carelessly, in anattempt to dissimulate his agitation. "You were up to the house,you know. Don't you see?""I did want to see her, that's a fact," Burke admitted. He kepton with his writing, his head bent low. "But she wasn't at herflat. I guess she must have taken my advice, and skipped out.</p> 
<p>　　Clever girl, that!"Garson contrived to present an aspect of comparativeindifference.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes," he agreed. "I was thinking of going West, myself," heventured.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, were you?" Burke exclaimed; and, now, there was a new notein his voice. His hand slipped into the pocket where was thepistol, and clutched it. He stared at Garson fiercely, and spokewith a rush of the words:</p> 
<p>　　"Why did you kill Eddie Griggs?""I didn't kill him!" The reply was quick enough, but it cameweakly. Again, Garson was forced to wet his lips with a drytongue, and to swallow painfully. "I tell you, I didn't killhim!" he repeated at last, with more force.</p> 
<p>　　Burke sneered his disbelief.</p> 
<p>　　"You killed him last night--with this!" he cried, viciously. Onthe instant, the pistol leaped into view, pointed straight atGarson. "Why?" the Inspector shouted. "Come on, now! Why?""I didn't, I tell you!" Garson was growing stronger, since atlast the crisis was upon him. He got to his feet with litheswiftness of movement, and sprang close to the desk. He bent hishead forward challengingly, to meet the glare of his accuser'seyes. There was no flinching in his own steely stare. Hisnerves had ceased their jangling under the tautening ofnecessity.</p> 
<p>　　"You did!" Burke vociferated. He put his whole will into theassertion of guilt, to batter down the man's resistance. "Youdid, I tell you! You did!"Garson leaned still further forward, until his face was almostlevel with the Inspector's. His eyes were unclouded now, wereblazing. His voice came resonant in its denial. The entire poseof him was intrepid, dauntless.</p> 
<p>　　"And I tell you, I didn't!"There passed many seconds, while the two men battled in silence,will warring against will. ... In the end, it was the murdererwho triumphed.</p> 
<p>　　Suddenly, Burke dropped the pistol into his pocket, and lolledback in his chair. His gaze fell away from the man confrontinghim. In the same instant, the rigidity of Garson's form relaxed,and he straightened slowly. A tide of secret joy swept throughhim, as he realized his victory. But his outward expressionremained unchanged.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, well," Burke exclaimed amiably, "I didn't really think youdid, but I wasn't sure, so I had to take a chance. Youunderstand, don't you, Joe?""Sure, I understand," Garson replied, with an amiability equal tothe Inspector's own.</p> 
<p>　　Burke's manner continued very amicable as he went on speaking.</p> 
<p>　　"You see, Joe, anyhow, we've got the right party safe enough.</p> 
<p>　　You can bet on that!"Garson resisted the lure.</p> 
<p>　　"If you don't want me----" he began suggestively; and he turnedtoward the door to the outer hall. "Why, if you don't want me,I'll--get along.""Oh, what's the hurry, Joe?" Burke retorted, with the effect ofstopping the other short. He pressed the buzzer as the agreedsignal to Cassidy. "Where did you say Mary Turner was lastnight?"At the question, all Garson's fears for the woman rushed back onhim with appalling force. Of what avail his safety, if she werestill in peril?</p> 
<p>　　"I don't know where she was," he exclaimed, doubtfully. Herealized his blunder even as the words left his lips, and soughtto correct it as best he might. "Why, yes, I do, too," he wenton, as if assailed by sudden memory. "I dropped into her placekind of late, and they said she'd gone to bed--headache, Iguess.... Yes, she was home, of course. She didn't go out of thehouse, all night." His insistence on the point was of itselfsuspicious, but eagerness to protect her stultified his wits.</p> 
<p>　　Burke sat grim and silent, offering no comment on the lie.</p> 
<p>　　"Know anything about young Gilder?" he demanded. "Happen to knowwhere he is now?" He arose and came around the desk, so that hestood close to Garson, at whom he glowered.</p> 
<p>　　"Not a thing!" was the earnest answer. But the speaker's fearrose swiftly, for the linking of these names wassignificant--frightfully significant!</p> 
<p>　　The inner door opened, and Mary Turner entered the office.</p> 
<p>　　Garson with difficulty suppressed the cry of distress that roseto his lips. For a few moments, the silence was unbroken. Then,presently, Burke, by a gesture, directed the girl to advancetoward the center of the room. As she obeyed, he himself went alittle toward the door, and, when it opened again, and DickGilder appeared, he interposed to check the young man's rushforward as his gaze fell on his bride, who stood regarding himwith sad eyes.</p> 
<p>　　Garson stared mutely at the burly man in uniform who held theirdestinies in the hollow of a hand. His lips parted as if he wereabout to speak. Then, he bade defiance to the impulse. Hedeemed it safer for all that he should say nothing--now!... Andit is very easy to say a word too many. And that one may be aword never to be unsaid--or gainsaid.</p> 
<p>　　Then, while still that curious, dynamic silence endured, Cassidycame briskly into the office. By some magic of duty, he hadcontrived to give his usually hebetudinous features an expressionof enthusiasm.</p> 
<p>　　"Say, Chief," the detective said rapidly, "they've squealed!"Burke regarded his aide with an air intolerably triumphant. Hisvoice came smug:</p> 
<p>　　"Squealed, eh?" His glance ran over Garson for a second, thenmade its inquisition of Mary and of Dick Gilder. He did not givea look to Cassidy as he put his question. "Do they tell the samestory?" And then, when the detective had answered in theaffirmative, he went on speaking in tones ponderous withself-complacency; and, now, his eyes held sharply, craftily, onthe woman.</p> 
<p>　　"I was right then, after all--right, all the time! Good enough!"Of a sudden, his voice boomed somberly. "Mary Turner, I want youfor the murder of----"Garson's rush halted the sentence. He had leaped forward. Hisface was rigid. He broke on the Inspector's words with a gestureof fury. His voice came in a hiss:</p> 
<p>　　"That's a damned lie!... I did it!"</p>
