<p>　　That volatile young person, little troubled as she was bysensitiveness, guessed the fact that just now further discussionof the event would be distasteful to Mary, and so she betookherself discreetly to a cigarette and the illustrations of apopular magazine devoted to the stage. As for the man, hisreticence was really from a fear lest in speaking at all he mightspeak too freely, might betray the pervasive violence of hisfeeling. So, he sat motionless and wordless, his eyes carefullyavoiding Mary in order that she might not be disturbed by theinvisible vibrations thus sent from one to another. Mary herselfwas shaken to the depths. A great weariness, a weariness thatcried the worthlessness of all things, had fallen upon her. Itrested leaden on her soul. It weighed down her body as well,though that mattered little indeed. Yet, since she couldminister to that readily, she rose and went to a settee on theopposite side of the room where she arranged herself among thecushions in a posture more luxurious than her rather preciseearly training usually permitted her to assume in the presence ofothers. There she rested, and soon felt the tides of energyagain flowing in her blood, and that same vitality, too, wroughthealing even for her agonized soul, though more slowly. Theperfect health of her gave her strength to recover speedily fromthe shock she had sustained. It was this health that made theglory of the flawless skin, white with a living white thatrevealed the coursing blood beneath, and the crimson lips thatbent in smiles so tender, or so wistful, and the limpid eyes inwhich always lurked fires that sometimes burst into flame, thelustrous mass of undulating hair that sparkled in the sunlightlike an aureole to her face or framed it in heavy splendors withits shadows, and the supple erectness of her graceful carriage,the lithe dignity of her every movement.</p> 
<p>　　But, at last, she stirred uneasily and sat up. Garson acceptedthis as a sufficient warrant for speech.</p> 
<p>　　"You know--Aggie told you--that Cassidy was up here fromHeadquarters. He didn't put a name to it, but I'm on." Maryregarded him inquiringly, and he continued, putting the fact witha certain brutal bluntness after the habit of his class. "Iguess you'll have to quit seeing young Gilder. The bulls arewise. His father has made a holler.</p> 
<p>　　"Don't let that worry you, Joe," she said tranquilly. She alloweda few seconds go by, then added as if quite indifferent: "I wasmarried to Dick Gilder this morning." There came a squeal ofamazement from Aggie, a start of incredulity from Garson.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes," Mary repeated evenly, "I was married to him this morning.</p> 
<p>　　That was my important engagement," she added with a smile towardAggie. For some intuitive reason, mysterious to herself, she didnot care to meet the man's eyes at that moment.</p> 
<p>　　Aggie sat erect, her baby face alive with worldly glee.</p> 
<p>　　"My Gawd, what luck!" she exclaimed noisily. "Why, he's a kingfish, he is. Gee! But I'm glad you landed him!""Thank you," Mary said with a smile that was the result of hersense of humor rather than from any tenderness.</p> 
<p>　　It was then that Garson spoke. He was a delicate man in hissensibilities at times, in spite of the fact that he followeddevious methods in his manner of gaining a livelihood. So, now,he put a question of vital significance.</p> 
<p>　　"Do you love him?"The question caught Mary all unprepared, but she retained herself-control sufficiently to make her answer in a voice that tothe ordinary ear would have revealed no least tremor.</p> 
<p>　　"No," she said. She offered no explanation, no excuse, merelystated the fact in all its finality.</p> 
<p>　　Aggie was really shocked, though for a reason altogether sordid,not one whit romantic.</p> 
<p>　　"Ain't he young?" she demanded aggressively. "Ain't hegood-looking, and loose with his money something scandalous? IfI met up with a fellow as liberal as him, if he was three timeshis age, I could simply adore him!"It was Garson who pressed the topic with an inexorable curiosityborn of his unselfish interest in the woman concerned.</p> 
<p>　　"Then, why did you marry him?" he asked. The sincerity of himwas excuse enough for the seeming indelicacy of the question.</p> 
<p>　　Besides, he felt himself somehow responsible. He had given backto her the gift of life, which she had rejected. Surely, he hadthe right to know the truth.</p> 
<p>　　It seemed that Mary believed her confidence his due, for she toldhim the fact.</p> 
<p>　　"I have been working and scheming for nearly a year to do it,"she said, with a hardening of her face that spoke of indomitableresolve. "Now, it's done." A vindictive gleam shot from herviolet eyes as she added: "It's only the beginning, too."Garson, with the keen perspicacity that had made him a successfulcriminal without a single conviction to mar his record, hadseized the implication in her statement, and now put it in words.</p> 
<p>　　"Then, you won't leave us? We're going on as we were before?"The hint of dejection in his manner had vanished. "And you won'tlive with him?""Live with him?" Mary exclaimed emphatically. "Certainly not!"Aggie's neatly rounded jaw dropped in a gape of surprise that wasmost unladylike.</p> 
<p>　　"You are going to live on in this joint with us?" shequestioned, aghast.</p> 
<p>　　"Of course." The reply was given with the utmost of certainty.</p> 
<p>　　Aggie presented the crux of the matter.</p> 
<p>　　"Where will hubby live?"There was no lessening of the bride's composure as she replied,with a little shrug.</p> 
<p>　　"Anywhere but here."Aggie suddenly giggled. To her sense of humor there wassomething vastly diverting in this new scheme of giving bliss toa fond husband.</p> 
<p>　　"Anywhere but here," she repeated gaily. "Oh, won't that benice--for him? Oh, yes! Oh, quite so! Oh, yes, indeed--quiteso--so!"Garson, however, was still patient in his determination toapprehend just what had come to pass.</p> 
<p>　　"Does he understand the arrangement?" was his question.</p> 
<p>　　"No, not yet," Mary admitted, without sign of embarrassment.</p> 
<p>　　"Well," Aggie said, with another giggle, "when you do get aroundto tell him, break it to him gently."Garson was intently considering another phase of the situation,one suggested perhaps out of his own deeper sentiments.</p> 
<p>　　"He must think a lot of you!" he said, gravely. "Don't he?"For the first time, Mary was moved to the display of a slightconfusion. She hesitated a little before her answer, and whenshe spoke it was in a lower key, a little more slowly.</p> 
<p>　　"I--I suppose so."Aggie presented the truth more subtly than could have beenexpected from her.</p> 
<p>　　"Think a lot of you? Of course he does! Thinks enough to marryyou! And believe me, kid, when a man thinks enough of you tomarry you, well, that's some thinking!"Somehow, the crude expression of this professional adventuresspenetrated to Mary's conscience, though it held in it the truthto which her conscience bore witness, to which she had tried toshut her ears.... And now from the man came something like adraught of elixir to her conscience--like the trump of doom toher scheme of vengeance.</p> 
<p>　　Garson spoke very softly, but with an intensity that left nodoubt as to the honesty of his purpose.</p> 
<p>　　"I'd say, throw up the whole game and go to him, if you reallycare."There fell a tense silence. It was broken by Mary herself. Shespoke with a touch of haste, as if battling against somehindrance within.</p> 
<p>　　"I married him to get even with his father," she said. "That'sall there is to it.... By the way, I expect Dick will be here ina minute or two. When he comes, just remember not to--enlightenhim."Aggie sniffed indignantly.</p> 
<p>　　"Don't worry about me, not a mite. Whenever it's really wanted,I'm always there with a full line of that lady stuff."Thereupon, she sprang up, and proceeded to give her conception ofthe proper welcoming of the happy bridegroom. The performancewas amusing enough in itself, but for some reason it movedneither of the two for whom it was rendered to more thanperfunctory approval. The fact had no depressing effect on theperformer, however, and it was only the coming of the maid thatput her lively sallies to an end.</p> 
<p>　　"Mr. Gilder," Fannie announced.</p> 
<p>　　Mary put a question with so much of energy that Garson beganfinally to understand the depth of her vindictive feeling.</p> 
<p>　　"Any one with him?""No, Miss Turner," the maid answered.</p> 
<p>　　"Have him come in," Mary ordered.</p> 
<p>　　Garson felt that he would be better away for the sake of thenewly married pair at least, if not for his own. He made hastyexcuses and went out on the heels of the maid. Aggie, however,consulting only her own wishes in the matter, had no thought offlight, and, if the truth be told, Mary was glad of thesustaining presence of another woman.</p> 
<p>　　She got up slowly, and stood silent, while Aggie regarded hercuriously. Even to the insensitive observer, there was somethingstrange in the atmosphere.... A moment later the bridegroomentered.</p> 
<p>　　He was still clean-cut and wholesome. Some sons of wealthyfathers are not, after four years experience of the white lightsof town. And the lines of his face were firmer, better in everyway. It seemed, indeed, that here was some one of a resolutecharacter, not to be wasted on the trivial and gross things. Inan instant, he had gone to her, had caught her in his arms with,"Hello, dear!" smothered in the kiss he implanted on her lips.</p> 
<p>　　Mary strove vainly to free herself.</p> 
<p>　　"Don't, oh, don't!" she gasped.</p> 
<p>　　Dick Gilder released his wife from his arms and smiled thebeatific smile of the newly-wed.</p> 
<p>　　"Why not?" he demanded, with a smile, a smile calm, triumphant,masterful.</p> 
<p>　　"Agnes!" ... It was the sole pretext to which Mary could turn fora momentary relief.</p> 
<p>　　The bridegroom faced about, and perceived Agnes, who stoodclosely watching the meeting between husband and wife. He madean excellent formal bow of the sort that one learns only abroad,and spoke quietly.</p> 
<p>　　"I beg your pardon, Miss Lynch, but"--a smile of perfecthappiness shone on his face--"you could hardly expect me to seeany one but Mary under the circumstances. Could you?"Aggie strove to rise to this emergency, and again took on herbest manner, speaking rather coldly.</p> 
<p>　　"Under what circumstances?" she inquired.</p> 
<p>　　The young man exclaimed joyously.</p> 
<p>　　"Why, we were married this morning."Aggie accepted the news with fitting excitement.</p> 
<p>　　"Goodness gracious! How perfectly lovely!"The bridegroom regarded her with a face that was luminous ofdelight.</p> 
<p>　　"You bet, it's lovely!" he declared with entire conviction. Heturned to Mary, his face glowing with satisfaction.</p> 
<p>　　"Mary," he said, "I have the honeymoon trip all fixed. TheMauretania sails at five in the morning, so we will----"A cold voice struck suddenly through this rhapsodizing. It wasthat of the bride.</p> 
<p>　　"Where is your father?" she asked, without any trace of emotion.</p> 
<p>　　The bridegroom stopped short, and a deep blush spread itself overhis boyish face. His tone was filled full to overflowing withcompunction as he answered.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, Lord! I had forgotten all about Dad." He beamed on Marywith a smile half-ashamed, half-happy. "I'm awfully sorry," hesaid earnestly. "I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll send Dad awireless from the ship, then write him from Paris."But the confident tone brought no response of agreement fromMary. On the contrary, her voice was, if anything, even colderas she replied to his suggestion. She spoke with an emphasis thatbrooked no evasion.</p> 
<p>　　"What was your promise? I told you that I wouldn't go with youuntil you had brought your father to me, and he had wished ushappiness." Dick placed his hands gently on his wife's shouldersand regarded her with a touch of indignation in his gaze.</p> 
<p>　　"Mary," he said reproachfully, "you are not going to hold me tothat promise?"The answer was given with a decisiveness that admitted of noquestion, and there was a hardness in her face that emphasizedthe words.</p> 
<p>　　"I am going to hold you to that promise, Dick."For a few seconds, the young man stared at her with troubledeyes. Then he moved impatiently, and dropped his hands from hershoulders. But his usual cheery smile came again, and heshrugged resignedly.</p> 
<p>　　"All right, Mrs. Gilder," he said, gaily. The sound of the nameprovoked him to new pleasure. "Sounds fine, doesn't it?" hedemanded, with an uxorious air.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes," Mary said, but there was no enthusiasm in her tone.</p> 
<p>　　The husband went on speaking with no apparent heed of his wife'sindifference.</p> 
<p>　　"You pack up what things you need, girlie," he directed. "Just afew--because they sell clothes in Paris. And they are some class,believe me! And meantime, I'll run down to Dad's office, and havehim back here in half an hour. You will be all ready, won'tyou?"Mary answered quickly, with a little catching of her breath, butstill coldly.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes, yes, I'll be ready. Go and bring your father.""You bet I will," Dick cried heartily. He would have taken herin his arms again, but she evaded the caress. "What's thematter?" he demanded, plainly at a loss to understand thisrepulse.</p> 
<p>　　"Nothing!" was the ambiguous answer.</p> 
<p>　　"Just one!" Dick pleaded.</p> 
<p>　　"No," the bride replied, and there was determination in themonosyllable.</p> 
<p>　　It was evident that Dick perceived the futility of argument.</p> 
<p>　　"For a married woman you certainly are shy," he replied, with asly glance toward Aggie, who beamed back sympathy. "You'llexcuse me, won't you, Miss Lynch,... Good-by, Mrs. Gilder." Hemade a formal bow to his wife. As he hurried to the door, heexpressed again his admiration for the name. "Mrs. Gilder!</p> 
<p>　　Doesn't that sound immense?" And with that he was gone.</p> 
<p>　　There was silence in the drawing-room until the two women heardthe closing of the outer door of the apartment. Then, at last,Aggie relieved her pent-up emotions in a huge sigh that was neara groan.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh Gawd!" she gasped. "The poor simp!"</p>
