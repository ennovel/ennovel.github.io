The day had been a trying one, and, thoughher superb health could endure much, she felt that both prudenceand comfort required that she should recruit her energies whilethere was opportunity. She was not in the least surprised thatDick had not yet returned, though he had mentioned half an hour.</p> 
<p>　　At the best, there were many things that might detain him, hisfather's absence from the office, difficulties in makingarrangements for his projected honeymoon trip abroad--which wouldnever occur--or the like. At the worst, there was a chance offinding his father promptly, and of that father as promptlytaking steps to prevent the son from ever again seeing the womanwho had so indiscreetly married him. Yet, somehow, Mary couldnot believe that her husband would yield to such paternalcoercion. Rather, she was sure that he would prove loyal to herwhom he loved, through every trouble. At the thought a certainwistfulness pervaded her, and a poignant regret that thisparticular man should have been the one chosen of fate to beentangled within her mesh of revenge. There throbbed in her aheart-tormenting realization that there were in lifepossibilities infinitely more splendid than the joy of vengeance.</p> 
<p>　　She would not confess the truth even to her inmost soul, but thetruth was there, and set her a-tremble with vague fears.</p> 
<p>　　Nevertheless, because she was in perfect health, and was muchfatigued, her introspection did not avail to keep her awake, andwithin three minutes from the time she lay down she wasblissfully unconscious of all things, both the evil and the good,revenge and love.</p> 
<p>　　She had slept, perhaps, a half-hour, when Fannie awakened her.</p> 
<p>　　"It's a man named Burke," she explained, as her mistress layblinking. "And there's another man with him. They said theymust see you."By this time, Mary was wide-awake, for the name of Burke, thePolice Inspector, was enough to startle her out of drowsiness.</p> 
<p>　　"Bring them in, in five minutes," she directed.</p> 
<p>　　She got up, slipped into a tea-gown, bathed her eyes in cologne,dressed her hair a little, and went into the drawing-room, wherethe two men had been waiting for something more than a quarter ofan hour--to the violent indignation of both.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, here you are, at last!" the big, burly man cried as sheentered. The whole air of him, though he was in civilian'sclothes, proclaimed the policeman.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes, Inspector," Mary replied pleasantly, as she advanced intothe room. She gave a glance toward the other visitor, who was ofa slenderer form, with a thin, keen face, and recognized himinstantly as Demarest, who had taken part against her as thelawyer for the store at the time of her trial, and who was nowholding the office of District Attorney. She went to the chairat the desk, and seated herself in a leisurely fashion thatincreased the indignation of the fuming Inspector. She did nottrouble to ask her self-invited guests to sit.</p> 
<p>　　"To whom do I owe the pleasure of this visit, Inspector?" sheremarked coolly. It was noticeable that she said whom and notwhat, as if she understood perfectly that the influence of someperson brought him on this errand.</p> 
<p>　　"I have come to have a few quiet words with you," the Inspectordeclared, in a mighty voice that set the globes of thechandeliers a-quiver. Mary disregarded him, and turned to theother man.</p> 
<p>　　"How do you do, Mr. Demarest?" she said, evenly. "It's fouryears since we met, and they've made you District Attorney sincethen. Allow me to congratulate you."Demarest's keen face took on an expression of perplexity.</p> 
<p>　　"I'm puzzled," he confessed. "There is something familiar,somehow, about you, and yet----" He scrutinized appreciativelythe loveliness of the girl with her classically beautiful face,that was still individual in its charm, the slim graces of thetall, lissome form. "I should have remembered you. I don'tunderstand it.""Can't you guess?" Mary questioned, somberly. "Search yourmemory, Mr. Demarest."Of a sudden, the face of the District Attorney lightened.</p> 
<p>　　"Why," he exclaimed, "you are--it can't be--yes--you are thegirl, you're the Mary Turner whom I--oh, I know you now."There was an enigmatic smile bending the scarlet lips as sheanswered.</p> 
<p>　　"I'm the girl you mean, Mr. Demarest, but, for the rest, youdon't know me--not at all!"The burly figure of the Inspector of Police, which had loomedmotionless during this colloquy, now advanced a step, and the bigvoice boomed threatening. It was very rough and weighted withauthority.</p> 
<p>　　"Young woman," Burke said, peremptorily, "the Twentieth CenturyLimited leaves Grand Central Station at four o'clock. It arrivesin Chicago at eight-fifty-five to-morrow morning." He pulled amassive gold watch from his waistcoat pocket, glanced at it,thrust it back, and concluded ponderously: "You will just abouthave time to catch that train."Mary regarded the stockily built officer with a half-amusedcontempt, which she was at no pains to conceal.</p> 
<p>　　"Working for the New York Central now?" she asked blandly.</p> 
<p>　　The gibe made the Inspector furious.</p> 
<p>　　"I'm working for the good of New York City," he answeredvenomously.</p> 
<p>　　Mary let a ripple of cadenced laughter escape her.</p> 
<p>　　"Since when?" she questioned.</p> 
<p>　　A little smile twisted the lips of the District Attorney, but hecaught himself quickly, and spoke with stern gravity.</p> 
<p>　　"Miss Turner, I think you will find that a different tone willserve you better.""Oh, let her talk," Burke interjected angrily. "She's only got afew minutes anyway."Mary remained unperturbed.</p> 
<p>　　"Very well, then," she said genially, "let us be comfortableduring that little period." She made a gesture of invitationtoward chairs, which Burke disdained to accept; but Demarestseated himself.</p> 
<p>　　"You'd better be packing your trunk," the Inspector rumbled.</p> 
<p>　　"But why?" Mary inquired, with a tantalizing assumption ofinnocence. "I'm not going away.""On the Twentieth Century Limited, this afternoon," the Inspectordeclared, in a voice of growing wrath.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, dear, no!" Mary's assertion was made very quietly, but withan underlying firmness that irritated the official beyondendurance.</p> 
<p>　　"I say yes!" The answer was a bellow.</p> 
<p>　　Mary appeared distressed, not frightened. Her words were anironic protest against the man's obstreperous noisiness, no more.</p> 
<p>　　"I thought you wanted quiet words with me."Burke went toward her, in a rage.</p> 
<p>　　"Now, look here, Mollie----" he began harshly.</p> 
<p>　　On the instant, Mary was on her feet, facing him, and there was agleam in her eyes as they met his that bade him pause.</p> 
<p>　　"Miss Turner, if you don't mind." She laughed slightly. "Forthe present, anyway." She reseated herself tranquilly.</p> 
<p>　　Burke was checked, but he retained his severity of bearing.</p> 
<p>　　"I'm giving you your orders. You will either go to Chicago, oryou'll go up the river."Mary answered in a voice charged with cynicism.</p> 
<p>　　"If you can convict me. Pray, notice that little word 'if'."The District Attorney interposed very suavely.</p> 
<p>　　"I did once, remember.""But you can't do it again," Mary declared, with an assurancethat excited the astonishment of the police official.</p> 
<p>　　"How do you know he can't?" he blustered.</p> 
<p>　　Mary laughed in a cadence of genial merriment.</p> 
<p>　　"Because," she replied gaily, "if he could, he would have had mein prison some time ago."Burke winced, but he made shift to conceal his realization of thetruth she had stated to him.</p> 
<p>　　"Huh!" he exclaimed gruffly. "I've seen them go up pretty easy."Mary met the assertion with a serenity that was baffling.</p> 
<p>　　"The poor ones," she vouchsafed; "not those that have money. Ihave money, plenty of money--now.""Money you stole!" the Inspector returned, brutally.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, dear, no!" Mary cried, with a fine show of virtuousindignation.</p> 
<p>　　"What about the thirty thousand dollars you got on thatpartnership swindle?" Burke asked, sneering. "I s'pose youdidn't steal that!""Certainly not," was the ready reply. "The man advertised for apartner in a business sure to bring big and safe returns. Ianswered. The business proposed was to buy a tract of land, andsubdivide it. The deeds to the land were all forged, and thesupposed seller was his confederate, with whom he was to dividethe money. We formed a partnership, with a capital of sixtythousand dollars. We paid the money into the bank, and then atonce I drew it out. You see, he wanted to get my moneyillegally, but instead I managed to get his legally. For it waslegal for me to draw that money--wasn't it, Mr. Demarest?"The District Attorney by an effort retained his severe expressionof righteous disapprobation, but he admitted the truth of hercontention.</p> 
<p>　　"Unfortunately, yes," he said gravely. "A partner has the rightto draw out any, or all, of the partnership funds.""And I was a partner," Mary said contentedly. "You, see,Inspector, you wrong me--you do, really! I'm not a swindler; I'ma financier."Burke sneered scornfully.</p> 
<p>　　"Well," he roared, "you'll never pull another one on me. You cangamble on that!"Mary permitted herself to laugh mockingly in the face of thebadgered official.</p> 
<p>　　"Thank you for telling me," she said, graciously. "And let mesay, incidentally, that Miss Lynch at the present moment ispainlessly extracting ten thousand dollars from General Hastingsin a perfectly legal manner, Inspector Burke.""Well, anyhow," Burke shouted, "you may stay inside the law, butyou've got to get outside the city." He tried to employ anelephantine bantering tone. "On the level, now, do you think youcould get away with that young Gilder scheme you've beenplanning?"Mary appeared puzzled.</p> 
<p>　　"What young Gilder scheme?" she asked, her brows drawn inbewilderment.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, I'm wise--I'm wise!" the Inspector cried roughly. "Theanswer is, once for all, leave town this afternoon, or you'll bein the Tombs in the morning."Abruptly, a change came over the woman. Hitherto, she had beencynical, sarcastic, laughing, careless, impudent. Now, of asudden, she was all seriousness, and she spoke with a gravitythat, despite their volition, impressed both the men before her.</p> 
<p>　　"It can't be done, Inspector," she said, sedately.</p> 
<p>　　The declaration, simple as it was, aroused the official to newindignation.</p> 
<p>　　"Who says it can't?" he vociferated, overflowing with anger atthis flouting of the authority he represented.</p> 
<p>　　Mary opened a drawer of the desk, and took out the documentobtained that morning from Harris, and held it forth.</p> 
<p>　　"This," she replied, succinctly.</p> 
<p>　　"What's this?" Burke stormed. But he took the paper.</p> 
<p>　　Demarest looked over the Inspector's shoulder, and his eyes grewlarger as he read. When he was at an end of the reading, heregarded the passive woman at the desk with a new respect.</p> 
<p>　　"What's this?" Burke repeated helplessly. It was not easy forhim to interpret the legal phraseology. Mary was kind enough tomake the document clear to him.</p> 
<p>　　"It's a temporary restraining order from the Supreme Court,instructing you to let me alone until you have legal proof that Ihave broken the law.... Do you get that, Mr. Inspector Burke?"The plethoric official stared hard at the injunction.</p> 
<p>　　"Another new one," he stuttered finally. Then his anger soughtvent in violent assertion. "But it can't be done!" he shouted.</p> 
<p>　　"You might ask Mr. Demarest," Mary suggested, pleasantly, "as towhether or not it can be done. The gambling houses can do it,and so keep on breaking the law. The race track men can do it,and laugh at the law. The railroad can do it, to restrain itsemployees from striking. So, why shouldn't I get one, too? Yousee, I have money. I can buy all the law I want. And there'snothing you can't do with the law, if you have money enough....</p> 
<p>　　Ask Mr. Demarest. He knows."Burke was fairly gasping over this outrage against his authority.</p> 
<p>　　"Can you beat that!" he rumbled with a raucously sonorousvehemence. He regarded Mary with a stare of almost reverentialwonder. "A crook appealing to the law!"There came a new note into the woman's voice as she answered thegibe.</p> 
<p>　　"No, simply getting justice," she said simply. "That's theremarkable part of it." She threw off her serious air. "Well,gentlemen," she concluded, "what are you going to do about it?"Burke explained.</p> 
<p>　　"This is what I'm going to do about it. One way or another, I'mgoing to get you."The District Attorney, however, judged it advisable to use morepersuasive methods.</p> 
<p>　　"Miss Turner," he said, with an appearance of sincerity, "I'mgoing to appeal to your sense of fair play."Mary's shining eyes met his for a long moment, and before thechallenge in hers, his fell. He remembered then those doubtsthat had assailed him when this girl had been sentenced toprison, remembered the half-hearted plea he had made in herbehalf to Richard Gilder.</p> 
<p>　　"That was killed," Mary said, "killed four years ago."But Demarest persisted. Influence had been brought to bear onhim. It was for her own sake now that he urged her.</p> 
<p>　　"Let young Gilder alone."Mary laughed again. But there was no hint of joyousness in themusical tones. Her answer was frank--brutally frank. She hadnothing to conceal.</p> 
<p>　　"His father sent me away for three years--three years forsomething I didn't do. Well, he's got to pay for it."By this time, Burke, a man of superior intelligence, as one mustbe to reach such a position of authority, had come to realizethat here was a case not to be carried through by blustering, byintimidation, by the rough ruses familiar to the force. Here wasa woman of extraordinary intelligence, as well as of peculiarpersonal charm, who merely made sport of his fulminations, andshowed herself essentially armed against anything he might do, bya court injunction, a thing unheard of until this moment in thecase of a common crook. It dawned upon him that this was,indeed, not a common crook. Moreover, there had grown in him acertain admiration for the ingenuity and resource of this woman,though he retained all his rancor against one who dared thus toresist the duly constituted authority. So, in the end, he spoketo her frankly, without a trace of his former virulence, with avery real, if rugged, sincerity.</p> 
<p>　　"Don't fool yourself, my girl," he said in his huge voice, whichwas now modulated to a degree that made it almost unfamiliar tohimself. "You can't go through with this. There's always a weaklink in the chain somewhere. It's up to me to find it, and Iwill."His candor moved her to a like honesty.</p> 
<p>　　"Now," she said, and there was respect in the glance she gave thestalwart man, "now you really sound dangerous."There came an interruption, alike unexpected by all. Fannieappeared at the door.</p> 
<p>　　"Mr. Edward Gilder wishes to see you, Miss Turner," she said,with no appreciation of anything dynamic in the announcement.</p> 
<p>　　"Shall I show him in?""Oh, certainly," Mary answered, with an admirable pretense ofindifference, while Burke glared at Demarest, and the DistrictAttorney appeared ill at ease.</p> 
<p>　　"He shouldn't have come," Demarest muttered, getting to his feet,in reply to the puzzled glance of the Inspector.</p> 
<p>　　Then, while Mary sat quietly in her chair at the desk, and thetwo men stood watching doubtfully the door, the maid appeared,stood aside, and said simply, "Mr. Gilder."There entered the erect, heavy figure of the man whom Mary hadhated through the years. He stopped abruptly just within theroom, gave a glance at the two men, then his eyes went to Mary,sitting at her desk, with her face lifted inquiringly. He didnot pause to take in the beauty of that face, only its strength.</p> 
<p>　　He stared at her silently for a moment. Then he spoke in hisoritund voice, a little tremulous from anxiety.</p> 
<p>　　"Are you the woman?" he said. There was something simple andprimitive, something of dignity beyond the usual conventions, inhis direct address.</p> 
<p>　　And there was the same primitive simplicity in the answer.</p> 
<p>　　Between the two strong natures there was no subterfuge, nosuggestion of polite evasions, of tergiversation, only the pleaof truth to truth. Mary's acknowledgment was as plain as his ownquestion.</p> 
<p>　　"I am the woman. What do you want?" ... Thus two honest folk hadmet face to face.</p> 
<p>　　"My son." The man's answer was complete.</p> 
<p>　　But Mary touched a tragic note in her question. It was asked inno frivolous spirit, but, of a sudden, she guessed that hiscoming was altogether of his own volition, and not the result ofhis son's information, as at first she had supposed.</p> 
<p>　　"Have you seen him recently?" she asked.</p> 
<p>　　"No," Gilder answered.</p> 
<p>　　"Then, why did you come?"Thereat, the man was seized with a fatherly fury. His heavy facewas congested, and his sonorous voice was harsh with virtuousrebuke.</p> 
<p>　　"Because I intend to save my boy from a great folly. I aminformed that he is infatuated with you, and Inspector Burketells me why--he tells me--why--he tells me----" He paused,unable for a moment to continue from an excess of emotion. Buthis gray eyes burned fiercely in accusation against her.</p> 
<p>　　Inspector Burke himself filled the void in the halting sentence.</p> 
<p>　　"I told you she had been an ex-convict.""Yes," Gilder said, after he had regained his self-control. Hestared at her pleadingly. "Tell me," he said with a certaindignity, "is this true?"Here, then, was the moment for which she had longed through wearydays, through weary years. Here was the man whom she hated,suppliant before her to know the truth. Her heart quickened.</p> 
<p>　　Truly, vengeance is sweet to one who has suffered unjustly.</p> 
<p>　　"Is this true?" the man repeated, with something of horror inhis voice.</p> 
<p>　　"It is," Mary said quietly.</p> 
<p>　　For a little, there was silence in the room. Once, InspectorBurke started to speak, but the magnate made an imperativegesture, and the officer held his peace. Always, Mary restedmotionless. Within her, a fierce joy surged. Here was the timeof her victory. Opposite her was the man who had caused heranguish, the man whose unjust action had ruined her life. Now,he was her humble petitioner, but this servility could be of noavail to save him from shame. He must drink of the dregs ofhumiliation--and then again. No price were too great to pay fora wrong such as that which he had put upon her.</p> 
<p>　　At last, Gilder was restored in a measure to his self-possession.</p> 
<p>　　He spoke with the sureness of a man of wealth, confident thatmoney will salve any wound.</p> 
<p>　　"How much?" he asked, baldly.</p> 
<p>　　Mary smiled an inscrutable smile.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, I don't need money," she said, carelessly. "Inspector Burkewill tell you how easy it is for me to get it."Gilder looked at her with a newly dawning respect; then hisshrewdness suggested a retort.</p> 
<p>　　"Do you want my son to learn what you are?" he said.</p> 
<p>　　Mary laughed. There was something dreadful in that burst ofspurious amusement.</p> 
<p>　　"Why not?" she answered. "I'm ready to tell him myself."Then Gilder showed the true heart of him, in which love for hisboy was before all else. He found himself wholly at a lossbefore the woman's unexpected reply.</p> 
<p>　　"But I don't want him to know," he stammered. "Why, I've sparedthe boy all his life. If he really loves you--it will----"At that moment, the son himself entered hurriedly from thehallway. In his eagerness, he saw no one save the woman whom heloved. At his entrance, Mary rose and moved backward a stepinvoluntarily, in sheer surprise over his coming, even though shehad known he must come--perhaps from some other emotion, deeper,hidden as yet even from herself.</p> 
<p>　　The young man, with his wholesome face alight with tenderness,went swiftly to her, while the other three men stood silent,motionless, abashed by the event. And Dick took Mary's hand in awarm clasp, pressed it tenderly.</p> 
<p>　　"I didn't see father," he said happily, "but I left him a note onhis desk at the office."Then, somehow, the surcharged atmosphere penetrated hisconsciousness, and he looked around, to see his father standinggrimly opposite him. But there was no change in his expressionbeyond a more radiant smile.</p> 
<p>　　"Hello, Dad!" he cried, joyously. "Then you got my note?"The voice of the older man came with a sinister force andsaturnine.</p> 
<p>　　"No, Dick, I haven't had any note.""Then, why?" The young man broke off suddenly. He was becomeaware that here was something malignant, with a meaning beyondhis present understanding, for he saw the Inspector and Demarest,and he knew the two of them for what they were officially.</p> 
<p>　　"What are they doing here?" he demanded suspiciously, staring atthe two.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, never mind them," Mary said. There was a malevolent gleamin her violet eyes. This was the recompense of which she haddreamed through soul-tearing ages. "Just tell your father yournews, Dick."The young man had no comprehension of the fact that he was only apawn in the game. He spoke with simple pride.</p> 
<p>　　"Dad, we're married. Mary and I were married this morning."Always, Mary stared with her eyes steadfast on the father. Therewas triumph in her gaze. This was the vengeance for which shehad longed, for which she had plotted, the vengeance she had atlast achieved. Here was her fruition, the period of hersupremacy.</p> 
<p>　　Gilder himself seemed dazed by the brief sentence.</p> 
<p>　　"Say that again," he commanded.</p> 
<p>　　Mary rejoiced to make the knowledge sure.</p> 
<p>　　"I married your son this morning," she said in a matter-of-facttone. "I married him. Do you quite understand, Mr. Gilder? Imarried him." In that insistence lay her ultimate compensationfor untold misery. The father stood there wordless, unable tofind speech against this calamity that had befallen him.</p> 
<p>　　It was Burke who offered a diversion, a crude interruption afterhis own fashion.</p> 
<p>　　"It's a frame-up," he roared. He glared at the young man. "Tellyour father it ain't true. Why, do you know what she is? She'sdone time." He paused for an instant, then spoke in a voice thatwas brutally menacing. "And, by God, she'll do it again!"The young man turned toward his bride. There was disbelief,hope, despair, in his face, which had grown older by years withthe passing of the seconds.</p> 
<p>　　"It's a lie, Mary," he said. "Say it's a lie!" He seized herhand passionately.</p> 
<p>　　There was no quiver in her voice as she answered. She drew herhand from his clasp, and spoke evenly.</p> 
<p>　　"It's the truth.""It's the truth!" the young man repeated, incredulously.</p> 
<p>　　"It is the truth," Mary said, firmly. "I have served three yearsin prison."There was a silence of a minute that was like years. It was thefather who broke it, and now his voice was become tremulous.</p> 
<p>　　"I wanted to save you, Dick. That's why I came."The son interrupted him violently.</p> 
<p>　　"There's a mistake--there must be."It was Demarest who gave an official touch to the tragedy of themoment.</p> 
<p>　　"There's no mistake," he said. There was authority in hisstatement.</p> 
<p>　　"There is, I tell you!" Dick cried, horrified by this conspiracyof defamation. He turned his tortured face to his bride of aday.</p> 
<p>　　"Mary," he said huskily, "there is a mistake."Something in her face appalled him. He was voiceless for a fewterrible instants. Then he spoke again, more beseechingly.</p> 
<p>　　"Say there's a mistake."Mary preserved her poise. Yes--she must not forget! This was thehour of her triumph. What mattered it that the honey of it wasas ashes in her mouth? She spoke with a simplicity that admittedno denial.</p> 
<p>　　"It's all quite true."The man who had so loved her, so trusted her, was overwhelmed bythe revelation. He stood trembling for a moment, tottered,almost it seemed would have fallen, but presently steadiedhimself and sank supinely into a chair, where he sat in impotentsuffering.</p> 
<p>　　The father looked at Mary with a reproach that was pathetic.</p> 
<p>　　"See," he said, and his heavy voice was for once thin withpassion," see what you've done to my boy!"Mary had held her eyes on Dick. There had been in her gaze aconflict of emotions, strong and baffling. Now, however, when thefather spoke, her face grew more composed, and her eyes met hiscoldly. Her voice was level and vaguely dangerous as sheanswered his accusation.</p> 
<p>　　"What is that compared to what you have done to me?"Gilder stared at her in honest amazement. He had no suspicion asto the tragedy that lay between him and her.</p> 
<p>　　"What have I done to you?" he questioned, uncomprehending.</p> 
<p>　　Mary moved forward, passing beyond the desk, and continued heradvance toward him until the two stood close together, face toface. She spoke softly, but with an intensity of supreme feelingin her voice.</p> 
<p>　　"Do you remember what I said to you the day you had me sentaway?"The merchant regarded her with stark lack of understanding.</p> 
<p>　　"I don't remember you at all," he said.</p> 
<p>　　The woman looked at him intently for a moment, then spoke in acolorless voice.</p> 
<p>　　"Perhaps you remember Mary Turner, who was arrested four yearsago for robbing your store. And perhaps you remember that sheasked to speak to you before they took her to prison."The heavy-jowled man gave a start.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, you begin to remember. Yes! There was a girl who swore shewas innocent--yes, she swore that she was innocent. And shewould have got off--only, you asked the judge to make an exampleof her."The man to whom she spoke had gone gray a little. He began tounderstand, for he was not lacking in intelligence. Somehow, itwas borne in on him that this woman had a grievance beyond theusual run of injuries.</p> 
<p>　　"You are that girl?" he said. It was not a question, rather anaffirmation.</p> 
<p>　　Mary spoke with the dignity of long suffering--more than that,with the confident dignity of a vengeance long delayed, now atlast achieved. Her words were simple enough, but they touched tothe heart of the man accused by them.</p> 
<p>　　"I am that girl."There was a little interval of silence. Then, Mary spoke again,remorselessly.</p> 
<p>　　"You took away my good name. You smashed my life. You put mebehind the bars. You owe for all that.... Well' I've begun tocollect."The man opposite her, the man of vigorous form, of strong faceand keen eyes, stood gazing intently for long moments. In thattime, he was learning many things. Finally, he spoke.</p> 
<p>　　"And that is why you married my boy.""It is." Mary gave the answer coldly, convincingly.</p> 
<p>　　Convincingly, save to one--her husband. Dick suddenly aroused,and spoke with the violence of one sure.</p> 
<p>　　"It is not!"Burke shouted a warning. Demarest, more diplomatic, made arestraining gesture toward the police official, then started toaddress the young man soothingly.</p> 
<p>　　But Dick would have none of their interference.</p> 
<p>　　"This is my affair," he said, and the others fell silent. Hestood up and went to Mary, and took her two hands in his, verygently, yet very firmly.</p> 
<p>　　"Mary," he said softly, yet with a strength of conviction, "youmarried me because you love me."The wife shuddered, but she strove to deny.</p> 
<p>　　"No," she said gravely, "no, I did not!""And you love me now!" he went on insistingly.</p> 
<p>　　"No, no!" Mary's denial came like a cry for escape.</p> 
<p>　　"You love me now!" There was a masterful quality in hisdeclaration, which seemed to ignore her negation.</p> 
<p>　　"I don't," she repeated bitterly.</p> 
<p>　　But he was inexorable.</p> 
<p>　　"Look me in the face, and say that."He took her face in his hands, lifted it, and his eyes met herssearchingly.</p> 
<p>　　"Look me in the face, and say that," he repeated.</p> 
<p>　　There was a silence that seemed long, though it was measured inthe passing of seconds. The three watchers dared not interruptthis drama of emotions, but, at last, Mary, who had planned solong for this hour, gathered her forces and spoke valiantly. Hervoice was low, but without any weakness of doubt.</p> 
<p>　　"I do not love you."In the instant of reply, Dick Gilder, by some inspiration oflove, changed his attitude. "Just the same," he said cheerfully,"you are my wife, and I'm going to keep you and make you loveme."Mary felt a thrill of fear through her very soul.</p> 
<p>　　"You can't!" she cried harshly. "You are his son!""She's a crook!" Burke said.</p> 
<p>　　"I don't care a damn what you've been!" Dick exclaimed. "From nowon you'll go straight. You'll walk the straightest line a womanever walked. You'll put all thoughts of vengeance out of yourheart, because I'll fill it with something bigger--I'm going tomake you love me."Burke, with his rousing voice, spoke again:</p> 
<p>　　"I tell you, she's a crook!"Mary moved a little, and then turned her face toward Gilder.</p> 
<p>　　"And, if I am, who made me one? You can't send a girl to prison,and have her come out anything else."Burke swung himself around in a movement of complete disgust.</p> 
<p>　　"She didn't get her time for good behavior."Mary raised her head, haughtily, with a gesture of high disdain.</p> 
<p>　　"And I'm proud of it!" came her instant retort. "Do you knowwhat goes on there behind those stone walls? Do you, Mr.</p> 
<p>　　District Attorney, whose business it is to send girls there? Doyou know what a girl is expected to do, to get time off for goodbehavior? If you don't, ask the keepers."Gilder moved fussily.</p> 
<p>　　"And you----"Mary swayed a little, standing there before her questioner.</p> 
<p>　　"I served every minute of my time--every minute of it, threefull, whole years. Do you wonder that I want to get even, thatsome one has got to pay? Four years ago, you took away myname--and gave me a number.... Now, I've given up the number--andI've got your name."</p>
