Dick stared fora moment at the space of window left uncovered by the draperiesnow, since the man had hurried past them, without pausing to drawthem after him. Then, presently, the young man turned again toMary, and took her hand in his. The shock of the event hadsomehow steadied him, since it had drawn his thoughts from thatother more engrossing mood of concern over the crisis in his ownlife. After all, what mattered the death of this crook? hisfancy ran. The one thing of real worth in all the world was thelife that remained to be lived between him and her.... Then,violently, the selfishness of his mood was made plain to him.</p> 
<p>　　For the hand he held was shaking like some slender-stalked lilyin the clutch of the sirocco. Even as he first perceived thefact, he saw the girl stagger. His arm swept about her in avirile protecting embrace--just in time, or she would havefallen.</p> 
<p>　　A whisper came from her quivering lips. Her face was close tohis, else he could not have caught the uncertain murmuring. Thatface now was become ghastly pale. The violet eyes were widenedand dull. The muscles of her face twitched. She rested supinelyagainst him, as if bereft of any strength of body or of soul.</p> 
<p>　　Yet, in the intensity of her utterance, the feeble whisper strucklike a shriek of horror.</p> 
<p>　　"I--I--never saw any one killed before!"The simple, grisly truth of the words--words that he might havespoken as well--stirred the man to the deeps of his being. Heshuddered, as he turned his eyes to avoid seeing the thing thatlay so very near, mercifully merged within the shadows beyond thegentle radiance from the single lamp. With a pang of infinitepity for the woman in his arms, he apprehended in some degree thetorture this event must have inflicted on her. Frightful to him,it must in truth be vastly worse to her. There was her womanlysensitiveness to enhance the innate hideousness of the thing thathad been done here before their eyes. There was, too, the factthat the murderer himself had been the man to whom she owed herlife. Yes, for him, Dick realized with poignant sympathy, thehappening that night was terrible indeed: for her, as he guessednow at last, the torture must be something easily to overwhelmall her strength. His touch on her grew tender beyond theordinary tenderness of love, made gentler by a great underlyingcompassion for her misery.</p> 
<p>　　Dick drew Mary toward the couch, there let her sink down in ahuddled attitude of despair.</p> 
<p>　　"I never saw a man--killed before!" she said again. There was anote of half-hysterical, almost childish complaint in her voice.</p> 
<p>　　She moved her head a little, as if to look into the shadows where*IT lay, then checked herself violently, and looked up at herhusband with the pathetic simplicity of terror.</p> 
<p>　　"You know, Dick," she repeated dully, "I never saw a man killedbefore."Before he could utter the soothing words that rose to his lips,Dick was interrupted by a slight sound at the door. Instantly,he was all alert to meet the exigencies of the situation. Hestood by the couch, bending forward a little, as if in a postureof intimate fondness. Then, with a new thought, he got out hiscigarette-case and lighted a cigarette, after which he resumedhis former leaning over the woman as would the ardent lover. Heheard the noise again presently, now so near that he made sure ofbeing overheard, so at once he spoke with a forced cheerfulnessin his inflection.</p> 
<p>　　"I tell you, Mary," he declared, "everything's going to be allright for you and me. It was bully of you to come here to melike this."The girl made no response. She lived still in the nightmare ofmurder--that nightmare wherein she had seen Griggs fall dead tothe floor.</p> 
<p>　　Dick, in nervous apprehension as to the issue, sought to bringher to realization of the new need that had come upon them.</p> 
<p>　　"Talk to me," he commanded, very softly. "They'll be here in aminute. When they come in, pretend you just came here in orderto meet me. Try, Mary. You must, dearest!" Then, again, hisvoice rose to loudness, as he continued. "Why, I've been tryingall day to see you. And, now, here we are together, just as Iwas beginning to get really discouraged.... I know my father willeventually----"He was interrupted by the swift swinging open of the hallwaydoor. Burke stood just within the library, a revolver pointedmenacingly.</p> 
<p>　　"Hands up!--all of you!" The Inspector's voice fairly roared thecommand.</p> 
<p>　　The belligerent expression of his face vanished abruptly, as hiseyes fell on Dick standing by the couch and Mary reclining therein limp helplessness. His surprise would have been ludicrous butfor the seriousness of the situation to all concerned. Burke'sglance roved the room sharply, and he was quickly convinced thatthese two were in fact the only present spoil of his carefulplotting. His face set grimly, for the disappointment of thisminute surged fiercely within him. He started to speak, his eyeslowering as he regarded the two before him.</p> 
<p>　　But Dick forestalled him. He spoke in a voice coldly repellent.</p> 
<p>　　"What are you doing in this house at this time of night?" hedemanded. His manner was one of stern disapproval. "I recognizeyou, Inspector Burke. But you must understand that there arelimits even to what you can do. It seems to me, sir, that youexceed your authority by such an intrusion as this."Burke, however, was not a whit dismayed by the rebuke and the airof rather contemptuous disdain with which it was uttered. Hewaved his revolver toward Mary, merely as a gesture ofinquisitiveness, without any threat.</p> 
<p>　　"What's she doing here?" he asked. There was wrath in his roughvoice, for he could not avoid the surmise that his shrewdlyconcocted scheme to entrap this woman had somehow been set awry.</p> 
<p>　　"What's she doing here, I say?" he repeated heavily. His keeneyes were darting once more about the room, questing some clue tothis disturbing mystery, so hateful to his pride.</p> 
<p>　　Dick's manner became that of the devoted husband offended byimpertinent obtrusion.</p> 
<p>　　"You forget yourself, Inspector," he said, icily. "This is mywife. She has the right to be with me--her husband!"The Inspector grinned sceptically. He was moved no moreeffectively by Mary's almost hysterical effort to respond to herhusband's leading.</p> 
<p>　　"Why shouldn't I be here? Why? Why? I----"Burke broke in on the girl's pitiful histrionics ruthlessly. Hewas not in the least deceived. He was aware that somethinguntoward, as he deemed it, had occurred. It seemed to him, infact, that his finical mechanisms for the undoing of Mary Turnerwere in a fair way to be thwarted. But he would not give up thecause without a struggle. Again, he addressed himself to Dick,disregarding completely the aloof manner of the young man.</p> 
<p>　　"Where's your father?" he questioned roughly.</p> 
<p>　　"In bed, naturally," was the answer. "I ask you again: What areyou doing here at this time of night?"Burke shook his shoulders ponderously in a movement of impatienceover this prolonging of the farce.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, call your father," he directed disgustedly.</p> 
<p>　　Dick remonstrated with an excellent show of dignity.</p> 
<p>　　"It's late," he objected. "I'd rather not disturb him, if youdon't mind. Really, the idea is absurd, you know." Suddenly, hesmiled very winningly, and spoke with a good assumption ofingenuousness.</p> 
<p>　　"Inspector," he said briskly, "I see, I'll have to tell you thetruth. It's this: I've persuaded my wife to go away with me.</p> 
<p>　　She's going to give all that other sort of thing up. Yes, we'regoing away together." There was genuine triumph in his voicenow. "So, you see, we've got to talk it over. Now, then,Inspector, if you'll come back in the morning----"The official grinned sardonically. He could not in the leastguess just what had in very deed happened, but he was far tooclever a man to be bamboozled by Dick's maunderings.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, that's it!" he exclaimed, with obvious incredulity.</p> 
<p>　　"Of course," Dick replied bravely, though he knew that theInspector disbelieved his pretenses. Still, for his own part, hewas inclined as yet to be angry rather than alarmed by thisfailure to impress the officer. "You see, I didn't know----"And even in the moment of his saying, the white beam of theflashing searchlight from the Tower fell between the undrawndraperies of the octagonal window. The light startled theInspector again, as it had done once before that same night. Hisgaze followed it instinctively. So, within the second, he saw thestill form lying there on the floor--lying where had beenshadows, where now, for the passing of an instant, was brilliantradiance.</p> 
<p>　　There was no mistaking that awful, motionless, crumpled posture.</p> 
<p>　　The Inspector knew in this single instant of view that murder hadbeen done here. Even as the beam of light from the Tower shiftedand vanished from the room, he leaped to the switch by the door,and turned on the lights of the chandelier. In the next moment,he had reached the door of the passage across the room, and hiswhistle sounded shrill. His voice bellowed reinforcement to theblast.</p> 
<p>　　"Cassidy! Cassidy!"As Dick made a step toward his wife, from whom he had withdrawn alittle in his colloquy with the official, Burke voiced hiscommand viciously:</p> 
<p>　　"Stay where you are--both of you!"Cassidy came rushing in, with the other detectives. He wasplainly surprised to find the room so nearly empty, where he hadexpected to behold a gang of robbers.</p> 
<p>　　"Why, what's it all mean, Chief?" he questioned. His peeringeyes fell on Dick, standing beside Mary, and they rounded inamazement.</p> 
<p>　　"They've got Griggs!" Burke answered. There was exceeding ragein his voice, as he spoke from his kneeling posture beside thebody, to which he had hurried after the summons to his aides. Heglowered up into the bewildered face of the detective. "I'llbreak you for this, Cassidy," he declared fiercely. "Why didn'tyou get here on the run when you heard the shot?""But there wasn't any shot," the perplexed and alarmed detectiveexpostulated. He fairly stuttered in the earnestness of hisself-defense. "I tell you, Chief, there hasn't been a sound."Burke rose to his feet. His heavy face was set in its sternestmold.</p> 
<p>　　"You could drive a hearse through the hole they've made in him,"he rumbled. He wheeled on Mary and Dick. "So!" he shouted, "nowit's murder!... Well, hand it over. Where's the gun?"Followed a moment's pause. Then the Inspector spoke harshly toCassidy. He still felt himself somewhat dazed by thisextraordinary event, but he was able to cope with the situation.</p> 
<p>　　He nodded toward Dick as he gave his order: "Search him!"Before the detective could obey the direction, Dick took therevolver from his pocket where he had bestowed it, and held itout.</p> 
<p>　　And it so chanced that at this incriminating crisis for the son,the father hastily strode within the library. He had beenaroused by the Inspector's shouting, and was evidently greatlyperturbed. His usual dignified air was marred by a patent alarm.</p> 
<p>　　"What's all this?" he exclaimed, as he halted and stareddoubtfully on the scene before him.</p> 
<p>　　Burke, in a moment like this, was no respecter of persons, forall his judicious attentions on other occasions to those whoseinfluence might serve him well for benefits received.</p> 
<p>　　"You can see for yourself," he said grimly to the dumfoundedmagnate. Then, he fixed sinister eyes on the son. "So," he wenton, with somber menace in his voice, "you did it, young man." Henodded toward the detective. "Well, Cassidy, you can take 'emboth down-town.... That's all."The command aroused Dick to remonstrance against such indignitytoward the woman whom he loved.</p> 
<p>　　"Not her!" he cried, imploringly. "You don't want her,Inspector! This is all wrong!"Now, at last, Mary interposed with a new spirit. She hadregained, in some measure at least, her poise. She was speakingagain with that mental clarity which was distinctive in her.</p> 
<p>　　"Dick," she advised quietly, but with underlying urgency in hergently spoken words, "don't talk, please."Burke laughed harshly.</p> 
<p>　　"What do you expect?" he inquired truculently. "As a matter offact, the thing's simple enough, young man. Either you killedGriggs, or she did."The Inspector, with his charge, made a careless gesture towardthe corpse of the murdered stool-pigeon. For the first time,Edward Gilder, as his glance unconsciously followed the officer'smovement, looked and saw the ghastly inanimate heap of flesh andbone that had once been a man. He fairly reeled at the gruesomespectacle, then fumbled with an outstretched hand as he movedstumblingly until he laid hold on a chair, into which he sankhelplessly. It suddenly smote upon his consciousness that hefelt very old and broken. He marveled dully over thesensation--it was wholly new to him. Then, soon, from a long wayoff, he heard the strident voice of the Inspector remorselesslycontinuing in the vile, the impossible accusation.... And thatgrotesque accusation was hurled against his only son--the boywhom he so loved. The thing was monstrous, a thing incredible.</p> 
<p>　　This whole seeming was no more than a chimera of the night, aphantom of bad dreams, with no truth under it.... Yet, the sternvoice of the official came with a strange semblance of reality.</p> 
<p>　　"Either you killed him," the voice repeated gratingly, "or shedid. Well, then, young man, did she kill him?""Good God, no!" Dick shouted, aghast.</p> 
<p>　　"Then, it was you!" Such was the Inspector's summary of the case.</p> 
<p>　　Mary's words came frantically. Once again, she was becomedesperate over the course of events in this night of fearfulhappenings.</p> 
<p>　　"No, no! He didn't!"Burke's rasping voice reiterated the accusation with a certaincomplacency in the inevitability of the dilemma.</p> 
<p>　　"One of you killed Griggs. Which one of you did it?" He scowledat Dick. "Did she kill him?"Again, the husband's cry came with the fierceness of despair overthe fate of the woman.</p> 
<p>　　"I told you, no!"The Inspector, always savagely impressive now in voice and lookand gesture, faced the girl with saturnine persistence.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, then," he blustered, "did he kill him?"The nod of his head was toward Dick. Then, as she remainedsilent: "I'm talking to you!" he snapped. "Did he kill him?"The reply came with a soft distinctness that was like a crash ofdestiny.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes."Dick turned to his wife in reproachful amazement.</p> 
<p>　　"Mary!" he cried, incredulously. This betrayal was somethinginconceivable from her, since he believed that now at last heknew her heart.</p> 
<p>　　Burke, however, as usual, paid no heed to the niceties ofsentiment. They had small place in his concerns as an officialof police. His sole ambition just now was to fix the crimedefinitely on the perpetrator.</p> 
<p>　　"You'll swear he killed him?" he asked, briskly, well contentwith this concrete result of the entanglement.</p> 
<p>　　Mary subtly evaded the question, while seeming to giveunqualified assent.</p> 
<p>　　"Why not?" she responded listlessly.</p> 
<p>　　At this intolerable assertion as he deemed it, Edward Gilder wasreanimated. He sat rigidly erect in his, chair. In thatfrightful moment, it came to him anew that here was in verity thelast detail in a consummate scheme by this woman for revengeagainst himself.</p> 
<p>　　"God!" he cried, despairingly. "And that's your vengeance!"Mary heard, and understood. There came an inscrutable smile onher curving lips, but there was no satisfaction in that smile, asof one who realized the fruition of long-cherished schemes ofretribution. Instead, there was only an infinite sadness, whileshe spoke very gently.</p> 
<p>　　"I don't want vengeance--now!" she said.</p> 
<p>　　"But they'll try my boy for murder," the magnate remonstrated,distraught.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, no, they can't!" came the rejoinder. And now, once again,there was a hint of the quizzical creeping in the smile. "No,they can't!" she repeated firmly, and there was profound reliefin her tones since at last her ingenuity had found a way out ofthis outrageous situation thrust on her and on her husband.</p> 
<p>　　Burke glared at the speaker in a rage that was abruptly grownsuspicious in some vague way.</p> 
<p>　　"What's the reason we can't?" he stormed.</p> 
<p>　　Mary sprang to her feet. She was radiant with a new serenity,now that her quick-wittedness had discovered a method forbaffling the mesh of evidence that had been woven about her andDick through no fault of their own. Her eyes were glowing witheven more than their usual lusters. Her voice came softlymodulated, almost mocking.</p> 
<p>　　"Because you couldn't convict him," she said succinctly. Acontented smile bent the red graces of her lips.</p> 
<p>　　Burke sneered an indignation that was, nevertheless, somewhatfearful of what might lie behind the woman's assurance.</p> 
<p>　　"What's the reason?" he demanded, scornfully. "There's thebody." He pointed to the rigid form of the dead man, lying thereso very near them. "And the gun was found on him. And then,you're willing to swear that he killed him.... Well, I guesswe'll convict him, all right. Why not?"Mary's answer was given quietly, but, none the less, with anassurance that could not be gainsaid.</p> 
<p>　　"Because," she said, "my husband merely killed a burglar." Inher turn, she pointed toward the body of the dead man. "Thatman," she continued evenly, "was the burglar. You know that! Myhusband shot him in defense of his home!" There was a briefsilence. Then, she added, with a wonderful mildness in the musicof her voice. "And so, Inspector, as you know of course, he waswithin the law!"</p>
