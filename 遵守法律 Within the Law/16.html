<p>　　"A man to see you, sir," he said.</p> 
<p>　　Gilder made a gesture of irritation, as he sank into the chair athis desk.</p> 
<p>　　"I can't see any one to-night, Thomas," he exclaimed, sharply.</p> 
<p>　　"But he said it was most important, sir," the servant went on.</p> 
<p>　　He held out the tray insistently.</p> 
<p>　　The master took the card grudgingly. As his eyes caught thename, his expression changed slightly.</p> 
<p>　　"Very well," he said, "show him up." His glance met thewondering gaze of his son.</p> 
<p>　　"It's Burke," he explained.</p> 
<p>　　"What on earth can he want--at this time of night?" Dickexclaimed.</p> 
<p>　　The father smiled grimly.</p> 
<p>　　"You may as well get used to visits from the police." There wassomething ghastly in the effort toward playfulness.</p> 
<p>　　A moment later, Inspector Burke entered the room.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, you're here, too," he said, as his eyes fell on Dick.</p> 
<p>　　"That's good. I wanted to see you, too."Inspector Burke was, in fact, much concerned over the situationthat had developed. He was a man of undoubted ability, and hetook a keen professional pride in his work. He possessed thefaults of his class, was not too scrupulous where he saw a safeopportunity to make a snug sum of money through the employment ofhis official authority, was ready to buckle to those whoseinfluence could help or hinder his ambition. But, in spite ofthese ordinary defects, he was fond of his work and wishful toexcel in it. Thus, Mary Turner had come to be a thorn in hisside. She flouted his authority and sustained her incredibleeffrontery by a restraining order from the court. The thing wasoutrageous to him, and he set himself to match her cunning. Thefact that she had involved Dick Gilder within her toils made himthe more anxious to overcome her in the strife of resourcesbetween them. After much studying, he had at last plannedsomething that, while it would not directly touch Mary herself,would at least serve to intimidate her, and as well make furtheraction easier against her. It was in pursuit of this scheme thathe now came to Gilder's house, and the presence of the young manabruptly gave him another idea that might benefit him well. So,he disregarded Gilder's greeting, and went on speaking to theson.</p> 
<p>　　"She's skipped!" he said, triumphantly.</p> 
<p>　　Dick made a step forward. His eyes flashed, and there was angerin his voice as he replied:</p> 
<p>　　"I don't believe it."The Inspector smiled, unperturbed.</p> 
<p>　　"She left this morning for Chicago," he said, lying with a mannerthat long habit rendered altogether convincing. "I told youshe'd go." He turned to the father, and spoke with an air ofboastful good nature. "Now, all you have to do is to get this boyout of the scrape and you'll be all right.""If we only could!" The cry came with deepest earnestness fromthe lips of Gilder, but there was little hope in his voice.</p> 
<p>　　The Inspector, however, was confident of success, and his tonesrang cheerfully as he answered:</p> 
<p>　　"I guess we can find a way to have the marriage annulled, orwhatever they do to marriages that don't take."The brutal assurance of the man in thus referring to things thatwere sacred, moved Dick to wrath.</p> 
<p>　　"Don't you interfere," he said. His words were spoken softly,but tensely.</p> 
<p>　　Nevertheless, Burke held to the topic, but an indefinable changein his manner rendered it less offensive to the young man.</p> 
<p>　　"Interfere! Huh!" he ejaculated, grinning broadly. "Why, that'swhat I'm paid to do. Listen to me, son. The minute you beginmixing up with crooks, you ain't in a position to give orders toany one. The crooks have got no rights in the eyes of thepolice. Just remember that."The Inspector spoke the simple truth as he knew it from years ofexperience. The theory of the law is that a presumption ofinnocence exists until the accused is proven guilty. But thepolice are out of sympathy with such finical methods. With them,the crook is presumed guilty at the outset of whatever may becharged against him. If need be, there will be proof a-plentyagainst him--of the sort that the underworld knows to its sorrow.</p> 
<p>　　But Dick was not listening. His thoughts were again wholly withthe woman he loved, who, as the Inspector declared, had fled fromhim.</p> 
<p>　　"Where's she gone in Chicago?"Burke answered in his usual gruff fashion, but with a note ofkindliness that was not without its effect on Dick.</p> 
<p>　　"I'm no mind-reader," he said. "But she's a swell little girl,all right. I've got to hand it to her for that. So, she'llprobably stop at the Blackstone--that is, until the Chicagopolice are tipped off that she is in town."Of a sudden, the face of the young man took on a totallydifferent expression. Where before had been anger, now was avivid eagerness. He went close to the Inspector, and spoke withintense seriousness.</p> 
<p>　　"Burke," he said, pleadingly, "give me a chance. I'll leave forChicago in the morning. Give me twenty-four hours start beforeyou begin hounding her."The Inspector regarded the speaker searchingly. His heavy facewas drawn in an expression of apparent doubt. Abruptly, then, hesmiled acquiescence.</p> 
<p>　　"Seems reasonable," he admitted.</p> 
<p>　　But the father strode to his son.</p> 
<p>　　"No, no, Dick," he cried. "You shall not go! You shall not go!"Burke, however, shook his head in remonstrance against Gilder'splea. His huge voice came booming, weightily impressive.</p> 
<p>　　"Why not?" he questioned. "It's a fair gamble. And, besides, Ilike the boy's nerve."Dick seized on the admission eagerly.</p> 
<p>　　"And you'll agree?" he cried.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes, I'll agree," the Inspector answered.</p> 
<p>　　"Thank you," Dick said quietly.</p> 
<p>　　But the father was not content. On the contrary, he went towardthe two hurriedly, with a gesture of reproval.</p> 
<p>　　"You shall not go, Dick," he declared, imperiously.</p> 
<p>　　The Inspector shot a word of warning to Gilder in an aside thatDick could not hear.</p> 
<p>　　"Keep still," he replied. "It's all right."Dick went on speaking with a seriousness suited to the magnitudeof his interests.</p> 
<p>　　"You give me your word, Inspector," he said, "that you won'tnotify the police in Chicago until I've been there twenty-fourhours?""You're on," Burke replied genially. "They won't get a whisperout of me until the time is up." He swung about to face thefather, and there was a complete change in his manner. "Now,then, Mr. Gilder," he said briskly, "I want to talk to you aboutanother little matter----"Dick caught the suggestion, and interrupted quickly.</p> 
<p>　　"Then I'll go." He smiled rather wanly at his father. "Youknow, Dad, I'm sorry, but I've got to do what I think is theright thing."Burke helped to save the situation from the growing tenseness.</p> 
<p>　　"Sure," he cried heartily; "sure you have. That's the best anyof us can do." He watched keenly as the young man went out ofthe room. It was not until the door was closed after Dick thathe spoke. Then he dropped to a seat on the couch, and proceededto make his confidences to the magnate.</p> 
<p>　　"He'll go to Chicago in the morning, you think, don't you?""Certainly," Gilder answered. "But I don't like it."Burke slapped his leg with an enthusiasm that might have broken aweaker member.</p> 
<p>　　"Best thing that could have happened!" he vociferated. And then,as Gilder regarded him in astonishment, he added, chuckling: "Yousee, he won't find her there.""Why do you think that?" Gilder demanded, greatly puzzled.</p> 
<p>　　Burke permitted himself the luxury of laughing appreciatively amoment more before making his exclamation. Then he said quietly:</p> 
<p>　　"Because she didn't go there.""Where did she go, then?" Gilder queried wholly at a loss.</p> 
<p>　　Once again the officer chuckled. It was evident that he was wellpleased with his own ingenuity.</p> 
<p>　　"Nowhere yet," he said at last. "But, just about the time he'sstarting for the West I'll have her down at Headquarters.</p> 
<p>　　Demarest will have her indicted before noon. She'll go for trialin the afternoon. And to-morrow night she'll be sleeping up theriver.... That's where she is going."Gilder stood motionless for a moment. After all, he was anordinary citizen, quite unfamiliar with the recondite methodsfamiliar to the police.</p> 
<p>　　"But," he said, wonderingly, "you can't do that."The Inspector laughed, a laugh of disingenuous amusement, for heunderstood perfectly the lack of comprehension on the part of hishearer.</p> 
<p>　　"Well," he said, and his voice sank into a modest rumble that wasnone the less still thunderous. "Perhaps I can't!" And then hebeamed broadly, his whole face smiling blandly on the man whodoubted his power. "Perhaps I can't," he repeated. Then thechuckle came again, and he added emphatically: "But I will!"Suddenly, his heavy face grew hard. His alert eyes shonefiercely, with a flash of fire that was known to every patrolmanwho had ever reported to the desk when he was lieutenant. Hisheavy jaw shot forward aggressively as he spoke.</p> 
<p>　　"Think I'm going to let that girl make a joke of the PoliceDepartment? Why, I'm here to get her--to stop her anyhow. Hergang is going to break into your house to-night.""What?" Gilder demanded. "You mean, she's coming here as athief?""Not exactly," Inspector Burke confessed, "but her pals arecoming to try to pull off something right here. She wouldn'tcome, not if I know her. She's too clever for that. Why, if sheknew what Garson was planning to do, she'd stop him."The Inspector paused suddenly. For a long minute his face wasseamed with thought. Then, he smote his thigh with a blow strongenough to kill an ox. His face was radiant.</p> 
<p>　　"By God! I've got her!" he cried. The inspiration for which hehad longed was his at last. He went to the desk where thetelephone was, and took up the receiver.</p> 
<p>　　"Give me 3100 Spring," he said. As he waited for the connectionhe smiled widely on the astonished Gilder. " 'Tain't too late,"he said joyously. "I must have been losing my mind not to havethought of it before." The impact of sounds on his ear from thereceiver set him to attention.</p> 
<p>　　"Headquarters?" he called. "Inspector Burke speaking. Who's inmy office? I want him quick." He smiled as he listened, and hespoke again to Gilder. "It's Smith, the best man I have. That'sluck, if you ask me." Then again he spoke into the mouthpiece ofthe telephone.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, Ed, send some one up to that Turner woman. You have theaddress. Just see that she is tipped off, that Joe Garson andsome pals are going to break into Edward Gilder's house to-night.</p> 
<p>　　Get some stool-pigeon to hand her the information. You'd betterget to work damned quick. Understand?"The Inspector pulled out that watch of which Aggie Lynch hadspoken so avariciously, and glanced at it, then went on speaking:</p> 
<p>　　"It's ten-thirty now. She went to the Lyric Theater with somewoman. Get her as she leaves, or find her back at her own placelater. You'll have to hustle, anyhow. That's all!"The Inspector hung up the receiver and faced his host with acontented smile.</p> 
<p>　　"What good will all that do?" Gilder demanded, impatiently.</p> 
<p>　　Burke explained with a satisfaction natural to one who haddevised something ingenious and adequate. This inspiration filledhim with delight. At last he was sure of catching Mary Turnerherself in his toils.</p> 
<p>　　"She'll come to stop 'em," he said. "When we get the rest of thegang, we'll grab her, too. Why, I almost forgot her, thinkingabout Garson. Mr. Gilder, you would hardly believe it, butthere's scarcely been a real bit of forgery worth while done inthis country for the last twenty years, that Garson hasn't beenmixed up in. We've never once got him right in all that time."The Inspector paused to chuckle. "Crooks are funny," heexplained with obvious contentment. "Clever as he is, Garson letGriggs talk him into a second-story job, and now we'll get himwith the goods.... Just call your man for a minute, will you, Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Gilder?"Gilder pressed the electric button on his desk. At the samemoment, through the octagonal window came a blinding flash oflight that rested for seconds, then vanished. Burke, by no meansa nervous man, nevertheless was startled by the mysteriousradiance.</p> 
<p>　　"What's that?" he demanded, sharply.</p> 
<p>　　"It's the flashlight from the Metropolitan Tower," Gilderexplained with a smile over the policeman's perturbation. "Itswings around this way about every fifteen minutes. The servantforgot to draw the curtains." As he spoke, he went to thewindow, and pulled the heavy draperies close. "It won't botherus again."The entrance of the butler brought the Inspector's thoughts backto the matter in hand.</p> 
<p>　　"My man," he said, authoritatively, "I want you to go up to theroof and open the scuttle. You'll find some men waiting upthere. Bring 'em down here."The servant's usually impassive face showed astonishment, notunmixed with dismay, and he looked doubtfully toward his master,who nodded reassuringly.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, they won't hurt you," the Inspector declared, as he noticedthe man's hesitation. "They're police officers. You get 'em downhere, and then you go to bed and stay there till morning.</p> 
<p>　　Understand?"Again, the butler looked at his master for guidance in this verypeculiar affair, as he deemed it. Receiving another nod, hesaid:</p> 
<p>　　"Very well, sir." He regarded the Inspector with a certainhelpless indignation over this disturbance of the natural order,and left the room.</p> 
<p>　　Gilder himself was puzzled over the situation, which was by nomeans clear to him.</p> 
<p>　　"How do you know they're going to break into the house to-night?"he demanded of Burke; "or do you only think they're going tobreak into the house?""I know they are." The Inspector's harsh voice brought out thewords boastfully. "I fixed it.""You did!" There was wonder in the magnate's exclamation.</p> 
<p>　　"Sure," Burke declared complacently, "did it through astool-pigeon.""Oh, an informer," Gilder interrupted, a little doubtfully.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes," Burke agreed. "Stool-pigeon is the police name for him.</p> 
<p>　　Really, he's the vilest thing that crawls.""But, if you think that," Gilder expostulated, "why do you haveanything to do with that sort of person?""Because it's good business," the Inspector replied. "We knowhe's a spy and a traitor, and that every time he comes near us weought to use a disinfectant. But we deal with him just thesame--because we have to. Now, the stool-pigeon in this trick isa swell English crook. He went to Garson yesterday with a schemeto rob your house. He tried out Mary Turner, too, but shewouldn't stand for it--said it would break the law, which iscontrary to her principles. She told Garson to leave it alone.</p> 
<p>　　But he met Griggs afterward without her knowing anything aboutit, and then he agreed to pull it off. Griggs got word to methat it's coming off to-night. And so, you see, Mr. Gilder,that's how I know. Do you get me?""I see," Gilder admitted without any enthusiasm. As a matter offact, he felt somewhat offended that his house should be thussummarily seized as a trap for criminals.</p> 
<p>　　"But why do you have your men come down over the roof?" heinquired curiously.</p> 
<p>　　"It wasn't safe to bring them in the front way," was theInspector's prompt reply. "It's a cinch the house is beingwatched. I wish you would let me have your latch-key. I want tocome back, and make this collar myself."The owner of the house obediently took the desired key from hisring and gave it to the Inspector with a shrug of resignation.</p> 
<p>　　"But, why not stay, now that you are here?" he asked.</p> 
<p>　　"Huh!" Burke retorted. "Suppose some of them saw me come in?</p> 
<p>　　There wouldn't be anything doing until after they see me go outagain."The hall door opened and the butler reentered the room. Behindhim came Cassidy and two other detectives in plain clothes. At aword from his master, the disturbed Thomas withdrew with theintention of obeying the Inspector's directions that he shouldretire to bed and stay there, carefully avoiding whateverpossibilities of peril there might be in the situation so foreignto his ideals of propriety.</p> 
<p>　　"Now," Burke went on briskly, as the door closed behind theservant, "where could these men stay out of sight until they'reneeded?"There followed a little discussion which ended in the selectionof a store-room at the end of the passage on the ground floor, onwhich one of the library doors opened.</p> 
<p>　　"You see," Burke explained to Gilder, when this matter had beensettled to his satisfaction, and while Cassidy and the otherdetectives were out of the library on a tour of inspection, "youmust have things right, when it comes to catching crooks on aframe-up like this. I had these men come to Number Twenty-six onthe other street, then round the block on the roofs."Gilder nodded appreciation which was not actually sincere. Itseemed to him that such elaborate manoeuvering was, in truth,rather absurd.</p> 
<p>　　"And now, Mr. Gilder," the Inspector said energetically, "I'mgoing to give you the same tip I gave your man. Go to bed, andstay there.""But the boy," Gilder protested. "What about him? He's the onething of importance to me.""If he says anything more about going to Chicago--just you lethim go, that's all! It's the best place for him for the next fewdays. I'll get in touch with you in the morning and let you knowthen how things are coming out."Gilder sighed resignedly. His heavy face was lined with anxiety.</p> 
<p>　　There was a hesitation in his manner of speech that was whollyunlike its usual quick decisiveness.</p> 
<p>　　"I don't like this sort of thing," he said, doubtfully. "I letyou go ahead because I can't suggest any alternative, but I don'tlike it, not at all. It seems to me that other methods might beemployed with excellent results without the element of treacherywhich seems to involve me as well as you in our efforts toovercome this woman."Burke, however, had no qualms as to such plotting.</p> 
<p>　　"You must have crooked ways to catch crooks, believe me," he saidcheerfully. "It's the easiest and quickest way out of thetrouble for us, and the easiest and quickest way into trouble forthem."The return of the detectives caused him to break off, and he gavehis attention to the final arrangements of his men.</p> 
<p>　　"You're in charge here," he said to Cassidy, "and I hold youresponsible. Now, listen to this, and get it." His coarse voicecame with a grating note of command. "I'm coming back to get thisbunch myself, and I'll call you when you're wanted. You'll waitin the store-room out there and don't make a move till you hearfrom me, unless by any chance things go wrong and you get a callfrom Griggs. You know who he is. He's got a whistle, and he'lluse it if necessary.... Got that straight?" And, when Cassidyhad declared an entire understanding of the directions given, heconcluded concisely. "On your way, then!"As the men left the room, he turned again to Gilder.</p> 
<p>　　"Just one thing more," he said. "I'll have to have your help alittle longer. After I've gone, I want you to stay up for ahalf-hour anyhow, with the lights burning. Do you see? I want tobe sure to give the Turner woman time to get here while that gangis at work. Your keeping on the lights will hold them back, forthey won't come in till the house is dark, so, in half an houryou can get off the job, switch off the lights and go to bed andstay there--just as I told you before." Then Inspector Burke,having in mind the great distress of the man over the unfortunateentanglement of his son, was at pains to offer a reassuring word.</p> 
<p>　　"Don't worry about the boy," he said, with grave kindliness.</p> 
<p>　　"We'll get him out of this scrape all right." And with theassertion he bustled out, leaving the unhappy father to miserableforebodings.</p>
