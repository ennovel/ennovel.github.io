But the result must have been the same had he takenyears of thought. Between him and her as the victim of the law,there could be no hesitation for choice. Indeed, just now, hehad no heed to his own fate. The prime necessity was to saveher, Mary, from the toils of the law that were closing aroundher. For himself, in the days to come, there would be a ghastlydread, but there would never be regret over the cost of savingher. Perhaps, some other he might have let suffer in hisstead--not her! Even, had he been innocent, and she guilty of thecrime, he would still have taken the burden of it on his ownshoulders. He had saved her from the waters--he would save heruntil the end, as far as the power in him might lie. It was thusthat, with the primitive directness of his reverential love forthe girl, he counted no sacrifice too great in her behalf. JoeGarson was not a good man, at the world esteems goodness. On thecontrary, he was distinctly an evil one, a menace to the societyon which he preyed constantly. But his good qualities, if few,were of the strongest fiber, rooted in the deeps of him. Heloathed treachery. His one guiltiness in this respect had been,curiously enough, toward Mary herself, in the scheme of theburglary, which she had forbidden. But, in the last analysis,here his deceit had been designed to bring affluence to her. Itwas his abhorrence of treachery among pals that had driven him tothe murder of the stool-pigeon in a fit of ungovernable passion.</p> 
<p>　　He might have stayed his hand then, but for the gusty rage thatswept him on to the crime. None the less, had he spared the man,his hatred of the betrayer would have been the same.... And theother virtue of Joe Garson was the complement of this--his ownloyalty, a loyalty that made him forget self utterly where heloved. The one woman who had ever filled his heart was Mary, andfor her his life were not too much to give.</p> 
<p>　　The suddenness of it all held Mary voiceless for long seconds.</p> 
<p>　　She was frozen with horror of the event.</p> 
<p>　　When, at last, words came, they were a frantic prayer of protest.</p> 
<p>　　"No, Joe! No! Don't talk--don't talk!"Burke, immensely gratified, went nimbly to his chair, and thencesurveyed the agitated group with grisly pleasure.</p> 
<p>　　"Joe has talked," he said, significantly.</p> 
<p>　　Mary, shaken as she was by the fact of Garson's confession,nevertheless retained her presence of mind sufficiently to resistwith all her strength.</p> 
<p>　　"He did it to protect me," she stated, earnestly.</p> 
<p>　　The Inspector disdained such futile argument. As the doormanappeared in answer to the buzzer, he directed that thestenographer be summoned at once.</p> 
<p>　　"We'll have the confession in due form," he remarked, gazingpleasedly on the three before him.</p> 
<p>　　"He's not going to confess," Mary insisted, with spirit.</p> 
<p>　　But Burke was not in the least impressed. He disregarded hercompletely, and spoke mechanically to Garson the formal warningrequired by the law.</p> 
<p>　　"You are hereby cautioned that anything you say may be usedagainst you." Then, as the stenographer entered, he went on withlively interest. "Now, Joe!"Yet once again, Mary protested, a little wildly.</p> 
<p>　　"Don't speak, Joe! Don't say a word till we can get a lawyer foryou!"The man met her pleading eyes steadily, and shook his head inrefusal.</p> 
<p>　　"It's no use, my girl," Burke broke in, harshly. "I told you I'dget you. I'm going to try you and Garson, and the whole gang formurder--yes, every one of you.... And you, Gilder," he continued,lowering on the young man who had defied him so obstinately,"you'll go to the House of Detention as a material witness." Heturned his gaze to Garson again, and spoke authoritatively: "Comeon now, Joe!"Garson went a step toward the desk, and spoke decisively.</p> 
<p>　　"If I come through, you'll let her go--and him?" he added as anafterthought, with a nod toward Dick Gilder.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, Joe, don't!" Mary cried, bitterly. "We'll spend everydollar we can raise to save you!""Now, it's no use," the Inspector complained. "You're onlywasting time. He's said that he did it. That's all there is toit. Now that we're sure he's our man, he hasn't got a chance inthe world.""Well, how about it?" Garson demanded, savagely. "Do they goclear, if I come through?""We'll get the best lawyers in the country," Mary persisted,desperately. "We'll save you, Joe--we'll save you!"Garson regarded the distraught girl with wistful eyes. But therewas no trace of yielding in his voice as he replied, though hespoke very sorrowfully.</p> 
<p>　　"No, you can't help me," he said, simply. "My time has come,Mary.... And I can save you a lot of trouble.""He's right there," Burke ejaculated. "We've got him cold. So,what's the use of dragging you two into it?""Then, they go clear?" Garson exclaimed, eagerly. "They ain'teven to be called as witnesses?"Burke nodded assent.</p> 
<p>　　"You're on!" he agreed.</p> 
<p>　　"Then, here goes!" Garson cried; and he looked expectantly towardthe stenographer.</p> 
<p>　　The strain of it all was sapping the will of the girl, who sawthe man she so greatly esteemed for his service to her and hisdevotion about to condemn himself to death. She grewhalf-hysterical. Her words came confusedly:</p> 
<p>　　"No, Joe! No, no, no!"Again, Garson shook his head in absolute refusal of her plea.</p> 
<p>　　"There's no other way out," he declared, wearily. "I'm goingthrough with it." He straightened a little, and again looked atthe stenographer. His voice came quietly, without anytremulousnesss.</p> 
<p>　　"My name is Joe Garson.""Alias?" Burke suggested.</p> 
<p>　　"Alias nothing!" came the sharp retort. "Garson's my monaker. Ishot English Eddie, because he was a skunk, and a stool-pigeon,and he got just what was coming to him." Vituperation beyond themere words beat in his voice now.</p> 
<p>　　Burke twisted uneasily in his chair.</p> 
<p>　　"Now, now!" he objected, severely. "We can't take a confessionlike that."Garson shook his head--spoke with fiercer hatred. "because he wasa skunk, and a stool-pigeon," he repeated. "Have you got it?"And then, as the stenographer nodded assent, he went on, lessviolently: "I croaked him just as he was going to call the bullswith a police-whistle. I used a gun with smokeless powder. Ithad a Maxim silencer on it, so that it didn't make any noise."Garson paused, and the set despair of his features lightened alittle. Into his voice came a tone of exultation indescribablyghastly. It was born of the eternal egotism of the criminal,fattening vanity in gloating over his ingenuity for evil.</p> 
<p>　　Garson, despite his two great virtues, had the vices of hisclass. Now, he stared at Burke with a quizzical grin crookinghis lips.</p> 
<p>　　"Say," he exclaimed, "I'll bet it's the first time a guy was evercroaked with one of them things! Ain't it?"The Inspector nodded affirmation. There was sincere admirationin his expression, for he was ready at all times to respect thepersonal abilities of the criminals against whom he wagedrelentless war.</p> 
<p>　　"That's right, Joe!" he said, with perceptible enthusiasm.</p> 
<p>　　"Some class to that, eh?" Garson demanded, still with thatgruesome air of boasting. "I got the gun, and the Maxim-silencerthing, off a fence in Boston," he explained. "Say, that thingcost me sixty dollars, and it's worth every cent of the money....</p> 
<p>　　Why, they'll remember me as the first to spring one of themthings, won't they?""They sure will, Joe!" the Inspector conceded.</p> 
<p>　　"Nobody knew I had it," Garson continued, dropping his braggartmanner abruptly.</p> 
<p>　　At the words, Mary started, and her lips moved as if she wereabout to speak.</p> 
<p>　　Garson, intent on her always, though he seemed to look only atBurke, observed the effect on her, and repeated his wordsswiftly, with a warning emphasis that gave the girl pause.</p> 
<p>　　"Nobody knew I had it--nobody in the world!" he declared. "Andnobody had anything to do with the killing but me."Burke put a question that was troubling him much, concerning themotive that lay behind the shooting of Griggs.</p> 
<p>　　"Was there any bad feeling between you and Eddie Griggs?"Garson's reply was explicit.</p> 
<p>　　"Never till that very minute. Then, I learned the truth aboutwhat he'd framed up with you." The speaker's voice reverted toits former fierceness in recollection of the treachery of onewhom he had trusted.</p> 
<p>　　"He was a stool-pigeon, and I hated his guts! That's all," heconcluded, with brutal candor.</p> 
<p>　　The Inspector moved restlessly in his chair. He had onlydetestation for the slain man, yet there was something morbidlydistasteful in the thought that he himself had contrived thesituation which had resulted in the murder of his confederate.</p> 
<p>　　It was only by an effort that he shook off the vague feeling ofguilt.</p> 
<p>　　"Nothing else to say?" he inquired.</p> 
<p>　　Garson reflected for a few seconds, then made a gesture ofnegation.</p> 
<p>　　"Nothing else," he declared. "I croaked him, and I'm glad I doneit. He was a skunk. That's all, and it's enough. And it's alltrue, so help me God!"The Inspector nodded dismissal to the stenographer, with an airof relief.</p> 
<p>　　"That's all, Williams," he said, heavily. "He'll sign it as soonas you've transcribed the notes."Then, as the stenographer left the room, Burke turned his gaze onthe woman, who stood there in a posture of complete dejection,her white, anguished face downcast. There was triumph in theInspector's voice as he addressed her, for his professional pridewas full-fed by this victory over his foes. But there was, too,an undertone of a feeling softer than pride, more generous,something akin to real commiseration for this unhappy girl whodrooped before him, suffering so poignantly in the knowledge ofthe fate that awaited the man who had saved her, who had lovedher so unselfishly"Young woman," Burke said briskly, "it's just like I told you.</p> 
<p>　　You can't beat the law. Garson thought he could--and now----!"He broke off, with a wave of his hand toward the man who had justsentenced himself to death in the electric-chair.</p> 
<p>　　"That's right," Garson agreed, with somber intensity. His eyeswere grown clouded again now, and his voice dragged leaden.</p> 
<p>　　"That's right, Mary," he repeated dully, after a little pause.</p> 
<p>　　"You can't beat the law!"There followed a period of silence, in which great emotions werevibrant from heart to heart. Garson was thinking of Mary, and,with the thought, into his misery crept a little comfort. Atleast, she would go free. That had been in the bargain withBurke. And there was the boy, too. His eyes shot a single swiftglance toward Dick Gilder, and his satisfaction increased as henoted the alert poise of the young man's body, the strainedexpression of the strong face, the gaze of absorbed yearning withwhich he regarded Mary. There could be no doubt concerning thedepth of the lad's love for the girl. Moreover, there were manlyqualities in him to work out all things needful for herprotection through life. Already, he had proved his devotion,and that abundantly, his unswerving fidelity to her, and theforce within him that made these worthy in some measure of her.</p> 
<p>　　Garson felt no least pang of jealousy. Though he loved the womanwith the single love of his life, he had never, somehow, hopedaught for himself. There was even something almost of thepaternal in the purity of his love, as if, indeed, by the fact ofrestoring her to life he had taken on himself the responsibilityof a parent. He knew that the boy worshiped her, would do hisbest for her, that this best would suffice for her happiness intime. Garson, with the instinct of love, guessed that Mary hadin truth given her heart all unaware to the husband whom she hadfirst lured only for the lust of revenge. Garson nodded his headin a melancholy satisfaction. His life was done: hers was justbeginning, now.... But she would remember him --oh, yes, always!</p> 
<p>　　Mary was loyal.</p> 
<p>　　The man checked the trend of his thoughts by a mighty effort ofwill. He must not grow maudlin here. He spoke again to Mary,with a certain dignity.</p> 
<p>　　"No, you can't beat the law!" He hesitated a little, then wenton, with a certain curious embarrassment. "And this same old lawsays a woman must stick to her man."The girl's eyes met his with passionate sorrow in their mistydeeps. Garson gave a significant glance toward Dick Gilder, thenhis gaze returned to her. There was a smoldering despair in thatlook. There were, as well, an entreaty and a command.</p> 
<p>　　"So," he went on, "you must go along with him, Mary.. . .</p> 
<p>　　Won't you? It's the best thing to do."The girl could not answer. There was a clutch on her throat justthen, which would not relax at the call of her will.</p> 
<p>　　The tension of a moment grew, became pervasive. Burke, accustomedas he was to scenes of dramatic violence, now experienced analtogether unfamiliar thrill. As for Garson, once again the surgeof feeling threatened to overwhelm his self-control. He must notbreak down! For Mary's sake, he must show himself stoical, quiteundisturbed in this supreme hour.</p> 
<p>　　Of a sudden, an inspiration came to him, a means to snap thetension, to create a diversion wholly efficacious. He would turnto his boasting again, would call upon his vanity, which he knewwell as his chief foible, and make it serve as the foil againsthis love. He strove manfully to throw off the softer mood. In ameasure, at least, he won the fight--though always, under therush of this vaunting, there throbbed the anguish of his heart.</p> 
<p>　　"You want to cut out worrying about me," he counseled, bravely.</p> 
<p>　　"Why, I ain't worrying any, myself--not a little bit! You see,it's something new I've pulled off. Nobody ever put overanything like it before."He faced Burke with a grin of gloating again.</p> 
<p>　　"I'll bet there'll be a lot of stuff in the newspapers aboutthis, and my picture, too, in most of 'em! What?"The man's manner imposed on Burke, though Mary felt the tormentthat his vainglorying was meant to mask.</p> 
<p>　　"Say," Garson continued to the Inspector, "if the reporters wantany pictures of me, could I have some new ones taken? The oneyou've got of me in the Gallery is over ten years old. I'vetaken off my beard since then. Can I have a new one?" He putthe question with an eagerness that seemed all sincere.</p> 
<p>　　Burke answered with a fine feeling of generosity.</p> 
<p>　　"Sure, you can, Joe! I'll send you up to the Gallery right now.""Immense!" Garson cried, boisterously. He moved toward DickGilder, walking with a faint suggestion of swagger to cover thenervous tremor that had seized him.</p> 
<p>　　"So long, young fellow!" he exclaimed, and held out his hand.</p> 
<p>　　"You've been on the square, and I guess you always will be."Dick had no scruple in clasping that extended hand very warmly inhis own. He had no feeling of repulsion against this man who hadcommitted a murder in his presence. Though he did not quiteunderstand the other's heart, his instinct as a lover taught himmuch, so that he pitied profoundly--and respected, too.</p> 
<p>　　"We'll do what we can for you," he said, simply.</p> 
<p>　　"That's all right," Garson replied, with such carelessness ofmanner as he could contrive. Then, at last, he turned to Mary.</p> 
<p>　　This parting must be bitter, and he braced himself with all thevigors of his will to combat the weakness that leaped from hissoul.</p> 
<p>　　As he came near, the girl could hold herself in leash no longer.</p> 
<p>　　She threw herself on his breast. Her arms wreathed about hisneck. Great sobs racked her.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, Joe, Joe!" The gasping cry was of utter despair.</p> 
<p>　　Garson's trembling hand patted the girl's shoulder very softly, acaress of infinite tenderness.</p> 
<p>　　"That's all right!" he murmured, huskily. "That's all right,Mary!" There was a short silence; and then he went on speaking,more firmly. "You know, he'll look after you."He would have said more, but he could not. It seemed to him thatthe sobs of the girl caught in his own throat. Yet, presently, hestrove once again, with every reserve of his strength; and,finally, he so far mastered himself that he could speak calmly.</p> 
<p>　　The words were uttered with a subtle renunciation that was thisman's religion.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes, he'll take care of you. Why, I'd like to see the two ofyou with about three kiddies playing round the house."He looked up over the girl's shoulder, and beckoned with his headto Dick, who came forward at the summons.</p> 
<p>　　"Take good care of her, won't you?"He disengaged himself gently from the girl's embrace, and set herwithin the arms of her husband, where she rested quietly, as ifunable to fight longer against fate's decree.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, so long!"He dared not utter another word, but turned blindly, and went,stumbling a little, toward the doorman, who had appeared inanswer to the Inspector's call.</p> 
<p>　　"To the Gallery," Burke ordered, curtly.</p> 
<p>　　Garson went on without ever a glance back.... His strength was atan end.</p> 
<p>　　* * * * *There was a long silence in the room after Garson's passing. Itwas broken, at last, by the Inspector, who got up from his chair,and advanced toward the husband and wife. In his hand, hecarried a sheet of paper, roughly scrawled. As he stopped beforethe two, and cleared his throat, Mary withdrew herself fromDick's arms, and regarded the official with brooding eyes fromout her white face. Something strange in her enemy's expressioncaught her attention, something that set new hopes alive withinher in a fashion wholly inexplicable, so that she waited with asudden, breathless eagerness.</p> 
<p>　　Burke extended the sheet of paper to the husband.</p> 
<p>　　"There's a document," he said gruffly. "It's a letter from oneHelen Morris, in which she sets forth the interesting fact thatshe pulled off a theft in the Emporium, for which your Mrs.</p> 
<p>　　Gilder here did time. You know, your father got your Mrs. Gildersent up for three years for that same job--which she didn't do!</p> 
<p>　　That's why she had such a grudge against your father, and againstthe law, too!"Burke chuckled, as the young man took the paper, wonderingly.</p> 
<p>　　"I don't know that I blame her much for that grudge, when all'ssaid and done.... You give that document to your father. It setsher right. He's a just man according to his lights, your father.</p> 
<p>　　He'll do all he can to make things right for her, now he knows."Once again, the Inspector paused to chuckle.</p> 
<p>　　"I guess she'll keep within the law from now on," he continued,contentedly, "without getting a lawyer to tell her how.... Now,you two listen. I've got to go out a minute. When I get back, Idon't want to find anybody here--not anybody! Do you get me?"He strode from the room, fearful lest further delay might involvehim in sentimental thanksgivings from one or the other, orboth--and Burke hated sentiment as something distinctlyunprofessional.</p> 
<p>　　* * * * *When the official was gone, the two stood staring mutely each atthe other through long seconds. What she read in the man's eyesset the woman's heart to beating with a new delight. A bloom ofexquisite rose grew in the pallor of her cheeks. The misty lightin the violet eyes shone more radiant, yet more softly. Thecrimson lips curved to strange tenderness.... What he read in hereyes set the husband's pulses to bounding. He opened his arms inan appeal that was a command. Mary went forward slowly, withouthesitation, in a bliss that forgot every sorrow for that blessedmoment, and cast herself on his breast.</p>
