<p>　　"Hello, Joe," Mary said graciously as the forger entered. Thenshe spoke crisply to Agnes. "And now you must get ready. Youare to be at Harris's office with this document at four o'clock,and remember that you are to let the lawyer manage everything."Aggie twisted her doll-like face into a grimace.</p> 
<p>　　"It gets my angora that I'll have to miss Pa Gilder's being ledlike a lamb to the slaughter-house." And that was the nearestthe little adventuress ever came to making a Biblical quotation.</p> 
<p>　　"Anyhow," she protested, "I don't see the use of all this monkeybusiness here. All I want is the coin." But she hurriedobediently, nevertheless, to get ready for the start.</p> 
<p>　　Garson regarded Mary quizzically.</p> 
<p>　　"It's lucky for her that she met you," he said. "She's got nomore brains than a gnat.""And brains are mighty useful things, even in our business," Maryreplied seriously; "particularly in our business.""I should say they were," Garson agreed. "You have proved that."Aggie came back, putting on her gloves, and cocking her smallhead very primly under the enormous hat that was garnished withcostliest plumes. It was thus that she consoled herself in ameasure for the business of the occasion--in lieu of cracked icefrom Tiffany's at one hundred and fifty a carat. Mary gave overthe release, and Aggie, still grumbling, deposited it in herhandbag.</p> 
<p>　　"It seems to me we're going through a lot of red tape," she saidspitefully.</p> 
<p>　　Mary, from her chair at the desk, regarded the malcontent with asmile, but her tone was crisp as she answered.</p> 
<p>　　"Listen, Agnes. The last time you tried to make a man give uppart of his money it resulted in your going to prison for twoyears."Aggie sniffed, as if such an outcome were the merest bagatelle.</p> 
<p>　　"But that way was so exciting," she urged, not at all convinced.</p> 
<p>　　"And this way is so safe," Mary rejoined, sharply. "Besides, mydear, you would not get the money. My way will. Your way wasblackmail; mine is not. Understand?""Oh, sure," Aggie replied, grimly, on her way to the door. "It'sclear as Pittsburgh." With that sarcasm directed against legalsubtleties, she tripped daintily out, an entirely ravishingvision, if somewhat garish as to raiment, and soon in the glancesof admiration that every man cast on her guileless-seemingbeauty, she forgot that she had ever been annoyed.</p> 
<p>　　Garson's comment as she departed was uttered with his accustomedbluntness.</p> 
<p>　　"Solid ivory!""She's a darling, anyway!" Mary declared, smiling. "You reallydon't half-appreciate her, Joe!""Anyhow, I appreciate that hat," was the reply, with a drychuckle.</p> 
<p>　　"Mr. Griggs," Fannie announced. There was a smile on the face ofthe maid, which was explained a minute later when, in accordancewith her mistress's order, the visitor was shown into thedrawing-room, for his presence was of an elegance soextraordinary as to attract attention anywhere--and mirth as wellfrom ribald observers.</p> 
<p>　　Meantime, Garson had explained to Mary.</p> 
<p>　　"It's English Eddie--you met him once. I wonder what he wants?</p> 
<p>　　Probably got a trick for me. We often used to work together.""Nothing without my consent," Mary warned.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, no, no, sure not!" Garson agreed.</p> 
<p>　　Further discussion was cut short by the appearance of EnglishEddie himself, a tall, handsome man in the early thirties, whopaused just within the doorway, and delivered to Mary a bow thatwas the perfection of elegance. Mary made no effort to restrainthe smile caused by the costume of Mr. Griggs. Yet, there was noviolation of the canons of good taste, except in the aggregate.</p> 
<p>　　From spats to hat, from walking coat to gloves, everything wasperfect of its kind. Only, there was an over-elaboration, sothat the ensemble was flamboyant. And the man's manners preciselyharmonized with his clothes, whereby the whole effect wasemphasized and rendered bizarre. Garson took one amazed look,and then rocked with laughter.</p> 
<p>　　Griggs regarded his former associate reproachfully for a moment,and then grinned in frank sympathy.</p> 
<p>　　"Really, Mr. Griggs, you quite overcome me," Mary said,half-apologetically.</p> 
<p>　　The visitor cast a self-satisfied glance over his garb.</p> 
<p>　　"I think it's rather neat, myself." He had some reputation inthe under-world for his manner of dressing, and he regarded thislatest achievement as his masterpiece.</p> 
<p>　　"Sure some duds!" Garson admitted, checking his merriment.</p> 
<p>　　"From your costume," Mary suggested, "one might judge that thisis purely a social call. Is it?""Well, not exactly," Griggs answered with a smile.</p> 
<p>　　"So I fancied," his hostess replied. "So, sit down, please, andtell us all about it."While she was speaking, Garson went to the various doors, andmade sure that all were shut, then he took a seat in a chair nearthat which Griggs occupied by the desk, so that the three wereclose together, and could speak softly.</p> 
<p>　　English Eddie wasted no time in getting to the point.</p> 
<p>　　"Now, look here," he said, rapidly. "I've got the greatest gamein the world.... Two years ago, a set of Gothic tapestries, worththree hundred thousand dollars and a set of Fragonard panels,worth nearly as much more, were plucked from a chateau in Franceand smuggled into this country.""I have never heard of that," Mary said, with some interest.</p> 
<p>　　"No," Griggs replied. "You naturally wouldn't, for the simplereason that it's been kept on the dead quiet.""Are them things really worth that much?" Garson exclaimed.</p> 
<p>　　"Sometimes more," Mary answered. "Morgan has a set of Gothictapestries worth half a million dollars."Garson uttered an ejaculation of disgust.</p> 
<p>　　"He pays half a million dollars for a set of rugs!" There was anote of fiercest bitterness come into his voice as hesarcastically concluded: "And they wonder at crime!"Griggs went on with his account.</p> 
<p>　　"About a month ago, the things I was telling you of were hung inthe library of a millionaire in this city." He hitched his chaira little closer to the desk, and leaned forward, lowering hisvoice almost to a whisper as he stated his plan.</p> 
<p>　　"Let's go after them. They were smuggled, mind you, and nomatter what happens, he can't squeal. What do you say?"Garson shot a piercing glance at Mary.</p> 
<p>　　"It's up to her," he said. Griggs regarded Mary eagerly, as shesat with eyes downcast. Then, after a little interval hadelapsed in silence, he spoke interrogatively:</p> 
<p>　　"Well?"Mary shook her head decisively. "It's out of our line," shedeclared.</p> 
<p>　　Griggs would have argued the matter. "I don't see any easier wayto get half a million," he said aggressively.</p> 
<p>　　Mary, however, was unimpressed.</p> 
<p>　　"If it were fifty millions, it would make no difference. It'sagainst the law.""Oh, I know all that, of course," Griggs returned impatiently.</p> 
<p>　　"But if you can----"Mary interrupted him in a tone of finality.</p> 
<p>　　"My friends and I never do anything that's illegal! Thank you forcoming to us, Mr. Griggs, but we can't go in, and there's an endof the matter.""But wait a minute," English Eddie expostulated, "you see thischap, Gilder, is----"Mary's manner changed from indifference to sudden keen interest.</p> 
<p>　　"Gilder?" she exclaimed, questioningly.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes. You know who he is," Griggs answered; "the drygoods man."Garson in his turn showed a new excitement as he bent towardMary.</p> 
<p>　　"Why, it's old Gilder, the man you----"Mary, however, had regained her self-control, for a moment rudelyshaken, and now her voice was tranquil again as she replied:</p> 
<p>　　"I know. But, just the same, it's illegal, and I won't touch it.</p> 
<p>　　That's all there is to it."Griggs was dismayed.</p> 
<p>　　"But half a million!" he exclaimed, disconsolately. "There's astake worth playing for. Think of it!" He turned pleadingly toGarson. "Half a million, Joe!"The forger repeated the words with an inflection that wasgloating.</p> 
<p>　　"Half a million!""And it's the softest thing you ever saw."The telephone at the desk rang, and Mary spoke into it for amoment, then rose and excused herself to resume the conversationover the wire more privately in the booth. The instant she wasout of the room, Griggs turned to Garson anxiously.</p> 
<p>　　"It's a cinch, Joe," he pleaded. "I've got a plan of the house."He drew a paper from his breast-pocket, and handed it to theforger, who seized it avidly and studied it with intent,avaricious eyes.</p> 
<p>　　"It looks easy," Garson agreed, as he gave back the paper.</p> 
<p>　　"It is easy," Griggs reiterated. "What do you say?"Garson shook his head in refusal, but there was no conviction inthe act.</p> 
<p>　　"I promised Mary never to----"Griggs broke in on him.</p> 
<p>　　"But a chance like this! Anyhow, come around to the back room atBlinkey's to-night, and we'll have a talk. Will you?""What time?" Garson asked hesitatingly, tempted.</p> 
<p>　　"Make it early, say nine," was the answer. "Will you?""I'll come," Garson replied, half-guiltily. And in the samemoment Mary reentered.</p> 
<p>　　Griggs rose and spoke with an air of regret.</p> 
<p>　　"It's 'follow the leader,' " he said, "and since you are againstit, that settles it.""Yes, I'm against it," Mary said, firmly.</p> 
<p>　　"I'm sorry," English Eddie rejoined. "But we must all play thegame as we see it.... Well, that was the business I was after,and, as it's finished, why, good-afternoon, Miss Turner." Henodded toward Joe, and took his departure.</p> 
<p>　　Something of what was in his mind was revealed in Garson's firstspeech after Griggs's going.</p> 
<p>　　"That's a mighty big stake he's playing for.""And a big chance he's taking!" Mary retorted. "No, Joe, wedon't want any of that. We'll play a game that's safe and sure."The words recalled to the forger weird forebodings that had beentroubling him throughout the day.</p> 
<p>　　"It's sure enough," he stated, "but is it safe?"Mary looked up quickly.</p> 
<p>　　"What do you mean?" she demanded.</p> 
<p>　　Garson walked to and fro nervously as he answered.</p> 
<p>　　"S'pose the bulls get tired of you putting it over on 'em and trysome rough work?"Mary smiled carelessly.</p> 
<p>　　"Don't worry, Joe," she advised. "I know a way to stop it.""Well, so far as that goes, so do I," the forger said, withsignificant emphasis.</p> 
<p>　　"Just what do you mean by that?" Mary demanded, suspiciously.</p> 
<p>　　"For rough work," he said, "I have this." He took a magazinepistol from his pocket. It was of an odd shape, with a barrellonger than is usual and a bell-shaped contrivance attached tothe muzzle.</p> 
<p>　　"No, no, Joe," Mary cried, greatly discomposed. "None ofthat--ever!"The forger smiled, and there was malignant triumph in hisexpression.</p> 
<p>　　"Pooh!" he exclaimed. "Even if I used it, they would never geton to me. See this?" He pointed at the strange contrivance onthe muzzle.</p> 
<p>　　Mary's curiosity made her forget for a moment her distaste.</p> 
<p>　　"What is it?" she asked, interestedly. "I have never seenanything like that before.""Of course you haven't," Garson answered with much pride. "I'mthe first man in the business to get one, and I'll bet on it. Ikeep up with the times." For once, he was revealing thatfundamental egotism which is the characteristic of all his kind.</p> 
<p>　　"That's one of the new Maxim silencers," he continued. "Withsmokeless powder in the cartridges, and the silencer on, I canmake a shot from my coat-pocket, and you wouldn't even know ithad been done. . .. And I'm some shot, believe me.""Impossible!" Mary ejaculated.</p> 
<p>　　"No, it ain't," the man asserted. "Here, wait, I'll show you.""Good gracious, not here!" Mary exclaimed in alarm. "We wouldhave the whole place down on us."Garson chuckled.</p> 
<p>　　"You just watch that dinky little vase on the table across theroom there. 'Tain't very valuable, is it?""No," Mary answered.</p> 
<p>　　In the same instant, while still her eyes were on the vase, itfell in a cascade of shivered glass to the table and floor. Shehad heard no sound, she saw no smoke. Perhaps, there had been afaintest clicking noise. She was not sure. She stareddumfounded for a few seconds, then turned her bewildered facetoward Garson, who was grinning in high enjoyment.</p> 
<p>　　"I would'nt have believed it possible," she declared, vastlyimpressed.</p> 
<p>　　"Neat little thing, ain't it?" the man asked, exultantly.</p> 
<p>　　"Where did you get it?" Mary asked.</p> 
<p>　　"In Boston, last week. And between you and me, Mary, it's theonly model, and it sure is a corker for crime."The sinister association of ideas made Mary shudder, but she saidno more. She would have shuddered again, if she could haveguessed the vital part that pistol was destined to play. But shehad no thought of any actual peril to come from it. She mighthave thought otherwise, could she have known of the meeting thatnight in the back room of Blinkey's, where English Eddie andGarson sat with their heads close together over a table.</p> 
<p>　　"A chance like this," Griggs was saying, "a chance that will makea fortune for all of us.""It sounds good," Garson admitted, wistfully.</p> 
<p>　　"It is good," the other declared with an oath. "Why, if thisgoes through, we're set up for life. We can quit, all of us.""Yes," Garson agreed, "we can quit, all of us." There wasavarice in his voice.</p> 
<p>　　The tempter was sure that the battle was won, and smiledcontentedly.</p> 
<p>　　"Well," he urged, "what do you say?""How would we split it?" It was plain that Garson had given overthe struggle against greed. After all, Mary was only a woman,despite her cleverness, and with all a woman's timidity. Herewas sport for men.</p> 
<p>　　"Three ways would be right," Griggs answered. "One to me, one toyou and one to be divided up among the others."Garson brought his fist down on the table with a force that madethe glasses jingle.</p> 
<p>　　"You're on," he said, strongly.</p> 
<p>　　"Fine!" Griggs declared, and the two men shook hands. "Now, I'llget----""Get nothing!" Garson interrupted. "I'll get my own men.</p> 
<p>　　Chicago Red is in town. So is Dacey, with perhaps a couple ofothers of the right sort. I'll get them to meet you at Blinkey'sat two to-morrow afternoon, and, if it looks right, we'll turnthe trick to-morrow night.""That's the stuff," Griggs agreed, greatly pleased.</p> 
<p>　　But a sudden shadow fell on the face of Garson. He bent closerto his companion, and spoke with a fierce intensity that brookedno denial.</p> 
<p>　　"She must never know."Griggs nodded understandingly.</p> 
<p>　　"Of course," he answered. "I give you my word that I'll nevertell her. And you know you can trust me, Joe.""Yes," the forger replied somberly, "I know I can trust you."But the shadow did not lift from his face.</p>
