Forthe time being, conscience was muted by gratified ambition. Herthoughts just then were far from the miseries of the past, withtheir evil train of consequences in the present. But that pastwas soon to be recalled to her with a vividness most terrible.</p> 
<p>　　She had entered the telephone-booth, which she had caused to beinstalled out of an extra closet of her bedroom for the sake ofgreater privacy on occasion, and it was during her absence fromthe drawing-room that Garson again came into the apartment,seeking her. On being told by Aggie as to Mary's whereabouts, hesat down to await her return, listening without much interest tothe chatter of the adventuress.... It was just then that the maidappeared.</p> 
<p>　　"There's a girl wants to see Miss Turner," she explained.</p> 
<p>　　The irrepressible Aggie put on her most finically elegant air.</p> 
<p>　　"Has she a card?" she inquired haughtily, while the maidtittered appreciation.</p> 
<p>　　"No," was the answer. "But she says it's important. I guess thepoor thing's in hard luck, from the look of her," the kindlyFannie added.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, then she'll be welcome, of course," Aggie declared, andGarson nodded in acquiescence. "Tell her to come in and wait,Fannie. Miss Turner will be here right away." She turned toGarson as the maid left the room. "Mary sure is an easy boob,"she remarked, cheerfully. "Bless her soft heart!"A curiously gentle smile of appreciation softened the immobilityof the forger's face as he again nodded assent.</p> 
<p>　　"We might just as well pipe off the skirt before Mary gets here,"Aggie suggested, with eagerness.</p> 
<p>　　A minute later, a girl perhaps twenty years of age stepped justwithin the doorway, and stood there with eyes downcast, after oneswift, furtive glance about her. Her whole appearance was that ofdejection. Her soiled black gown, the cringing posture, thepallor of her face, proclaimed the abject misery of her state.</p> 
<p>　　Aggie, who was not exuberant in her sympathies for any one otherthan herself, addressed the newcomer with a patronizinginflection, modulated in her best manner.</p> 
<p>　　"Won't you come in, please?" she requested.</p> 
<p>　　The shrinking girl shot another veiled look in the direction ofthe speaker.</p> 
<p>　　"Are you Miss Turner?" she asked, in a voice broken by nervousdismay.</p> 
<p>　　"Really, I am very sorry," Aggie replied, primly; "but I am onlyher cousin, Miss Agnes Lynch. But Miss Turner is likely to beback any minute now.""Can I wait?" came the timid question.</p> 
<p>　　"Certainly," Aggie answered, hospitably. "Please sit down."As the girl obediently sank down on the nearest chair, Garsonaddressed her sharply, so that the visitor started uneasily atthe unexpected sound.</p> 
<p>　　"You don't know Miss Turner?""No," came the faint reply.</p> 
<p>　　"Then, what do you want to see her about?"There was a brief pause before the girl could pluck up courageenough for an answer. Then, it was spoken confusedly, almost ina whisper.</p> 
<p>　　"She once helped a girl friend of mine, and I thought--Ithought----""You thought she might help you," Garson interrupted.</p> 
<p>　　But Aggie, too, possessed some perceptive powers, despite thefact that she preferred to use them little in ordinary affairs.</p> 
<p>　　"You have been in stir--prison, I mean." She hastily correctedthe lapse into underworld slang.</p> 
<p>　　Came a distressed muttering of assent from the girl.</p> 
<p>　　"How sad!" Aggie remarked, in a voice of shocked pity for one soinconceivably unfortunate. "How very, very sad!"This ingenuous method of diversion was put to an end by theentrance of Mary, who stopped short on seeing the limp figurehuddled in the chair.</p> 
<p>　　"A visitor, Agnes?" she inquired.</p> 
<p>　　At the sound of her voice, and before Aggie could hit on afittingly elegant form of reply, the girl looked up. And now,for the first time, she spoke with some degree of energy, albeitthere was a sinister undertone in the husky voice.</p> 
<p>　　"You're Miss Turner?" she questioned.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes," Mary said, simply. Her words rang kindly; and she smiledencouragement.</p> 
<p>　　A gasp burst from the white lips of the girl, and she cowered asone stricken physically.</p> 
<p>　　"Mary Turner! Oh, my God! I----" She hid her face within her armsand sat bent until her head rested on her knees in an abasementof misery.</p> 
<p>　　Vaguely startled by the hysterical outburst from the girl, Mary'simmediate thought was that here was a pitiful instance of onesuffering from starvation.</p> 
<p>　　"Joe," she directed rapidly, "have Fannie bring a glass of milkwith an egg and a little brandy in it, right away."The girl in the chair was shaking soundlessly under the stress ofher emotions. A few disjointed phrases fell from her quiveringlips.</p> 
<p>　　"I didn't know--oh, I couldn't!""Don't try to talk just now," Mary warned, reassuringly. "Waituntil you've had something to eat."Aggie, who had observed developments closely, now lifted hervoice in tardy lamentations over her own stupidity. There was noaffectation of the fine lady in her self-reproach.</p> 
<p>　　"Why, the poor gawk's hungry!" she exclaimed! "And I never gotthe dope on her. Ain't I the simp!"The girl regained a degree of self-control, and showed somethingof forlorn dignity.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes," she said dully, "I'm starving."Mary regarded the afflicted creature with that sympathy born onlyof experience.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes," she said softly, "I understand." Then she spoke to Aggie.</p> 
<p>　　"Take her to my room, and let her rest there for a while. Haveher drink the egg and milk slowly, and then lie down for a fewminutes anyhow."Aggie obeyed with an air of bustling activity.</p> 
<p>　　"Sure, I will!" she declared. She went to the girl and helpedher to stand up. "We'll fix you out all right," she said,comfortingly. "Come along with me.... Hungry! Gee, but that'stough!"Half an hour afterward, while Mary was at her desk, giving partof her attention to Joe Garson, who sat near, and part to arather formidable pile of neatly arranged papers, Aggie reportedwith her charge, who, though still shambling of gait, andstooping, showed by some faint color in her face and an increasedsteadiness of bearing that the food had already strengthened hermuch.</p> 
<p>　　"She would come," Aggie explained. "I thought she ought to restfor a while longer anyhow." She half-shoved the girl into achair opposite the desk, in an absurd travesty on the maternalmanner.</p> 
<p>　　"I'm all right, I tell you," came the querulous protest.</p> 
<p>　　Whereupon, Aggie gave over the uncongenial task of mothering, andsettled herself comfortably in a chair, with her legs merelycrossed as a compromise between ease and propriety.</p> 
<p>　　"Are you quite sure?" Mary said to the girl. And then, as theother nodded in assent, she spoke with a compelling kindliness.</p> 
<p>　　"Then you must tell us all about it--this trouble of yours, youknow. What is your name?"Once again the girl had recourse to the swift, searching, furtiveglance, but her voice was colorless as she replied, listlessly:</p> 
<p>　　"Helen Morris."Mary regarded the girl with an expression that was inscrutablewhen she spoke again.</p> 
<p>　　"I don't have to ask if you have been in prison," she saidgravely. "Your face shows it.""I--I came out--three months ago," was the halting admission.</p> 
<p>　　Mary watched the shrinking figure reflectively for a long minutebefore she spoke again. Then there was a deeper resonance in hervoice.</p> 
<p>　　"And you'd made up your mind to go straight?""Yes." The word was a whisper.</p> 
<p>　　"You were going to do what the chaplain had told you," Mary wenton in a voice vibrant with varied emotions. "You were going tostart all over again, weren't you? You were going to begin a newlife, weren't you?" The bent head of the girl bent still lowerin assent. There came a cynical note into Mary's utterance now.</p> 
<p>　　"It doesn't work very well, does it?" she asked, bitterly.</p> 
<p>　　The girl gave sullen agreement.</p> 
<p>　　"No," she said dully; "I'm whipped."Mary's manner changed on the instant. She spoke cheerfully forthe first time.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, then," she questioned, "how would you like to work withus?"The girl looked up for a second with another of her fleeting,stealthy glances.</p> 
<p>　　"You--you mean that----?"Mary explained her intention in the matter very explicitly. Hervoice grew boastful.</p> 
<p>　　"Our kind of work pays well when you know how. Look at us."Aggie welcomed the opportunity for speech, too long delayed.</p> 
<p>　　"Hats from Joseph's, gowns from Lucile's, and cracked ice fromTiffany's. But it ain't ladylike to wear it," she concluded witha reproachful glance at her mentor.</p> 
<p>　　Mary disregarded the frivolous interruption, and went on speakingto the girl, and now there was something pleasantly cajoling inher manner.</p> 
<p>　　"Suppose I should stake you for the present, and put you in witha good crowd. All you would have to do would be to answeradvertisements for servant girls. I will see that you have thebest of references. Then, when you get in with the right people,you will open the front door some night and let in the gang. Ofcourse, you will make a get-away when they do, and get your bitas well."There flashed still another of the swift, sly glances, and thelips of the girl parted as if she would speak. But she did not;only, her head sagged even lower on her breast, and the shrunkenform grew yet more shrunken. Mary, watching closely, saw thesesigns, and in the same instant a change came over her. Wherebefore there had been an underlying suggestion of hardness, therewas now a womanly warmth of genuine sympathy.</p> 
<p>　　"It doesn't suit you?" she said, very softly. "Good! I was inhopes it wouldn't. So, here's another plan." Her voice hadbecome very winning. "Suppose you could go West--some placewhere you would have a fair chance, with money enough so youcould live like a human being till you got a start?"There came a tensing of the relaxed form, and the head lifted alittle so that the girl could look at her questioner. And, thistime, the glance, though of the briefest, was less furtive.</p> 
<p>　　"I will give you that chance," Mary said simply, "if you reallywant it."That speech was like a current of strength to the wretched girl.</p> 
<p>　　She sat suddenly erect, and her words came eagerly.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, I do!" And now her hungry gaze remained fast on the face ofthe woman who offered her salvation.</p> 
<p>　　Mary sprang up and moved a step toward the girl who continued tostare at her, fascinated. She was now all wholesome. The memoryof her own wrongs surged in her during this moment only to makeher more appreciative of the blessedness of seemly life. She wasmoved to a divine compassion over this waif for whom she mightprove a beneficent providence. There was profound conviction inthe emphasis with which she spoke her warning.</p> 
<p>　　"Then I have just one thing to say to you first. If you aregoing to live straight, start straight, and then go through withit. Do you know what that means?""You mean, keep straight all the time?" The girl spoke with aforce drawn from the other's strength.</p> 
<p>　　"I mean more than that," Mary went on earnestly. "I mean, forgetthat you were ever in prison. I don't know what you have done--Idon't think I care. But whatever it was, you have paid for it--apretty big price, too." Into these last words there crept thepathos of one who knew. The sympathy of it stirred the listenerto fearful memories.</p> 
<p>　　"I have, I have!" The thin voice broke, wailing.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, then," Mary went on, "just begin all over again, and besure you stand up for your rights. Don't let them make you pay asecond time. Go where no one knows you, and don't tell the firstpeople who are kind to you that you have been crooked. If theythink you are straight, why, be it. Then nobody will have anyright to complain." Her tone grew suddenly pleading. "Will youpromise me this?""Yes, I promise," came the answer, very gravely, quickened withhope.</p> 
<p>　　"Good!" Mary exclaimed, with a smile of approval. "Wait aminute," she added, and left the room.</p> 
<p>　　"Huh! Pretty soft for some people," Aggie remarked to Garson,with a sniff. She felt no alarm lest she wound the sensibilitiesof the girl. She herself had never let delicacy interferebetween herself and money. It was really stranger that theforger, who possessed a more sympathetic nature, did not scrupleto speak an assent openly. Somehow, he felt an inexplicableprejudice against this abject recipient of Mary's bounty, thoughnot for the world would he have checked the generous impulse onthe part of the woman he so revered. It was his instinct on herbehalf that made him now vaguely uneasy, as if he sensed somemalign influence against her there present with them.</p> 
<p>　　Mary returned soon. In her hand she carried a roll of bills.</p> 
<p>　　She went to the girl and held out the money. Her voice wasbusiness-like now, but very kind.</p> 
<p>　　"Take this. It will pay your fare West, and keep you quite awhile if you are careful."But, without warning, a revulsion seized on the girl. Of asudden, she shrank again, and turned her head away, and her bodytrembled.</p> 
<p>　　"I can't take it," she stammered. "I can't! I can't!"Mary stood silent for a moment from sheer amazement over thechange. When she spoke, her voice had hardened a little. It isnot agreeable to have one's beneficence flouted.</p> 
<p>　　"Didn't you come here for help?" she demanded.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes," was the faltering reply, "but--but--I didn't know--it wasyou!" The words came with a rush of desperation.</p> 
<p>　　"Then, you have met me before?" Mary said, quietly.</p> 
<p>　　"No, no!" The girl's voice rose shrill.</p> 
<p>　　Aggie spoke her mind with commendable frankness.</p> 
<p>　　"She's lying."And, once again, Garson agreed. His yes was spoken in a tone ofcomplete certainty. That Mary, too, was of their opinion wasshown in her next words.</p> 
<p>　　"So, you have met me before? Where?"The girl unwittingly made confession in her halting words.</p> 
<p>　　"I--I can't tell you." There was despair in her voice.</p> 
<p>　　"You must." Mary spoke with severity. She felt that thismystery held in it something sinister to herself. "You must," sherepeated imperiously.</p> 
<p>　　The girl only crouched lower.</p> 
<p>　　"I can't!" she cried again. She was panting as if in exhaustion.</p> 
<p>　　"Why can't you?" Mary insisted. She had no sympathy now for thegirl's distress, merely a great suspicious curiosity.</p> 
<p>　　"Because--because----" The girl could not go on.</p> 
<p>　　Mary's usual shrewdness came to her aid, and she put her nextquestion in a different direction.</p> 
<p>　　"What were you sent up for?" she asked briskly. "Tell me."It was Garson who broke the silence that followed.</p> 
<p>　　"Come on, now!" he ordered. There was a savage note in his voiceunder which the girl visibly winced. Mary made a gesture towardhim that he should not interfere. Nevertheless, the man'scommand had in it a threat which the girl could not resist andshe answered, though with a reluctance that made the words seemdragged from her by some outside force--as indeed they were.</p> 
<p>　　"For stealing.""Stealing what?" Mary said.</p> 
<p>　　"Goods.""Where from?"A reply came in a breath so low that it was barely audible.</p> 
<p>　　"The Emporium."In a flash of intuition, the whole truth was revealed to thewoman who stood looking down at the cowering creature before her.</p> 
<p>　　"The Emporium!" she repeated. There was a tragedy in the singleword. Her voice grew cold with hate, the hate born of innocencelong tortured. "Then you are the one who----"The accusation was cut short by the girl's shriek.</p> 
<p>　　"I am not! I am not, I tell you."For a moment, Mary lost her poise. Her voice rose in a flare ofrage.</p> 
<p>　　"You are! You are!"The craven spirit of the girl could struggle no more. She couldonly sit in a huddled, shaking heap of dread. The woman beforeher had been disciplined by sorrow to sternest self-control.</p> 
<p>　　Though racked by emotions most intolerable, Mary soon masteredtheir expression to such an extent that when she spoke again, asif in self-communion, her words came quietly, yet with overtonesof a supreme wo.</p> 
<p>　　"She did it!" Then, after a little, she addressed the girl with acertain wondering before this mystery of horror. "Why did youthrow the blame on me?"The girl made several efforts before her mumbling becameintelligible, and then her speech was gasping, broken with fear.</p> 
<p>　　"I found out they were watching me, and I was afraid they wouldcatch me. So, I took them and ran into the cloak-room, and putthem in a locker that wasn't close to mine, and some in thepocket of a coat that was hanging there. God knows I didn't knowwhose it was. I just put them there--I was frightened----""And you let me go to prison for three years!" There was a menacein Mary's voice under which the girl cringed again.</p> 
<p>　　"I was scared," she whined. "I didn't dare to tell.""But they caught you later," Mary went on inexorably. "Why didn'tyou tell then?""I was afraid," came the answer from the shuddering girl. "Itold them it was the first time I had taken anything and they letme off with a year."Once more, the wrath of the victim flamed high.</p> 
<p>　　"You!" Mary cried. "You cried and lied, and they let you offwith a year. I wouldn't cry. I told the truth --and----" Hervoice broke in a tearless sob. The color had gone out of herface, and she stood rigid, looking down at the girl whose crimehad ruined her life with an expression of infinite loathing inher eyes. Garson rose from his chair as if to go to her, and hisface passed swiftly from compassion to ferocity as his gaze wentfrom the woman he had saved from the river to the girl who hadbeen the first cause of her seeking a grave in the waters. Yet,though he longed with every fiber of him to comfort the strickenwoman, he did not dare intrude upon her in this time of heranguish, but quietly dropped back into his seat and sat watchingwith eyes now tender, now baleful, as they shifted theirdirection.</p> 
<p>　　Aggie took advantage of the pause. Her voice was acid.</p> 
<p>　　"Some people are sneaks--just sneaks!"Somehow, the speech was welcome to the girl, gave her a touch ofcourage sufficient for cowardly protestations. It seemed torelieve the tension drawn by the other woman's torment. It wasmore like the abuse that was familiar to her. A gush of tearscame.</p> 
<p>　　"I'll never forgive myself, never!" she moaned.</p> 
<p>　　Contempt mounted in Mary's breast.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, yes, you will," she said, malevolently. "People forgivethemselves pretty easily." The contempt checked for a little theravages of her grief. "Stop crying," she commanded harshly.</p> 
<p>　　"Nobody is going to hurt you." She thrust the money again towardthe girl, and crowded it into the half-reluctant, half-greedyhand.</p> 
<p>　　"Take it, and get out." The contempt in her voice rang stillsharper, mordant.</p> 
<p>　　Even the puling creature writhed under the lash of Mary's tones.</p> 
<p>　　She sprang up, slinking back a step.</p> 
<p>　　"I can't take it!" she cried, whimpering. But she did not dropthe money.</p> 
<p>　　"Take the chance while you have it," Mary counseled, still withthe contempt that pierced even the hardened girl's sense ofselfishness. She pointed toward the door. "Go!--before I changemy mind."The girl needed, indeed, no second bidding. With the money stillclutched in her hand, she went forth swiftly, stumbling a littlein her haste, fearful lest, at the last moment, the woman she hadso wronged should in fact change in mood, take back themoney--ay, even give her over to that terrible man with the eyesof hate, to put her to death as she deserved.</p> 
<p>　　Freed from the miasma of that presence, Mary remained motionlessfor a long minute, then sighed from her tortured heart. Sheturned and went slowly to her chair at the desk, and seatedherself languidly, weakened by the ordeal through which she hadpassed.</p> 
<p>　　"A girl I didn't know!" she said, bewilderedly; "perhaps hadnever spoken to--who smashed my life like that! Oh, if it wasn'tso awful, it would be--funny! It would be funny!" A gust ofhysterical laughter burst from her. "Why, it is funny!" shecried, wildly. "It is funny!""Mary!" Garson exclaimed sharply. He leaped across the room toface her. "That's no good!" he said severely.</p> 
<p>　　Aggie, too, rushed forward.</p> 
<p>　　"No good at all!" she declared loudly.</p> 
<p>　　The interference recalled the distressed woman to herself. Shemade a desperate effort for self-command. Little by little, theunmeaning look died down, and presently she sat silent andmoveless, staring at the two with stormy eyes out of a wan face.</p> 
<p>　　"You were right," she said at last, in a lifeless voice. "It'sdone, and can't be undone. I was a fool to let it affect me likethat. I really thought I had lost all feeling about it, but thesight of that girl--the knowledge that she had done it--broughtit all back to me. Well, you understand, don't you?""We understand," Garson said, grimly. But there was more thangrimness, infinitely more, in the expression of his clear,glowing eyes.</p> 
<p>　　Aggie thought that it was her turn to voice herself, which shedid without undue restraint.</p> 
<p>　　"Perhaps, we do, but I dunno! I'll tell you one thing, though.</p> 
<p>　　If any dame sent me up for three years and then wanted money fromme, do you think she'd get it? Wake me up any time in the nightand ask me. Not much--not a little bit much! I'd hang on to itlike an old woman to her last tooth." And that was Aggie's finalsumming up of her impressions concerning the scene she had justwitnessed.</p>
