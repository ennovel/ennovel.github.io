In the present instance, he had failedutterly to obtain any information of value from the girl whom hehad just been examining. On the contrary, he had been befooledoutrageously by a female criminal, in a manner to wound deeplyhis professional pride. Nevertheless, he bore no grudge againstthe adventuress. His sense of the absurd served him well, and hetook a lively enjoyment in recalling the method by which herplausible wiles had beguiled him. He gave her a real respect forthe adroitness with which she had deceived him--and he was notone to be readily deceived. So, now, as the scornful maiden wentout of the door under the escort of Cassidy, Burke bowedgallantly to her lithe back, and blew a kiss from his thickfingertips, in mocking reverence for her as an artist in her way.</p> 
<p>　　Then, he seated himself, pressed the desk call-button, and, whenhe had learned that Edward Gilder was arrived, ordered that themagnate and the District Attorney be admitted, and that the son,also, be sent up from his cell.</p> 
<p>　　"It's a bad business, sir," Burke said, with hearty sympathy, tothe shaken father, after the formal greetings that followed theentrance of the two men. "It's a very bad business.""What does he say?" Gilder questioned. There was somethingpitiful in the distress of this man, usually so strong and socertain of his course. Now, he was hesitant in his movements,and his mellow voice came more weakly than its wont. There was apathetic pleading in the dulled eyes with which he regarded theInspector.</p> 
<p>　　"Nothing!" Burke answered. "That's why I sent for you. Isuppose Mr. Demarest has made the situation plain to you."Gilder nodded, his face miserable.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes," he has explained it to me," he said in a lifeless voice.</p> 
<p>　　"It's a terrible position for my boy. But you'll release him atonce, won't you?" Though he strove to put confidence into hiswords, his painful doubt was manifest.</p> 
<p>　　"I can't," Burke replied, reluctantly, but bluntly. "You oughtnot to expect it, Mr. Gilder.""But," came the protest, delivered with much more spirit, "youknow very well that he didn't do it!"Burke shook his head emphatically in denial of the allegation.</p> 
<p>　　"I don't know anything about it--yet," he contradicted.</p> 
<p>　　The face of the magnate went white with fear.</p> 
<p>　　"Inspector," he cried brokenly, "you--don't mean--"Burke answered with entire candor.</p> 
<p>　　"I mean, Mr. Gilder, that you've got to make him talk. That'swhat I want you to do, for all our sakes. Will you?""I'll do my best," the unhappy man replied, forlornly.</p> 
<p>　　A minute later, Dick, in charge of an officer, was brought intothe room. He was pale, a little disheveled from his hours in acell. He still wore his evening clothes of the night before.</p> 
<p>　　His face showed clearly the deepened lines, graven by thesuffering to which he had been subjected, but there was noweakness in his expression. Instead, a new force that love andsorrow had brought out in his character was plainly visible. Thestrength of his nature was springing to full life under thestimulus of the ordeal through which he was passing.</p> 
<p>　　The father went forward quickly, and caught Dick's hands in amighty grip.</p> 
<p>　　"My boy!" he murmured, huskily. Then, he made a great effort,and controlled his emotion to some extent. "The Inspector tellsme," he went on, "that you've refused to talk--to answer hisquestions."Dick, too, winced under the pain of this meeting with his fatherin a situation so sinister. But he was, to some degree,apathetic from over-much misery. Now, in reply to his father'swords, he only nodded a quiet assent.</p> 
<p>　　"That wasn't wise under the circumstances," the fatherremonstrated hurriedly. "However, now, Demarest and I are hereto protect your interests, so that you can talk freely." He wenton with a little catch of anxiety in his voice. "Now, Dick, tellus! Who killed that man? We must know. Tell me."Burke broke in impatiently, with his blustering fashion ofaddress.</p> 
<p>　　"Where did you get----?"But Demarest raised a restraining hand.</p> 
<p>　　"Wait, please!" he admonished the Inspector. "You wait a bit."He went a step toward the young man. "Give the boy a chance," hesaid, and his voice was very friendly as he went on speaking.</p> 
<p>　　"Dick, I don't want to frighten you, but your position is reallya dangerous one. Your only chance is to speak with perfectfrankness. I pledge you my word, I'm telling the truth, Dick."There was profound concern in the lawyer's thin face, and hisvoice, trained to oratorical arts, was emotionally persuasive.</p> 
<p>　　"Dick, my boy, I want you to forget that I'm the DistrictAttorney, and remember only that I'm an old friend of yours, andof your father's, who is trying very hard to help you. Surely,you can trust me. Now, Dick, tell me: Who shot Griggs?"There came a long pause. Burke's face was avid with desire forknowledge, with the keen expectancy of the hunter on the trail,which was characteristic of him in his professional work. TheDistrict Attorney himself was less vitally eager, but hiscuriosity, as well as his wish to escape from an embarrassingsituation, showed openly on his alert countenance. The heavyfeatures of the father were twisting a little in nervous spasms,for to him this hour was all anguish, since his only son was insuch horrible plight. Dick alone seemed almost tranquil, thoughthe outward calm was belied by the flickering of his eyelids andthe occasional involuntary movement of the lips. Finally hespoke, in a cold, weary voice.</p> 
<p>　　"I shot Griggs," he said.</p> 
<p>　　Demarest realized subtly that his plea had failed, but he made areffort to resist the impression, to take the admission at itsface value.</p> 
<p>　　"Why?" he demanded.</p> 
<p>　　Dick's answer came in the like unmeaning tones, and as wearily.</p> 
<p>　　"Because I thought he was a burglar."The District Attorney was beginning to feel his professionalpride aroused against this young man who so flagrantly repelledhis attempts to learn the truth concerning the crime that hadbeen committed. He resorted to familiar artifices for entanglingone questioned.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, I see!" he said, in a tone of conviction. "Now, let's goback a little. Burke says you told him last night that you hadpersuaded your wife to come over to the house, and join youthere. Is that right?""Yes." The monosyllable was uttered indifferently. "And,while the two of you were talking," Demarest continued in amatter-of-fact manner. He did not conclude the sentence, butasked instead: "Now, tell me, Dick, just what did happen, won'tyou?"There was no reply; and, after a little interval, the lawyerresumed his questioning.</p> 
<p>　　"Did this burglar come into the room?"Dick nodded an assent.</p> 
<p>　　"And he attacked you?"There came another nod of affirmation.</p> 
<p>　　"And there was a struggle?""Yes," Dick said, and now there was resolution in his answer.</p> 
<p>　　"And you shot him?" Demarest asked, smoothly.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes," the young man said again.</p> 
<p>　　"Then," the lawyer countered on the instant, "where did you getthe revolver?"Dick started to answer without thought:</p> 
<p>　　"Why, I grabbed it----" Then, the significance of this crashed onhis consciousness, and he checked the words trembling on hislips. His eyes, which had been downcast, lifted and glared onthe questioner. "So," he said with swift hostility in his voice,"so, you're trying to trap me, too!" He shrugged his shoulders ina way he had learned abroad. "You! And you talk of friendship.</p> 
<p>　　I want none of such friendship."Demarest, greatly disconcerted, was skilled, nevertheless, indissembling, and he hid his chagrin perfectly. There was onlyreproach in his voice as he answered stoutly:</p> 
<p>　　"I am your friend, Dick."But Burke would be no longer restrained. He had listened withincreasing impatience to the diplomatic efforts of the DistrictAttorney, which had ended in total rout. Now, he insisted onemploying his own more drastic, and, as he believed, moreefficacious, methods. He stood up, and spoke in his mostthreatening manner.</p> 
<p>　　"You don't want to take us for fools, young man," he said, andhis big tones rumbled harshly through the room. "If you shotGriggs in mistake for a burglar, why did you try to hide thefact? Why did you pretend to me that you and your wife werealone in the room--when you had *THAT there with you, eh? Whydidn't you call for help? Why didn't you call for the police, asany honest man would naturally under such circumstances?"The arraignment was severely logical. Dick showed hisappreciation of the justice of it in the whitening of his face,nor did he try to answer the charges thus hurled at him.</p> 
<p>　　The father, too, appreciated the gravity of the situation. Hisface was working, as if toward tears.</p> 
<p>　　"We're trying to save you," he pleaded, tremulously.</p> 
<p>　　Burke persisted in his vehement system of attack. Now, he againbrought out the weapon that had done Eddie Griggs to death.</p> 
<p>　　"Where'd you get this gun?" he shouted.</p> 
<p>　　Dick held his tranquil pose.</p> 
<p>　　"I won't talk any more," he answered, simply. "I must see mywife first." His voice became more aggressive. "I want to knowwhat you've done to her."Burke seized on this opening.</p> 
<p>　　"Did she kill Griggs?" he questioned, roughly.</p> 
<p>　　For once, Dick was startled out of his calm.</p> 
<p>　　"No, no!" he cried, desperately.</p> 
<p>　　Burke followed up his advantage.</p> 
<p>　　"Then, who did?" he demanded, sharply. "Who did?"Now, however, the young man had regained his self-control. Heanswered very quietly, but with an air of finality.</p> 
<p>　　"I won't say any more until I've talked with a lawyer whom I cantrust." He shot a vindictive glance toward Demarest.</p> 
<p>　　The father intervened with a piteous eagerness.</p> 
<p>　　"Dick, if you know who killed this man, you must speak to protectyourself."Burke's voice came viciously.</p> 
<p>　　"The gun was found on you. Don't forget that.""You don't seem to realize the position you're in," the fatherinsisted, despairingly. "Think of me, Dick, my boy. If youwon't speak for your own sake, do it for mine."The face of the young man softened as he met his father'sbeseeching eyes.</p> 
<p>　　"I'm sorry, Dad," he said, very gently. "But I--well, I can't!"Again, Burke interposed. His busy brain was working out a newscheme for solving this irritating problem.</p> 
<p>　　"I'm going to give him a little more time to think things over,"he said, curtly. He went back to his chair. "Perhaps he'll getto understand the importance of what we've been saying prettysoon." He scowled at Dick. "Now, young man," he went on briskly,"you want to do a lot of quick thinking, and a lot of honestthinking, and, when you're ready to tell the truth, let me know."He pressed the button on his desk, and, as the doorman appeared,addressed that functionary.</p> 
<p>　　"Dan, have one of the men take him back. You wait outside."Dick, however, did not move. His voice came with a note ofdetermination.</p> 
<p>　　"I want to know about my wife. Where is she?"Burke disregarded the question as completely as if it had notbeen uttered, and went on speaking to the doorman with asuggestion in his words that was effective.</p> 
<p>　　"He's not to speak to any one, you understand." Then hecondescended to give his attention to the prisoner. "You'll knowall about your wife, young man, when you make up your mind totell me the truth."Dick gave no heed to the Inspector's statement. His eyes werefixed on his father, and there was a great tenderness in theirdepths. And he spoke very softly:</p> 
<p>　　"Dad, I'm sorry!"The father's gaze met the son's, and the eyes of the two locked.</p> 
<p>　　There was no other word spoken. Dick turned, and followed hiscustodian out of the office in silence. Even after the shuttingof the door behind the prisoner, the pause endured for somemoments.</p> 
<p>　　Then, at last, Burke spoke to the magnate.</p> 
<p>　　"You see, Mr. Gilder, what we're up against. I can't let himgo--yet!"The father strode across the room in a sudden access of rage.</p> 
<p>　　"He's thinking of that woman," he cried out, in a loud voice.</p> 
<p>　　"He's trying to shield her.""He's a loyal kid, at that," Burke commented, with a grudgingadmiration. "I'll say that much for him." His expression grewmorose, as again he pressed the button on his desk. "And now,"he vouchsafed, "I'll show you the difference." Then, as thedoorman reappeared, he gave his order: "Dan, have the Turnerwoman brought up." He regarded the two men with his bristlingbrows pulled down in a scowl. "I'll have to try a different gamewith her," he said, thoughtfully. "She sure is one clever littledame. But, if she didn't do it herself, she knows who did, allright." Again, Burke's voice took on its savage note. "And someone's got to pay for killing Griggs. I don't have to explain whyto Mr. Demarest, but to you, Mr. Gilder. You see, it's this way:</p> 
<p>　　The very foundations of the work done by this department rest onthe use of crooks, who are willing to betray their pals for coin.</p> 
<p>　　I told you a bit about it last night. Now, you understand, ifGriggs's murder goes unpunished, it'll put the fear of God intothe heart of every stool-pigeon we employ. And then where'd webe? Tell me that!"The Inspector next called his stenographer, and gave explicitdirections. At the back of the room, behind the desk, were threelarge windows, which opened on a corridor, and across this was atier of cells. The stenographer was to take his seat in thiscorridor, just outside one of the windows. Over the windows, theshades were drawn, so that he would remain invisible to any onewithin the office, while yet easily able to overhear every wordspoken in the room.</p> 
<p>　　When he had completed his instructions to the stenographer, Burketurned to Gilder and Demarest.</p> 
<p>　　"Now, this time," he said energetically, "I'll be the one to dothe talking. And get this: Whatever you hear me say, don't yoube surprised. Remember, we're dealing with crooks, and, whenyou're dealing with crooks, you have to use crooked ways."There was a brief period of silence. Then, the door opened, andMary Turner entered the office. She walked slowly forward,moving with the smooth strength and grace that were the proof ofperfect health and of perfect poise, the correlation of mind andbody in exactness. Her form, clearly revealed by the clingingevening dress, was a curving group of graces. The beauty of herface was enhanced, rather than lessened, by the pallor of it, forthe fading of the richer colors gave to the fine features anexpression more spiritual, made plainer the underlying qualitiesthat her accustomed brilliance might half-conceal. She paidabsolutely no attention to the other two in the room, but wentstraight to the desk, and there halted, gazing with her softlypenetrant eyes of deepest violet into the face of the Inspector.</p> 
<p>　　Under that intent scrutiny, Burke felt a challenge, set himselfto match craft with craft. He was not likely to undervalue thewits of one who had so often flouted him, who, even now, hadplaced him in a preposterous predicament by this entanglementover the death of a spy. But he was resolved to use his bestskill to disarm her sophistication. His large voice wasmodulated to kindliness as he spoke in a casual manner.</p> 
<p>　　"I just sent for you to tell you that you're free."Mary regarded the speaker with an impenetrable expression. Hertones as she spoke were quite as matter-of-fact as his own hadbeen. In them was no wonder, no exultation.</p> 
<p>　　"Then, I can go," she said, simply.</p> 
<p>　　"Sure, you can go," Burke replied, amiably.</p> 
<p>　　Without any delay, yet without any haste, Mary glanced towardGilder and Demarest, who were watching the scene closely. Hereyes were somehow appraising, but altogether indifferent. Then,she went toward the outer door of the office, still with thatalmost lackadaisical air.</p> 
<p>　　Burke waited rather impatiently until she had nearly reached thedoor before he shot his bolt, with a fine assumption ofcarelessness in the announcement.</p> 
<p>　　"Garson has confessed!"Mary, who readily enough had already guessed the essentialhypocrisy of all this play, turned and confronted the Inspector,and answered without the least trace of fear, but with thefirmness of knowledge:</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, no, he hasn't!"Her attitude exasperated Burke. His voice roared out wrathfully.</p> 
<p>　　"What's the reason he hasn't?"The music in the tones of the answer was a vocal rebuke.</p> 
<p>　　"Because he didn't do it." She stated the fact as one without ahint of any contradictory possibility.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, he says he did it!" Burke vociferated, still more loudly.</p> 
<p>　　Mary, in her turn, resorted to a bit of finesse, in order tolearn whether or not Garson had been arrested. She spoke with atrace of indignation.</p> 
<p>　　"But how could he have done it, when he went----" she began.</p> 
<p>　　The Inspector fell a victim to her superior craft. His questioncame eagerly.</p> 
<p>　　"Where did he go?"Mary smiled for the first time since she had been in the room,and in that smile the Inspector realized his defeat in the firstpassage of this game of intrigue between them.</p> 
<p>　　"You ought to know," she said, sedately, "since you have arrestedhim, and he has confessed."Demarest put up a hand to conceal his smile over the policeofficial's chagrin. Gilder, staring always at this woman who hadcome to be his Nemesis, was marveling over the beauty and verveof the one so hating him as to plan the ruin of his life and hisson's.</p> 
<p>　　Burke was frantic over being worsted thus. To gain a diversion,he reverted to his familiar bullying tactics. His question burstraspingly. It was a question that had come to be constant withinhis brain during the last few hours, one that obsessed him, thatfretted him sorely, almost beyond endurance.</p> 
<p>　　"Who shot Griggs?" he shouted.</p> 
<p>　　Mary rested serene in the presence of this violence. Her answercapped the climax of the officer's exasperation.</p> 
<p>　　"My husband shot a burglar," she said, languidly. And then herinsolence reached its culmination in a query of her own: "Was hisname Griggs?" It was done with splendid art, with a splendidmastery of her own emotions, for, even as she spoke the words,she was remembering those shuddering seconds when she had stood,only a few hours ago, gazing down at the inert bulk that had beena man.</p> 
<p>　　Burke betook himself to another form of attack.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, you know better than that," he declared, truculently. "Yousee, we've traced the Maxim silencer. Garson himself bought it upin Hartford."For the first time, Mary was caught off her guard.</p> 
<p>　　"But he told me----" she began, then became aware of herindiscretion, and checked herself.</p> 
<p>　　Burke seized on her lapse with avidity.</p> 
<p>　　"What did he tell you?" he questioned, eagerly.</p> 
<p>　　Now, Mary had regained her self-command, and she spoke calmly.</p> 
<p>　　"He told me," she said, without a particle of hesitation, "thathe had never seen one. Surely, if he had had anything of thesort, he would have shown it to me then.""Probably he did, too!" Burke rejoined, without the leastsuspicion that his surly utterance touched the truth exactly.</p> 
<p>　　"Now, see here," he went on, trying to make his voice affable,though with small success, for he was excessively irritated bythese repeated failures; "I can make it a lot easier for you ifyou'll talk. Come on, now! Who killed Griggs?"Mary cast off pretense finally, and spoke malignantly.</p> 
<p>　　"That's for you to find out," she said, sneering.</p> 
<p>　　Burke pressed the button on the desk, and, when the doormanappeared, ordered that the prisoner be returned to her cell.</p> 
<p>　　But Mary stood rebellious, and spoke with a resumption of hercynical scorn.</p> 
<p>　　"I suppose," she said, with a glance of contempt toward Demarest,"that it's useless for me to claim my constitutional rights, anddemand to see a lawyer?"Burke, too, had cast off pretense at last.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes," he agreed, with an evil smirk, "you've guessed it right,the first time."Mary spoke to the District Attorney.</p> 
<p>　　"I believe," she said, with a new dignity of bearing, "that suchis my constitutional right, is it not, Mr. Demarest?"The lawyer sought no evasion of the issue. For that matter, hewas coming to have an increasing respect, even admiration, forthis young woman, who endured insult and ignominy with a spiritso sturdy, and met strategem with other strategem better devised.</p> 
<p>　　So, now, he made his answer with frank honesty.</p> 
<p>　　"It is your constitutional right, Miss Turner."Mary turned her clear eyes on the Inspector, and awaited fromthat official a reply that was not forthcoming. Truth to tell,Burke was far from comfortable under that survey.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, Inspector?" she inquired, at last.</p> 
<p>　　Burke took refuge, as his wont was when too hard pressed, in amighty bellow.</p> 
<p>　　"The Constitution don't go here!" It was the best he could do,and it shamed him, for he knew its weakness. Again, wrath surgedin him, and it surged high. He welcomed the advent of Cassidy,who came hurrying in with a grin of satisfaction on his stolidface.</p> 
<p>　　"Say, Chief," the detective said with animation, in response toBurke's glance of inquiry, "we've got Garson."Mary's face fell, though the change of expression was almostimperceptible. Only Demarest, a student of much experience,observed the fleeting display of repressed emotion. When theInspector took thought to look at her, she was as impassive asbefore. Yet, he was minded to try another ruse in his desire todefeat the intelligence of this woman. To this end, he askedGilder and the District Attorney to withdraw, while he shouldhave a private conversation with the prisoner. As she listened tohis request, Mary smiled again in sphinx-like fashion, and therewas still on her lips an expression that caused the official apang of doubt, when, at last, the two were left alone together,and he darted a surreptitious glance toward her. Nevertheless,he pressed on his device valiantly.</p> 
<p>　　"Now," he said, with a marked softening of manner, "I'm going tobe your friend.""Are you?" Mary's tone was non-committal.</p> 
<p>　　"Yes," Burke declared, heartily. "And I mean it! Give up thetruth about young Gilder. I know he shot Griggs, of course. ButI'm not taking any stock in that burglar story--not a little bit!</p> 
<p>　　No court would, either. What was really back of the killing?"Burke's eyes narrowed cunningly. "Was he jealous of Griggs?</p> 
<p>　　Well, that's what he might do then. He's always been a worthlessyoung cub. A rotten deal like this would be about his gait, Iguess.... Tell me, now: Why did he shoot Eddie Griggs?"There was coarseness a-plenty in the Inspector's pretense, but itpossessed a solitary fundamental virtue: it played on the heartof the woman whom he questioned, aroused it to wrath in defenseof her mate. In a second, all poise fled from this girl whosesoul was blossoming in the blest realization that a man loved herpurely, unselfishly. Her words came stumblingly in their haste.</p> 
<p>　　Her eyes were near to black in their anger.</p> 
<p>　　"He didn't kill him! He didn't kill him!" she fairly hissed.</p> 
<p>　　"Why, he's the most wonderful man in the world. You shan't hurthim! Nobody shall hurt him! I'll fight to the end of my life forDick Gilder!"Burke was beaming joyously. At last--a long last! --his finessehad won the victory over this woman's subtleties.</p> 
<p>　　"Well, that's just what I thought," he said, with smug content.</p> 
<p>　　"And now, then, who did shoot Griggs? We've got every one of thegang. They're all crooks. See here," he went on, with a suddenchange to the respectful in his manner, "why don't you startfresh? I'll give you every chance in the world. I'm dead on thelevel with you this time."But he was too late. By now, Mary had herself well in handagain, vastly ashamed of the short period of self-betrayal causedby the official's artifice against her heart. As she listened tothe Inspector's assurances, the mocking expression of her facewas not encouraging to that astute individual, but he perseveredmanfully.</p> 
<p>　　"Just you wait," he went on cheerfully, "and I'll prove to youthat I'm on the level about this, that I'm really your friend....</p> 
<p>　　There was a letter came for you to your apartment. My menbrought it down to me. I've read it. Here it is. I'll read itto you!"He picked up an envelope, which had been lying on the desk, anddrew out the single sheet of paper it contained. Mary watchedhim, wondering much more than her expression revealed over thisnew development. Then, as she listened, quick interest touchedher features to a new life. In her eyes leaped emotions to makeor mar a life.</p> 
<p>　　This was the letter:</p> 
<p>　　"I can't go without telling you how sorry I am. There won'tnever be a time that I won't remember it was me got you sent up,that you did time in my place. I ain't going to forgive myselfever, and I swear I'm going straight always.</p> 
<p>　　"Your true friend, "HELENMORRIS."For once, Burke showed a certain delicacy. When he had finishedthe reading, he said nothing for a long minute--only, sat withhis cunning eyes on the face of the woman who was immobile therebefore him. And, as he looked on her in her slender elegance ofform and gentlewomanly loveliness of face, a lovelinessintelligent and refined beyond that of most women, he felt bornein on his consciousness the fact that here was one to berespected. He fought against the impression. It was to himpreposterous, for she was one of that underworld against which hewas ruthlessly at war. Yet, he could not altogether overcome hisinstinct toward a half-reverent admiration.... And, as the letterproved, she had been innocent at the outset. She had been thevictim of a mistaken justice, made outcast by the law she hadnever wronged.... His mood of respect was inevitable, since hehad some sensibilities, though they were coarsened, and theysensed vaguely the maelstrom of emotions that now swirled in thegirl's breast.</p> 
<p>　　To Mary Turner, this was the wonderful hour. In it, thevindication of her innocence was made complete. The story wasthere recorded in black and white on the page written by HelenMorris. It mattered little--or infinitely much!--that it cametoo late. She had gained her evil place in the world, was anotorious woman in fact, was even now a prisoner under suspicionof murder. Nevertheless, she felt a thrill of ecstasy over thiswritten document--which it had never occurred to her to wrestfrom the girl at the time of the oral confession. Now that it hadbeen proffered, the value of it loomed above almost all thingselse in the world. It proclaimed undeniably the wrong underwhich she had suffered. She was not the thief the court hadadjudged her. Now, there's nobody here but just you and me. Comeon, now--put me wise!"Mary was again the resourceful woman who was glad to pit herbrain against the contriving of those who fought her. So, atthis moment, she seemed pliant to the will of the man who urgedher thus cunningly. Her quick glance around the office was of asort to delude the Inspector into a belief that she was yieldingto his lure.</p> 
<p>　　"Are you sure no one will ever know?" she asked, timorously.</p> 
<p>　　"Nobody but you and me," Burke declared, all agog withanticipation of victory at last. "I give you my word!"Mary met the gaze of the Inspector fully. In the same instant,she flashed on him a smile that was dazzling, the smile of awoman triumphant in her mastery of the situation. Her face wasradiant, luminous with honest mirth. There was something simpleand genuine in her beauty that thrilled the man before her, theman trying so vindictively to trap her to her own undoing. Forall his grossness, Burke was of shrewd perceptions, andsomewhere, half-submerged under the sordid nature of his calling,was a love of things esthetic, a responsiveness to the appeals ofbeauty. Now, as his glance searched the face of the girl who wasbubbling with mirth, he experienced an odd warming of his heartunder the spell of her loveliness--a loveliness wholly feminine,pervasive, wholesome. But, too, his soul shook in a premonitionof catastrophe, for there was mischief in the beaming eyes ofsoftest violet. There was a demon of mockery playing in thecurves of the scarlet lips, as she smiled so winsomely.</p> 
<p>　　All his apprehensions were verified by her utterance. It came ina most casual voice, despite the dancing delight in her face.</p> 
<p>　　The tones were drawled in the matter-of-fact fashion of statementthat leads a listener to answer without heed to the exact importof the question, unless very alert, indeed.... This is what shesaid in that so-casual voice:</p> 
<p>　　"I'm not speaking loud enough, am I, stenographer?"And that industrious writer of shorthand notes, absorbed in histask, answered instantly from his hidden place in the corridor.</p> 
<p>　　"No, ma'am, not quite."Mary laughed aloud, while Burke sat dumfounded. She rose swiftly,and went to the nearest window, and with a pull at the cord sentthe shade flying upward. For seconds, there was revealed the busystenographer, bent over his pad. Then, the noise of theascending shade, which had been hammering on his consciousness,penetrated, and he looked up. Realization came, as he beheld thewoman laughing at him through the window. Consternation besethim. He knew that, somehow, he had bungled fatally. A groan ofdistress burst from him, and he fled the place in ignominiousrout.</p> 
<p>　　There was another whose spirit was equally desirous offlight--Burke! Yet once again, he was beaten at his own game, hiscunning made of no avail against the clever interpretation ofthis woman whom he assailed. He had no defense to offer. He didnot care to meet her gaze just then, since he was learning torespect her as one wronged, where he had regarded her hithertomerely as of the flotsam and jetsam of the criminal class. So, heavoided her eyes as she stood by the window regarding himquizzically. In a panic of confusion quite new to him in hisyears of experience, he pressed the button on his desk.</p> 
<p>　　The doorman appeared with that automatic precision which made himvaluable in his position, and the Inspector hailed the readypresence with a feeling of profound relief.</p> 
<p>　　"Dan, take her back!" he said, feebly.</p> 
<p>　　Mary was smiling still as she went to the door. But she couldnot resist the impulse toward retort.</p> 
<p>　　"Oh, yes," she said, suavely; "you were right on the level withme, weren't you, Burke? Nobody here but you and me!" The wordscame in a sing-song of mockery.</p> 
<p>　　The Inspector had nothing in the way of answer--only, satmotionless until the door closed after her. Then, left alone, hissole audible comment was a single word--one he had learned,perhaps, from Aggie Lynch:</p> 
<p>　　"Hell!"</p>
