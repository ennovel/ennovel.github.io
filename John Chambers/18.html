THE SEMI-CENTENNIAL AND FAREWELL.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      When, like Ruth leaving her native land to dwell with Naomi—mother in love, as well as in law—John Chambers plighted his troth to the church that became orphan for his sake; he made Ruth's words his own, and in his heart said to his people: "The Lord do so to me and more also, if aught but death part thee and me."
<br> 
<br> For fifty years his one congregation was his first and only love. Deaf to all calls—and they were many—his one answer to his people was Ruth's to Naomi, and to those seeking him, the Shunammite's, "I dwell among mine own people." "How often have I heard him say," said Dr. Levy in 1875, "that though you could give him only a crust of bread and a cup of cold water, he would continue to be your pastor." Love begets love, and "unfailing confidence, tender sympathy and ardent love ... made this union enduring and fruitful of everything sweet and precious".
<br> 
<br> It was in the year 1875 that, after long preparation, the pastor's semi-centennial anniversary was celebrated. We here reproduce the programme as printed:

<br> 
<br> In a sermon marked by the usual graces of delivery, Dr. Chambers, as he was then, recounted in a touching manner the wonderful goodness of God enjoyed during a half century. He was surrounded by his church officers and congregation and his young alumni in the ministry. His old friend, Rev. Dr. T. J. Sheppard, with singular grace and power, preached from the fitting text: "He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither". Monday evening was devoted to epistolary communications or addresses by pastors who had formerly been members of the church, such as the Rev. Charles Brown, Rev. Dr. Levy, Rev. Joseph J. Baker, Rev. William J. Paxson, Rev. John C. Bliss, Rev. S. P. Kelley, and Rev. R. G. S. McNeille. Tuesday evening was for the participation of the Sunday School children in the jubilee service. On Wednesday evening the social reunion at Horticultural Hall took place, when besides the singing, led by Prof. William G.[143] Fisher, and appropriate words from Rev. Dr. Eva and Rev. William R. Stockton, Francis Newland, the life-long friend and elder of the church, presented in the name of the people a golden tribute in the form of one thousand dollars. One of his young men, John Wanamaker, on the eve of his departure for Europe, had the day before sent his pastor a five hundred dollar bill on the United States Treasury. The audience, numbering a thousand, after promenading and shaking hands with their beloved minister, partook of refreshments, each lady receiving a handsome memorial bouquet. On Thursday evening there was another feast of reason and flow of soul in the greetings by pastors of neighboring churches. Rev. George Dana Boardman was in the chair, and Rev. Dr. Breed, Rev. Dr. Newton, Dr. Hatfield, and William R. Stockton showed by word and look their love and fellowship. Dr. Breed, in the course of his address, read the following original lines:
<br> A stranger boy from Erin came—
<br> He made our land his chosen home.
<br> He heard the Master's gracious call,
<br> He seized the banner, climbed the wall,
<br> He blew the trumpet, drew the sword,
<br> He fired the shot, he preached the word
<br> By grace divine, thro' toils and tears,
<br> With ardent hopes, defying fears,
<br> In holy scorn of scoffs and jeers
<br> He's held the fort for fifty years!
<br> And if the God whom we adore,
<br> But grant what thousand hearts implore,
<br> He'll hold it yet for many more!
<br> Amen and amen!
<br> 
<br> The time honored Friday evening prayer meeting was held this week on May 14 in the upper auditorium and Rev.[144] Dr. Plumer of Columbia, S. C., and Rev. Charles Brown of Philadelphia made addresses.
<br> 
<br> It was at the "golden jubilee", as we have shown, that Dr. Chambers having on other occasions recounted the gifts of his people to their pastor—the furnishing of his house, the table set of silver, the expense money for a trip to Europe, the carpeting of his house, study and parlors by the ladies, the young people's birthday offering of $111 in gold pieces was treated to a fresh surprise, the "golden token"—one thousand dollars. In the grand old pastor's speech in response to his unexpected golden shower, he made it clear "what radiance it throws around this old man's evening of life".
<br> 
<br> Entering upon his seventy-eighth year, Dr. Chambers still kept up his abundant labors, though it was manifest, especially after the funerals of old and beloved parishioners and the great drain on his sympathies, that his powers were failing fast. In the month of August, 1875, he had an attack of paralysis of the bladder, which induced severe inflammation of the kidneys, resulting in blood poisoning, from which he died in his home, at Girard and Twelfth streets, after an illness of several weeks, at 11.15 P. M., September 22, 1875. It was on Communion Sunday, the last of the month, that asleep in God his mortal remains awaited their burial. His body was brought to the church, and thence from the spot where he had, a few weeks before, celebrated his golden anniversary. The last words uttered by him and set to music were sung by the quartet as the remains of John Chambers were taken from the church:
<br> "Farewell, farewell, farewell,
<br> We meet no more on this side of Heaven.
<br> Our parting scene is o'er,
<br> Our last fond look is given.
<br> Farewell, farewell, farewell."
<br> 
<br> [145]
<br> 
<br> I have copied these words as kindly contributed by one of the original quartet, Mr. A. Gunning.
<br> 
<br> Dr. Chambers died September 22, 1875, four months after his fiftieth anniversary. His successors in the pastorate have been Rev. Henry C. Westwood, D.D., 1876-1878; Rev. J. M. B. Otts, D.D., 1879-'83; Rev. Thomas A. Hoyt, D.D., 1884-1902. On this very day, June 30, as I finish revision of the manuscript to hand to the printer, July 1st, 1903, I read of his decease yesterday.
<br> 
<br> The executor of the estate of John Chambers, Robert H. Hinckley, Jr., attended to the settlement of the earthly affairs of his teacher and friend, including the distribution among his grandchildren of the pieces in the set of silver presented by the congregation in 1865.
<br> 
<br> In the central part of Laurel Hill Cemetery, in a small lot just off the main driveway, with four granite posts to mark the corners, is the very modest monument made of three blocks of granite, set one upon another, the whole indicative of solidity, strength and symmetry. The top piece is uninscribed. On the center piece one reads:
<br> 
<br> REV. JOHN CHAMBERS
<br> 
<br> "FOR FIFTY YEARS PASTOR OF CHAMBERS PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH,
<br> 
<br> Dec. 19, 1797.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sept. 22nd, 1875."
<br> 
<br> (On the ground block is inscribed,)
<br> 
<br> "They that turn many to righteousness shall shine as the stars forever and ever."
<br> 
<br> (On the other side, on same block with the name is:)
<br> 
<br> "I am the resurrection and the life."
<br> 
<br> "MATILDA P. CHAMBERS
<br> 
<br> Wife of Rev. John Chambers
<br> 
<br> Died March 4, 1877."
