Ever afterwards she preferred to think that it was just standing on the Wishing-rock and wishing and wishing!</p> 
<p>She had noticed, however, and had been a little curious, that every time Mr. John had come to Sunnyside he and her mother had talked and talked together in low tones so that, even when she was near them, she could not hear one word of what they were saying, and that, after these talks, her mother had been very pale and had, again and again, for no particular reason, hugged her very close and kissed her with what Jerry called a "sad" kiss.</p> 
<p>Then one afternoon Mrs. Allan had come with John Westley, and her mother, to her disgust, had sent her down to the Notch with a message for old Mrs. Teed that had not seemed a bit important. After her return John Westley had invited her to take him and Bigboy and Pepperpot to the Witches' Glade because, he said, he "had something to tell her!"</p> 
<p>It was a glorious afternoon. August was painting with her vivid coloring the mountain slopes and valleys; over everything was a soft glow. It was reflected on Jerry's eager face.</p> 
<p>John Westley pointed down into the valley where Jerry's "shining" road ran off out of sight. They could see an automobile, like a speck, moving swiftly along it.</p> 
<p>"Your road, down there, goes off the other side of the mountain and on and on and after a very long way--takes me back home. I'm going on Thursday."</p> 
<p>Jerry turned a disappointed face. Each day of John Westley's two weeks near Miller's Notch had brought immeasurable pleasure and excitement into her life.</p> 
<p>"Mrs. Allan is going to drive back with me--she lived in my town, you know. She hasn't been home for months and I shall enjoy her company."</p> 
<p>Jerry was staring at the distant road. After awhile the specks that were automobiles and that she liked to watch would become fewer and fewer; the days would grow colder, school would begin, the snow would come and choke the trails and she and Sweetheart and Little-Dad would be shut in at Sunnyside for weeks and weeks. Her face clouded.</p> 
<p>"And now listen very carefully, Jerry, and hold on to my arm so that you won't fall off from the mountain! You are going with us!"</p> 
<p>Jerry did hold on to his arm with a grip that hurt. She stared, with round, wondering eyes.</p> 
<p>He laughed at her unbelief. "Your wish is coming true! You're going to ride along that road yonder, in my automobile, which ought to get here to-morrow, straight around to the other side of the mountain, and on and on--then you're going to stay all winter with my own nieces and go to school with them----"</p> 
<p>Jerry's breath came in an excited gasp.</p> 
<p>"Oh, it can't--be--true! Mother'd never let me."</p> 
<p>"It is true! Mothers are always willing to do the things that are going to be best for their girls. Mrs. Allan and I have persuaded her----"</p> 
<p>But Jerry, with a "whoop," was racing down the trail, Bigboy and Pepperpot at her heels. She vaulted the little gate leading into the garden and swept like a small whirlwind upon her mother, sitting in the willow rocker on the porch. With a violent hug she tried to express the madness of her joy and so completely was her face hidden on her mother's shoulder that she did not see the quick tears that blinded her mother's eyes.</p> 
<p>That was on Monday--there were only three days to get her small wardrobe ready and packed and to ask the thousand questions concerning the Westley girls (Graham was utterly forgotten) and the school. Then there were wonderful, long talks with mother, sitting close by her side, one hand tight in hers--solemn talks that were to linger in Jerry's heart all her life.</p> 
<p>"I don't ever want to do anything, Mumsey Sweetheart, that'd make you the least little, little bit unhappy!" Jerry had said after one of these talks, suddenly pressing her mother's hand close to her cheek.</p> 
<p>On Wednesday afternoon she declared to Mr. John, when he drove over from Cobble, that she was "ready." She said it a little breathlessly--no Crusader of old, starting forth upon his holy way, felt any more exaltation of spirit than did Jerry!</p> 
<p>"I've packed and I've mended my coat and I've finished mother's comfy jacket that I began winter before last and I've said good-by to Rose and poor old Jimmy Chubb, who's awfully envious, 'cause he wanted to go to Troy to work in his uncle's store and he says it makes him mad to have a girl see the world 'fore he does, but I told him he ought to keep on at school, even if it was only Miller's Notch. And I've cleaned Little-Dad's pipes. And I've promised Bigboy and Pepperpot and Dormouse that they may all sleep on my bed to-night. I'm afraid Pepperpot--he's so sensitive--is going to miss me dreadfully!" Jerry tried to frown away the thought; she did not want it to intrude upon her joy.</p> 
<p>That last evening she sat quietly on the porch with one hand in her mother's and the other in Little-Dad's. Not one of them seemed to want to talk; Jerry was too excited and her mother knew that she could not keep a tremble from her voice. At nine o'clock Jerry declared that she'd just have to go to bed so that the morning would come quicker. She kissed them both, kissed her mother again and again, then marched off with her pets at her heels.</p> 
<p>Far into the night her mother sat alone on the edge of the porch, staring at the stars through a mist of tears and praying--first that the Heavenly Father would protect her little Jerry always and always, and then that He would give her strength to let the child go on the morrow.</p> 
<p>When the parting came everyone tried to be very busy and very merry, to cover the heartache that was under it all; John Westley fussed with the covers and the cushions in the big car and had his chauffeur pack and repack the bags. Mrs. Allan and Mrs. Travis discussed the lunch that had been stowed away in the tonneau, as though the whole thing was only a day's picnic. Jerry, a funny little figure in her coat that was too small and a fall hat that Mrs. Chubb had made over from one of her mother's, was, with careful impartiality, bestowing final caresses upon Bigboy, Pepperpot, Silverheels, and her father and mother alike. Then, at the last moment, she almost strangled her mother with a sweep of her strong young arms.</p> 
<p>"Mumsey Sweetheart, if you want me dreadfully--you'll send for me," she whispered, stricken for a moment by the realization that the parting was for a very long time.</p> 
<p>Then, though her heart was almost breaking within her, Mrs. Travis managed to laugh lightly.</p> 
<p>"Need you--of course we won't need you! Climb in, darling," and she almost lifted the girl into the tonneau, where Mrs. Allan was already comfortably fixed.</p> 
<p>But at this moment Bigboy tried to leap into the car. When Dr. Travis gripped his collar he let out a long, protesting howl.</p> 
<p>"Oh, Bigboy--he knows! Let me say good-by again," cried Jerry, jumping out and, to everyone's amusement, embracing the dog.</p> 
<p>"You must be a good dog and take very good care of my Sweetheart and Little-Dad," she whispered. Then, standing, she looked around.</p> 
<p>"Where's Pepperpot?" she asked anxiously. The little dog had disappeared.</p> 
<p>"He'll think that I love Bigboy more than I do him," she explained, as she climbed back in.</p> 
<p>The car started down the rough road. Jerry turned to wave; as long as she could see her mother and father she kept her little white handkerchief fluttering. Then she faced resolutely forward.</p> 
<p>"You know," she explained to John Westley, with shining eyes, "when you've been wishing and wishing for something, you must enjoy it as hard as you can."</p> 
<p>Even the familiar buildings of the Notch seemed different now to Jerry, as she flew past them, and she kept finding new things all along the way. Then, as they turned from the rough country road into her "shining" road, which was, of course, the macadam highway, she looked back and up toward Kettle to see if she could catch a glimpse of Sunnyside or the Witches' Glade and the Wishing-rock. They were lost in a blaze of green and purple and brown.</p> 
<p>"Isn't it funny? If I was up there watching I'd see you moving like a speck! And in a moment you'd disappear around the corner. And now I'm the speck and--I don't know when we reach the corner. But I'm--going, anyway!"</p> 
<p>Then upon her happy meditations came a sudden, startling interruption in the shape of a small dog that leaped out from the dense undergrowth at the side of the road and hailed the automobile with a sharp bark.</p> 
<p>"Pepperpot!" cried Jerry, springing to her feet.</p> 
<p>The chauffeur had brought the car to a sudden stop to avoid hitting the dog. At the sound of Jerry's voice the little animal made a joyous leap into the car.</p> 
<p>"He came on ahead--through the Divide! Oh--the darling," and Jerry hugged her pet proudly.</p> 
<p>John Westley looked at Penelope Allan and she looked at him and the chauffeur looked at them both--all with the same question. In Jerry's mind, however, there was no doubt.</p> 
<p>"He'll have to go with us, Mr. John, because I know he'd just die of a broken heart if I--took him back!"</p> 
<p>Then, startled by John Westley's hesitation, she added convincingly, "He's awfully good and never bothers anyone and keeps as still as can be when I tell him to and I'll--I'll----"</p> 
<p>No one could have resisted the appeal in her voice.</p> 
<p>"Very well, Jerry--Pepperpot shall go, too."</p>
