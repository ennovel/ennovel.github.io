Colia followed him almost at once, anxious to do what he could to console him. The poor boy seemed to be already so attached to him that he could hardly leave him.</p> 
<p>"You were quite right to go away!" he said. "The row will rage there worse than ever now; and it's like this every day with us-- and all through that Nastasia Philipovna."</p> 
<p>"You have so many sources of trouble here, Colia," said the prince.</p> 
<p>"Yes, indeed, and it is all our own fault. But I have a great friend who is much worse off even than we are. Would you like to know him?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, very much. Is he one of your school-fellows?"</p> 
<p>"Well, not exactly. I will tell you all about him some day. . . . What do you think of Nastasia Philipovna? She is beautiful, isn't she? I had never seen her before, though I had a great wish to do so. She fascinated me. I could forgive Gania if he were to marry her for love, but for money! Oh dear! that is horrible!"</p> 
<p>"Yes, your brother does not attract me much."</p> 
<p>"I am not surprised at that. After what you ... But I do hate that way of looking at things! Because some fool, or a rogue pretending to be a fool, strikes a man, that man is to be dishonoured for his whole life, unless he wipes out the disgrace with blood, or makes his assailant beg forgiveness on his knees! I think that so very absurd and tyrannical. Lermontoff's Bal Masque is based on that idea--a stupid and unnatural one, in my opinion; but he was hardly more than a child when he wrote it."</p> 
<p>"I like your sister very much."</p> 
<p>"Did you see how she spat in Gania's face! Varia is afraid of no one. But you did not follow her example, and yet I am sure it was not through cowardice. Here she comes! Speak of a wolf and you see his tail! I felt sure that she would come. She is very generous, though of course she has her faults."</p> 
<p>Varia pounced upon her brother.</p> 
<p>"This is not the place for you," said she. "Go to father. Is he plaguing you, prince?"</p> 
<p>"Not in the least; on the contrary, he interests me."</p> 
<p>"Scolding as usual, Varia! It is the worst thing about her. After all, I believe father may have started off with Rogojin. No doubt he is sorry now. Perhaps I had better go and see what he is doing," added Colia, running off.</p> 
<p>"Thank God, I have got mother away, and put her to bed without another scene! Gania is worried--and ashamed--not without reason! What a spectacle! I have come to thank you once more, prince, and to ask you if you knew Nastasia Philipovna before</p> 
<p>"No, I have never known her."</p> 
<p>"Then what did you mean, when you said straight out to her that she was not really 'like that'? You guessed right, I fancy. It is quite possible she was not herself at the moment, though I cannot fathom her meaning. Evidently she meant to hurt and insult us. I have heard curious tales about her before now, but if she came to invite us to her house, why did she behave so to my mother? Ptitsin knows her very well; he says he could not understand her today. With Rogojin, too! No one with a spark of self-respect could have talked like that in the house of her... Mother is extremely vexed on your account, too...</p> 
<p>"That is nothing!" said the prince, waving his hand.</p> 
<p>"But how meek she was when you spoke to her!"</p> 
<p>"Meek! What do you mean?"</p> 
<p>"You told her it was a shame for her to behave so, and her manner changed at once; she was like another person. You have some influence over her, prince," added Varia, smiling a little.</p> 
<p>The door opened at this point, and in came Gania most unexpectedly.</p> 
<p>He was not in the least disconcerted to see Varia there, but he stood a moment at the door, and then approached the prince quietly.</p> 
<p>"Prince," he said, with feeling, "I was a blackguard. Forgive me!" His face gave evidence of suffering. The prince was considerably amazed, and did not reply at once. "Oh, come, forgive me, forgive me!" Gania insisted, rather impatiently. "If you like, I'll kiss your hand. There!"</p> 
<p>The prince was touched; he took Gania's hands, and embraced him heartily, while each kissed the other.</p> 
<p>"I never, never thought you were like that," said Muishkin, drawing a deep breath. "I thought you--you weren't capable of--"</p> 
<p>"Of what? Apologizing, eh? And where on earth did I get the idea that you were an idiot? You always observe what other people pass by unnoticed; one could talk sense to you, but--"</p> 
<p>"Here is another to whom you should apologize," said the prince, pointing to Varia.</p> 
<p>"No, no! they are all enemies! I've tried them often enough, believe me," and Gania turned his back on Varia with these words.</p> 
<p>"But if I beg you to make it up?" said Varia.</p> 
<p>"And you'll go to Nastasia Philipovna's this evening--"</p> 
<p>"If you insist: but, judge for yourself, can I go, ought I to go?"</p> 
<p>"But she is not that sort of woman, I tell you!" said Gania, angrily. "She was only acting."</p> 
<p>"I know that--I know that; but what a part to play! And think what she must take YOU for, Gania! I know she kissed mother's hand, and all that, but she laughed at you, all the same. All this is not good enough for seventy-five thousand roubles, my dear boy. You are capable of honourable feelings still, and that's why I am talking to you so. Oh! DO take care what you are doing! Don't you know yourself that it will end badly, Gania?"</p> 
<p>So saying, and in a state of violent agitation, Varia left the room.</p> 
<p>"There, they are all like that," said Gania, laughing, "just as if I do not know all about it much better than they do."</p> 
<p>He sat down with these words, evidently intending to prolong his visit.</p> 
<p>"If you know it so well," said the prince a little timidly, "why do you choose all this worry for the sake of the seventy-five thousand, which, you confess, does not cover it?"</p> 
<p>"I didn't mean that," said Gania; "but while we are upon the subject, let me hear your opinion. Is all this worry worth seventy-five thousand or not?</p> 
<p>"Certainly not."</p> 
<p>"Of course! And it would be a disgrace to marry so, eh?"</p> 
<p>"A great disgrace."</p> 
<p>"Oh, well, then you may know that I shall certainly do it, now. I shall certainly marry her. I was not quite sure of myself before, but now I am. Don't say a word: I know what you want to tell me--"</p> 
<p>"No. I was only going to say that what surprises me most of all is your extraordinary confidence."</p> 
<p>"How so? What in?"</p> 
<p>"That Nastasia Philipovna will accept you, and that the question is as good as settled; and secondly, that even if she did, you would be able to pocket the money. Of course, I know very little about it, but that's my view. When a man marries for money it often happens that the wife keeps the money in her own hands."</p> 
<p>"Of course, you don't know all; but, I assure you, you needn't be afraid, it won't be like that in our case. There are circumstances," said Gania, rather excitedly. "And as to her answer to me, there's no doubt about that. Why should you suppose she will refuse me?"</p> 
<p>"Oh, I only judge by what I see. Varvara Ardalionovna said just now--"</p> 
<p>"Oh she--they don't know anything about it! Nastasia was only chaffing Rogojin. I was alarmed at first, but I have thought better of it now; she was simply laughing at him. She looks on me as a fool because I show that I meant her money, and doesn't realize that there are other men who would deceive her in far worse fashion. I'm not going to pretend anything, and you'll see she'll marry me, all right. If she likes to live quietly, so she shall; but if she gives me any of her nonsense, I shall leave her at once, but I shall keep the money. I'm not going to look a fool; that's the first thing, not to look a fool."</p> 
<p>"But Nastasia Philipovna seems to me to be such a SENSIBLE woman, and, as such, why should she run blindly into this business? That's what puzzles me so," said the prince.</p> 
<p>"You don't know all, you see; I tell you there are things--and besides, I'm sure that she is persuaded that I love her to distraction, and I give you my word I have a strong suspicion that she loves me, too--in her own way, of course. She thinks she will be able to make a sort of slave of me all my life; but I shall prepare a little surprise for her. I don't know whether I ought to be confidential with you, prince; but, I assure you, you are the only decent fellow I have come across. I have not spoken so sincerely as I am doing at this moment for years. There are uncommonly few honest people about, prince; there isn't one honester than Ptitsin, he's the best of the lot. Are you laughing? You don't know, perhaps, that blackguards like honest people, and being one myself I like you. WHY am I a blackguard? Tell me honestly, now. They all call me a blackguard because of her, and I have got into the way of thinking myself one. That's what is so bad about the business."</p> 
<p>"I for one shall never think you a blackguard again," said the prince. "I confess I had a poor opinion of you at first, but I have been so joyfully surprised about you just now; it's a good lesson for me. I shall never judge again without a thorough trial. I see now that you are riot only not a blackguard, but are not even quite spoiled. I see that you are quite an ordinary man, not original in the least degree, but rather weak."</p> 
<p>Gania laughed sarcastically, but said nothing. The prince, seeing that he did not quite like the last remark, blushed, and was silent too.</p> 
<p>"Has my father asked you for money?" asked Gania, suddenly.</p> 
<p>"No."</p> 
<p>"Don't give it to him if he does. Fancy, he was a decent, respectable man once! He was received in the best society; he was not always the liar he is now. Of course, wine is at the bottom of it all; but he is a good deal worse than an innocent liar now. Do you know that he keeps a mistress? I can't understand how mother is so long-sufferring. Did he tell you the story of the siege of Kars? Or perhaps the one about his grey horse that talked? He loves, to enlarge on these absurd histories." And Gania burst into a fit of laughter. Suddenly he turned to the prince and asked: "Why are you looking at me like that?"</p> 
<p>"I am surprised to see you laugh in that way, like a child. You came to make friends with me again just now, and you said, 'I will kiss your hand, if you like,' just as a child would have said it. And then, all at once you are talking of this mad project--of these seventy-five thousand roubles! It all seems so absurd and impossible."</p> 
<p>"Well, what conclusion have you reached?"</p> 
<p>"That you are rushing madly into the undertaking, and that you would do well to think it over again. It is more than possible that Varvara Ardalionovna is right."</p> 
<p>"Ah! now you begin to moralize! I know that I am only a child, very well," replied Gania impatiently. "That is proved by my having this conversation with you. It is not for money only, prince, that I am rushing into this affair," he continued, hardly master of his words, so closely had his vanity been touched. "If I reckoned on that I should certainly be deceived, for I am still too weak in mind and character. I am obeying a passion, an impulse perhaps, because I have but one aim, one that overmasters all else. You imagine that once I am in possession of these seventy-five thousand roubles, I shall rush to buy a carriage... No, I shall go on wearing the old overcoat I have worn for three years, and I shall give up my club. I shall follow the example of men who have made their fortunes. When Ptitsin was seventeen he slept in the street, he sold pen-knives, and began with a copeck; now he has sixty thousand roubles, but to get them, what has he not done? Well, I shall be spared such a hard beginning, and shall start with a little capital. In fifteen years people will say, 'Look, that's Ivolgin, the king of the Jews!' You say that I have no originality. Now mark this, prince-- there is nothing so offensive to a man of our time and race than to be told that he is wanting in originality, that he is weak in character, has no particular talent, and is, in short, an ordinary person. You have not even done me the honour of looking upon me as a rogue. Do you know, I could have knocked you down for that just now! You wounded me more cruelly than Epanchin, who thinks me capable of selling him my wife! Observe, it was a perfectly gratuitous idea on his part, seeing there has never been any discussion of it between us! This has exasperated me, and I am determined to make a fortune! I will do it! Once I am rich, I shall be a genius, an extremely original man. One of the vilest and most hateful things connected with money is that it can buy even talent; and will do so as long as the world lasts. You will say that this is childish--or romantic. Well, that will be all the better for me, but the thing shall be done. I will carry it through. He laughs most, who laughs last. Why does Epanchin insult me? Simply because, socially, I am a nobody. However, enough for the present. Colia has put his nose in to tell us dinner is ready, twice. I'm dining out. I shall come and talk to you now and then; you shall be comfortable enough with us. They are sure to make you one of the family. I think you and I will either be great friends or enemies. Look here now, supposing I had kissed your hand just now, as I offered to do in all sincerity, should I have hated you for it afterwards?"</p> 
<p>"Certainly, but not always. You would not have been able to keep it up, and would have ended by forgiving me," said the prince, after a pause for reflection, and with a pleasant smile.</p> 
<p>"Oho, how careful one has to be with you, prince! Haven't you put a drop of poison in that remark now, eh? By the way--ha, ha, ha!-- I forgot to ask, was I right in believing that you were a good deal struck yourself with Nastasia Philipovna</p> 
<p>"Ye-yes."</p> 
<p>"Are you in love with her?"</p> 
<p>"N-no."</p> 
<p>"And yet you flush up as red as a rosebud! Come--it's all right. I'm not going to laugh at you. Do you know she is a very virtuous woman? Believe it or not, as you like. You think she and Totski-- not a bit of it, not a bit of it! Not for ever so long! Au revoir!"</p> 
<p>Gania left the room in great good humour. The prince stayed behind, and meditated alone for a few minutes. At length, Colia popped his head in once more.</p> 
<p>"I don't want any dinner, thanks, Colia. I had too good a lunch at General Epanchin's."</p> 
<p>Colia came into the room and gave the prince a note; it was from the general and was carefully sealed up. It was clear from Colia's face how painful it was to him to deliver the missive. The prince read it, rose, and took his hat.</p> 
<p>"It's only a couple of yards," said Colia, blushing.</p> 
<p>"He's sitting there over his bottle--and how they can give him credit, I cannot understand. Don't tell mother I brought you the note, prince; I have sworn not to do it a thousand times, but I'm always so sorry for him. Don't stand on ceremony, give him some trifle, and let that end it."</p> 
<p>"Come along, Colia, I want to see your father. I have an idea," said the prince.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>公爵走出会客室，关上门呆在自己房间里。科利亚马上跑到他这儿来安慰他。可怜的男孩现在似乎已经离不开他了。</p> 
<p>“您走开了，这样好，”他说，“那里现在比刚才更乱，我们这儿每天都是这样，全都是因为这个纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜惹出麻烦来的。”</p> 
<p>“你们这儿郁结和沉积着各种各样的事情，科利亚，”公爵指出道。</p> 
<p>“是的，积多了。关于我们甚至没什么好说的。一切都咎由自取。而我还有一位好朋友，这个人还要不幸。您愿意我给您介绍认识吗？”</p> 
<p>“很愿意。是您同学？”</p> 
<p>“是的，几乎是同学。我以后再对您讲清楚这一切……那么纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜漂亮吗，您认为怎么样？在此以前我还从没有看见过她，但是非常想见得不得了。她简直美丽惊人。假如加尼卡是出于爱情，我就会全都原谅他的。可他为什么要拿钱，这就糟了！”</p> 
<p>“是的，我不大喜欢您的兄长。”</p> 
<p>“嗯，这还用说！在那样的事以后，您当然……要知道，我不能忍受形形色色的世俗偏见。一个疯子或者傻瓜，或者恶棍，在发疯的状态下打了人一记耳光，于是这个人一辈子就被玷污了，除了用血，或者人家跪着向他请求宽恕，他是怎么也不能洗刷自己了。据我看，这是荒谬的，是霸道，菜蒙托衣的剧本《假面舞会》写的正是这个，我认为，这很愚蠢。也就是，我想说，极不自然。可是他几乎还是在童年时代就写了该剧的。”</p> 
<p>“我很喜欢您的姐姐。”</p> 
<p>“她突然朝加尼卡那张鬼脸啤了一口。真是个勇敢的瓦里卡！可您却没有那样唾他，我深信，并不是因为没有勇气。瞧，说到她，她自己就来了，我知道她要来的：她是个高尚的人，虽然也有缺点。”</p> 
<p>“这儿没你的事，”瓦里娅首先冲着他说，“到父亲那儿陆。公爵，他没让你讨嫌吧？”</p> 
<p>“完全不是，恰恰相反。”</p> 
<p>“瞧，姐姐，又开始了：她就是这点不好。恰好我也在想，父亲也许会跟罗戈任走的。现在想必在后悔了。去看看，他到底怎么样，”科利亚出去时补了一句。</p> 
<p>“谢天谢地，我把妈妈带开了，让她躺下了。没有再发生什么。加尼亚非常窘困，深深陷于沉恩。也确实有些事情该好好想想。多大的教训哟！……我来是再次感谢您，并且想问，公爵，在此以前您不认识纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜吧？”</p> 
<p>“是的，不认识。”</p> 
<p>“那么您凭什么当面对她说，她‘不是这样的’，好像您还猜对了。看来，也许她真的不是这样的人。不过，我弄不懂她！当然，她是怀着侮辱人的目的来的，这是明摆着的。我在过去就听说过有关她的许多奇闻轶事。但是，既然她来是邀我们，那么开始又是怎么对待妈妈的呢？普季岑对她很了解，可是他说，他也猜不透她刚才的行为。而对罗戈任的态度呢？如果自重的话，是不能这样说话的，又是在她的……妈妈也很不放心您。”</p> 
<p>“没什么！”公爵说着，挥了一下手。</p> 
<p>“她怎么会听您的……”</p> 
<p>“听什么？”</p> 
<p>“您对她说，她应该害臊，她就一下子全变了。您对她有影响，公爵，”瓦里娅微微一笑，补充着说。</p> 
<p>门开了，完全出乎意料，进来的是加尼亚。</p> 
<p>看见瓦里娅时，他甚至也没有动摇；他在门口站了一会，突然毅然走近公爵。</p> 
<p>“公爵，我的行为很卑鄙，请原谅我，亲爱的，”他突然怀着强烈的感情说着，脸上流露出剧烈的痛苦。公爵惊愕地望着他，没有马上回答。“好吧，原谅我，好吧，原谅我吧！”加尼亚迫不及待地坚持着，“好吧，您愿意的话，我马上吻您的手！”</p> 
<p>公爵十分惊讶，默默地用双手拥抱加尼亚。两人真挚地亲吻着。</p> 
<p>“我无论如何，无论如何也想不到，您是这样的人，”公爵吃力地换一口气，终于说道，“我以为，您……是做不到的。”</p> 
<p>“做不到认错？……不久前我怎么会认为您是白痴呢！您能发觉别人从来也不会发觉的东西。跟您是可以谈谈的，但是……最好还是别说。”</p> 
<p>“您还得向一个人认错，”公爵指着瓦里娅说。</p> 
<p>“不，这可仍是我的敌人。，您请相信，公爵，曾经做过许多尝试；这里的人是不会真诚地原谅人的！”加尼亚急躁地脱口而出，他背朝瓦里娅，向一边转过身去。</p> 
<p>“不，我会原谅的！“”突然瓦里娅说。</p> 
<p>“那你晚上将去纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜那里吗？”</p> 
<p>“如果你要我去，我就去，只不过最好你还是自己想一想：我现在是否还有那么一点可能性去她那里？”</p> 
<p>“她可不是这样的人，你也看见了，她总是出一些谜让人去猜！这是耍花招！”加尼亚忿忿地笑了起来。</p> 
<p>“我自己也知道、她不是这样的人，是在耍花招，可耍的是什么花招呢；还有，加尼亚，留点神，她自己把你看作什么人？就算她吻了妈妈的手。这算这是什么花招，但她毕竟是嘲笑了你！这可不值七万五千卢布，真的，哥哥！你还能有高尚的感情，因此我才对你说这些。咳，你自己也别去了，咳，当心点！这不会有好下场！”</p> 
<p>瓦里娅说完这些话，非常激动，很快地走出了房间……</p> 
<p>“瞧他们全都这样！”加尼亚苦笑着说，“难道他们以为，我自己不知道这一点？我可比他们知道多得多。”</p> 
<p>说完这话，加尼亚坐到沙发上，看来是想继续这次拜访。</p> 
<p>“既然您自己知道，”公爵相当羞怯地问，“明明知道，实际上不值得为了七万五千卢布而去承受痛苦，又为什么要选择这种痛苦呢？”</p> 
<p>“我说的不是这个，”加尼亚喃喃说，“正好，请告诉我，我正想知道您的意见，这个痛苦是否值七万五千卢布，您认为如何？”</p> 
<p>“据我看，是不值的。”</p> 
<p>“嗨，我早知道您会这么说。这样结婚是可耻的？”</p> 
<p>“非常可耻。”</p> 
<p>“好吧，那么您要知道，我要结婚了，现在已经是非结婚不可了。刚才我还在犹豫，可现在已经不动摇了！您别说了！我知道您想说的话……”</p> 
<p>“我要说的不是您所想的。您这种非同寻常的信心使我感到惊讶……”</p> 
<p>“对什么有信心？什么信心？”</p> 
<p>“相信纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜一定会嫁给您，相信这一切已经了结，其次，就算她嫁给您，您相信七万五千卢布就这样直接到您口袋里。不过，我当然不知道其中的许多事情。”</p> 
<p>加尼亚猛的向公爵这边移近来。</p> 
<p>“当然，您不全知道，”他说，“再说凭什么我要承受这全部重负呢？”</p> 
<p>“我觉得，到处都会发生这样的事：为了钱而结婚，而钱则在妻子那里。”</p> 
<p>“不，我们不会这样……这里……这里有一些情况……”加尼亚惊惶不安和若有所思地低语说，“至于说她的回答，那已不必怀疑，”他很快补充说，“您根据什么得出结论，她会拒绝我？”</p> 
<p>“除了我所看见的，我什么也不知道；刚才瓦尔瓦拉·阿尔达利翁诺夫娜已经说了……”</p> 
<p>“哎！他们就是这样，不知道该说什么。而纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜嘲笑的是罗戈任，请相信，这点我看得很清楚。这是看得出来的。我刚才还害怕，而现在我看清楚了。也许，您是指她对母亲、父亲以及瓦里娅的态度。”</p> 
<p>“还有对您的态度。”</p> 
<p>“也许是；但这是女人报复的老一套手段，没有别的名堂。这是个非常爱发脾气、疑神疑鬼和自尊心强的女人，就像没有提升晋级的官僚一样！她是想显示一下自己，想表现出自己对他们的轻蔑……当然，也包括对我；这是真的，我不否认……但她反正会嫁给我的。您甚至都想不到，人的自尊心能驱使去耍任何花招：她认为我是卑鄙小人，因为我竟公然为了她的钱而娶她这个别人的情妇，可是她却不知道，换了另一个人会更卑鄙地欺骗她，先是纠缠她，开始向她散布自由主义的进步思想，还会搬出各种妇女问题，这样她就舍像一根线似的整个儿穿进了他那个针眼了。他会使这个自尊心强的傻女人相信（这是非常容易的！），他仅仅是为了‘她那高尚的心灵和不幸’，才娶她的，而自己则仍然是为了钱而娶她的。这里的人不喜欢我，因为我不想耍滑头；可是却应该这样。而她自己在干什么？还不就是那么一回事，既然这样，她又为什么瞧不起我，还要玩这一套？就因为我自己不想屈服，并且要表现出我的高傲。好了，我们瞧吧！”</p> 
<p>“莫非在这以前您爱过她？”</p> 
<p>“开始我爱过。嘿，还相当爱……有一种女人是只适合做情妇’的，别的没有什么用处。我不是说，她曾经做过我的情妇。如果她想太太平平过日子，我也就安安稳稳生活；如果她要生事造反，我马上就甩掉她，但是钱可要抓在自己手里。我不想成为笑柄；首先就是不想成为笑柄。</p> 
<p>“我始终觉得，”公爵小心谨慎地指出，“纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜是个聪明人，她预感到这种痛苦，又为何要往圈套里钻呢？她可是能够嫁给别人的。这就是令我感到惊奇的。”</p> 
<p>“这里就有她的用意！您不了解这里面的全部情况，公爵……这里面……此外，她确信我爱她爱得发狂，我向您发誓，知道吗，我坚定地料想，她是爱我的，不过是用她那种方式，您知道有句俗话说：‘打是爱来骂是俏。’她一辈子都会把我看作一张无足轻重的方块Ａ（也许，这正是她所需要的）并且还要按她那方式来爱我；她就准备这样于，她就是这样的性格呗。我要告诉您，她是个非同寻常的俄罗斯妇女；不过，我也为她准备了意想不到的礼物。刚才跟瓦里娅之间的斗嘴是出乎意料的，但是对我是有利的：她现在看见了并且确信我对她是忠诚的，也看到了，为了她我断绝了一切关系。这就是说，我们也不是傻瓜，请相信。顺便说，您是否认为我是个多嘴的人？亲爱的公爵，也许，我把活都告诉您，这样做真的不好。但是正因为您是我碰到的第一个高尚的人，我才冲着您来，说确切些，您别把‘冲’字当作双关语。您对刚才的事可是不生气了，是吧？在整整两年中，。我也许还是第一次说心里话。这里正直的人大少了；没有比普季岑更正直的人。怎么，您好像在笑，是不是？卑鄙小人喜欢正直的人，--您不知道这一点吧？可我倒是……不过，请凭良心对我说，哪一点上我卑鄙了？为什么他们全都跟着她称我是卑鄙小人？要知道，跟着他们，跟着她，我自己也要称自己是卑鄙小人了！反正什么是卑鄙的就是卑鄙的！”</p> 
<p>“我现在已经再也不认为您是卑鄙小人了，”公爵说，“刚才我已经完全把您看作是恶棍，可突然您使我感到很高兴，这也是一次教训：没有经验就别作判断。现在我明白，不仅不能认为您是恶棍，也不能把您看作是十分堕落的人。据我看，您是所能见到的最平常不过的人，除了很瘦弱，没有丝毫特别的地方。”</p> 
<p>加尼亚暗自苦笑了一下，仍然沉默着。公爵看到，他的意见并不受欢迎，因此有些尴尬，也就闭口不言了。</p> 
<p>“父亲向您要钱了吗？”加尼亚突然问。</p> 
<p>“没有。”</p> 
<p>“他会要的，请您别给；他过去倒还是个很体面的人，我还记得。一些有身份的人家都让他进去的。可他们．所有这些体面的老人多么快就销声匿迹了！只要情势稍有变化，昔日的一切就荡然无存，犹如烟消云散一般。他过去是不撒谎的，我请您相信；过去他只是个过于激动热情的人，结果就落得这般地步！当然，酒是罪魁祸首。您知道他养情妇吗？他现在已经不只是个无辜的撒谎者了。我不能理解母亲怎么会长期容忍他。他对您讲过进攻卡尔斯的事吗？或者讲他那匹拉边套伪灰马怎么讲起话来的？他甚至已经到这种地步了。”</p> 
<p>加尼亚突然纵声大笑起来。</p> 
<p>“您干嘛这样看着我。”他问公爵。</p> 
<p>“您这样由衷地发笑，我很惊奇。真的，您还保留着孩童般的笑声。刚才您进来讲和并说：‘愿意吗，我吻您的手，’这就像孩子讲话一个样。这么说，您还能说这样的话和做这样的行为。而且您突然开始滔滔不绝他讲起这件见不得人的事和七万五千卢布来，真的，这一切似乎是荒谬的，不可能的。”</p> 
<p>“您想从中得出什么结论呢？”</p> 
<p>“结论是，您这样做是否太轻率？您是否应该首先审慎地斟酌一下？瓦尔瓦拉·阿尔达利翁诺夫娜也许说的是对的。”</p> 
<p>“哦，道德说教，至于我不是个毛头小伙子，这我自己也知道，”加尼亚急切地打断地说，“就因为这一点，我才跟您进行这样的谈话。公爵，我去干这见不得人的事并非出于精明的盘算，”他宛如一个自尊心受到伤害的年轻人，不停地说，“在精明运算方面我大概是会犯错误的，因为我的头脑和性格都还不坚定。我是出于激情、出于倾慕才这么干的，因为我有一个主要的目标。您会以为，我得到七万五千卢布，马上就买一辆马车。不，我将把前年就穿的旧外套穿到不能再穿，要跟所有那些俱乐部里的熟人不再来往。我们虽然都是高利革者，但其中很少有能经受考验的人，可我想经受住。这里主要的是要把事情进行到底--这便是全部任务！普季岑１７岁时睡在马路上，卖过铅笔刀，从一个戈比起的家；现在他有６万，当然这只是在吃了许多苦头后才达到这一步的！可现在我将一步跳过这些苦头，直接就可从有资本做起；再过１５年人家就会说‘瞧伊沃尔金，犹太人之王。，“您对我说，我这个人没有什么特别的地方。请您注意，亲爱的公爵，没有什么会使我们这个时代和我们这种出身的人更感到屈辱了。这就是对他说，他没有什么独特的地方，性格软弱，没有特别的才能，是个平庸的人。您甚至没有赏脸把我看作是个出色的卑鄙小人，知道吗，我刚才真想为此把您吃了！您比叶潘钦侮辱我更甚，他认为我是个能把妻子出卖给他的人（无须商谈，不用诱惑，就凭我天生少心眼，请注意这点））老兄，这点早就把我气疯了，可是我要钱。等我积够了钱，我就会是个与众大大不同的人。金钱最卑鄙最可恨的地方，就在于它甚至能赋予才干。并且这将直至世界未日。您会说，这一切像是孩子说的话，或者也许是非非之想，那也罢，我却会因此而觉得更快活，事业反正一定要办成。我要进行到底并且坚持下去。Ｒｌｒａ ｂｌｅｎ ｑｕｉ ｎｉｎａ ｌｅ ｄｅｒｎｉｅｒ！＊叶潘钦为什么这样侮辱我？是因为仇恨吗？从来也没有过。不过是因为我是个微不足道、无足轻重的人。嘿，到那时……不过，话说够了，该走了。科利亚已经两次探鼻子进来了：他这是来叫您去用午餐。我则要出去。有时候我会顺便来看看您，在我们家您会觉得不错的；现在简直就把您当自己人了。小心，别出卖我。我觉得，我与您或者是朋友，或者成敌人。公爵，假如我刚才吻了您的手（我是多么真诚地自愿表示这样做），以后我会因此成为您的敌人吗，您怎么想？”</p> 
<p>“一定会的，只不过不会永久是敌人，以后会忍不住和原谅的，”公爵想了一下，笑了起来，决然说。</p> 
<p>“嗨！对您真应该多加小心。鬼知道，您在这里也灌进了毒液。谁又知道，也许，您就是我的敌人？这是随便说说的，哈一哈！我忘了问：您似乎过分喜欢纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜了，我的感觉对不对，啊？”</p> 
<p>“是的……喜欢。”</p> 
<p>“爱上了？”</p> 
<p>“不。”</p> 
<p>“可却满脸通红，一副苦相。算了，没关系，没关系，我不会笑话的；再见。不过您要知道，她可是个道德高尚的女人，您能相信这点吗？您以为，她现在跟那个人，跟托茨基同居？决没有。而且已经是很久前的事了。您注意到没有，她本人是个非常怕难为情的人，刚才有一会还挺尴尬？真的。就是这种人偏喜欢摆布别人，好了，告辞了！”</p> 
<p>加涅奇卡比进来时要放松得多，心情挺好地走了出去，有１０分钟光景公爵一动不动地呆着并想着什么。</p> 
<p>科利亚又把头伸进门来。</p> 
<p>＊法语：谁笑得最晚，准则笑得最好。</p> 
<p>“我不想用午餐，科利亚；我刚才在叶潘钦家早餐吃得很饱。”</p> 
<p>科利亚完全走进门来，递给公爵一张便条。它是将军写来的，折叠着并加了封。从科利亚的脸色可以看出，传递便条令他非常苦恼。公爵看完便条，站起身并拿了帽子。</p> 
<p>“就两步路，”科利亚不好意思说，“他现在坐在那里喝酒。我真弄不但，他凭什么使自己在那里可以赊帐？公爵、亲爱的，请以后别对我们家的人说，我给您递条子！我曾经发誓上千次，再也不递这些条子；可是不忍心；还有，请别跟他客气：给一点零钱，事情就了结了。”</p> 
<p>“我，科利亚，我自己本来就有个想法；我应该见见您爸爸……有一件事……我们走吧……”</p>
