In one of the side rooms there sat at a table--looking like one of the regular guests of the establishment--Ardalion Alexandrovitch, with a bottle before him, and a newspaper on his knee. He was waiting for the prince, and no sooner did the latter appear than he began a long harangue about something or other; but so far gone was he that the prince could hardly understand a word.</p> 
<p>"I have not got a ten-rouble note," said the prince; "but here is a twenty-five. Change it and give me back the fifteen, or I shall be left without a farthing myself."</p> 
<p>"Oh, of course, of course; and you quite understand that I--"</p> 
<p>"Yes; and I have another request to make, general. Have you ever been at Nastasia Philipovna's?"</p> 
<p>"I? I? Do you mean me? Often, my friend, often! I only pretended I had not in order to avoid a painful subject. You saw today, you were a witness, that I did all that a kind, an indulgent father could do. Now a father of altogether another type shall step into the scene. You shall see; the old soldier shall lay bare this intrigue, or a shameless woman will force her way into a respectable and noble family."</p> 
<p>"Yes, quite so. I wished to ask you whether you could show me the way to Nastasia Philipovna's tonight. I must go; I have business with her; I was not invited but I was introduced. Anyhow I am ready to trespass the laws of propriety if only I can get in somehow or other."</p> 
<p>"My dear young friend, you have hit on my very idea. It was not for this rubbish I asked you to come over here" (he pocketed the money, however, at this point), "it was to invite your alliance in the campaign against Nastasia Philipovna tonight. How well it sounds, 'General Ivolgin and Prince Muishkin.' That'll fetch her, I think, eh? Capital! We'll go at nine; there's time yet."</p> 
<p>"Where does she live?"</p> 
<p>"Oh, a long way off, near the Great Theatre, just in the square there--It won't be a large party."</p> 
<p>The general sat on and on. He had ordered a fresh bottle when the prince arrived; this took him an hour to drink, and then he had another, and another, during the consumption of which he told pretty nearly the whole story of his life. The prince was in despair. He felt that though he had but applied to this miserable old drunkard because he saw no other way of getting to Nastasia Philipovna's, yet he had been very wrong to put the slightest confidence in such a man.</p> 
<p>At last he rose and declared that he would wait no longer. The general rose too, drank the last drops that he could squeeze out of the bottle, and staggered into the street.</p> 
<p>Muishkin began to despair. He could not imagine how he had been so foolish as to trust this man. He only wanted one thing, and that was to get to Nastasia Philipovna's, even at the cost of a certain amount of impropriety. But now the scandal threatened to be more than he had bargained for. By this time Ardalion Alexandrovitch was quite intoxicated, and he kept his companion listening while he discoursed eloquently and pathetically on subjects of all kinds, interspersed with torrents of recrimination against the members of his family. He insisted that all his troubles were caused by their bad conduct, and time alone would put an end to them.</p> 
<p>At last they reached the Litaynaya. The thaw increased steadily, a warm, unhealthy wind blew through the streets, vehicles splashed through the mud, and the iron shoes of horses and mules rang on the paving stones. Crowds of melancholy people plodded wearily along the footpaths, with here and there a drunken man among them.</p> 
<p>"Do you see those brightly-lighted windows?" said the general. "Many of my old comrades-in-arms live about here, and I, who served longer, and suffered more than any of them, am walking on foot to the house of a woman of rather questionable reputation! A man, look you, who has thirteen bullets on his breast! ... You don't believe it? Well, I can assure you it was entirely on my account that Pirogoff telegraphed to Paris, and left Sebastopol at the greatest risk during the siege. Nelaton, the Tuileries surgeon, demanded a safe conduct, in the name of science, into the besieged city in order to attend my wounds. The government knows all about it. 'That's the Ivolgin with thirteen bullets in him!' That's how they speak of me.... Do you see that house, prince? One of my old friends lives on the first floor, with his large family. In this and five other houses, three overlooking Nevsky, two in the Morskaya, are all that remain of my personal friends. Nina Alexandrovna gave them up long ago, but I keep in touch with them still... I may say I find refreshment in this little coterie, in thus meeting my old acquaintances and subordinates, who worship me still, in spite of all. General Sokolovitch (by the way, I have not called on him lately, or seen Anna Fedorovna)... You know, my dear prince, when a person does not receive company himself, he gives up going to other people's houses involuntarily. And yet ... well ... you look as if you didn't believe me.... Well now, why should I not present the son of my old friend and companion to this delightful family--General Ivolgin and Prince Muishkin? You will see a lovely girl--what am I saying--a lovely girl? No, indeed, two, three! Ornaments of this city and of society: beauty, education, culture--the woman question--poetry--everything! Added to which is the fact that each one will have a dot of at least eighty thousand roubles. No bad thing, eh? ... In a word I absolutely must introduce you to them: it is a duty, an obligation. General Ivolgin and Prince Muishkin. Tableau!"</p> 
<p>"At once? Now? You must have forgotten ... " began the prince.</p> 
<p>"No, I have forgotten nothing. Come! This is the house--up this magnificent staircase. I am surprised not to see the porter, but .... it is a holiday ... and the man has gone off ... Drunken fool! Why have they not got rid of him? Sokolovitch owes all the happiness he has had in the service and in his private life to me, and me alone, but ... here we are."</p> 
<p>The prince followed quietly, making no further objection for fear of irritating the old man. At the same time he fervently hoped that General Sokolovitch and his family would fade away like a mirage in the desert, so that the visitors could escape, by merely returning downstairs. But to his horror he saw that General Ivolgin was quite familiar with the house, and really seemed to have friends there. At every step he named some topographical or biographical detail that left nothing to be desired on the score of accuracy. When they arrived at last, on the first floor, and the general turned to ring the bell to the right, the prince decided to run away, but a curious incident stopped him momentarily.</p> 
<p>"You have made a mistake, general," said he. " The name on the door is Koulakoff, and you were going to see General Sokolovitch."</p> 
<p>"Koulakoff ... Koulakoff means nothing. This is Sokolovitch's flat, and I am ringing at his door.... What do I care for Koulakoff? ... Here comes someone to open."</p> 
<p>In fact, the door opened directly, and the footman in formed the visitors that the family were all away.</p> 
<p>"What a pity! What a pity! It's just my luck!" repeated Ardalion Alexandrovitch over and over again, in regretful tones. " When your master and mistress return, my man, tell them that General Ivolgin and Prince Muishkin desired to present themselves, and that they were extremely sorry, excessively grieved ..."</p> 
<p>Just then another person belonging to the household was seen at the back of the hall. It was a woman of some forty years, dressed in sombre colours, probably a housekeeper or a governess. Hearing the names she came forward with a look of suspicion on her face.</p> 
<p>"Marie Alexandrovna is not at home," said she, staring hard at the general. "She has gone to her mother's, with Alexandra Michailovna."</p> 
<p>"Alexandra Michailovna out, too! How disappointing! Would you believe it, I am always so unfortunate! May I most respectfully ask you to present my compliments to Alexandra Michailovna, and remind her ... tell her, that with my whole heart I wish for her what she wished for herself on Thursday evening, while she was listening to Chopin's Ballade. She will remember. I wish it with all sincerity. General Ivolgin and Prince Muishkin!"</p> 
<p>The woman's face changed; she lost her suspicious expression.</p> 
<p>"I will not fail to deliver your message," she replied, and bowed them out.</p> 
<p>As they went downstairs the general regretted repeatedly that he had failed to introduce the prince to his friends.</p> 
<p>"You know I am a bit of a poet," said he. "Have you noticed it? The poetic soul, you know." Then he added suddenly--"But after all ... after all I believe we made a mistake this time! I remember that the Sokolovitch's live in another house, and what is more, they are just now in Moscow. Yes, I certainly was at fault. However, it is of no consequence."</p> 
<p>"Just tell me," said the prince in reply, "may I count still on your assistance? Or shall I go on alone to see Nastasia Philipovna?"</p> 
<p>"Count on my assistance? Go alone? How can you ask me that question, when it is a matter on which the fate of my family so largely depends? You don't know Ivolgin, my friend. To trust Ivolgin is to trust a rock; that's how the first squadron I commanded spoke of me. 'Depend upon Ivolgin,' said they all, 'he is as steady as a rock.' But, excuse me, I must just call at a house on our way, a house where I have found consolation and help in all my trials for years."</p> 
<p>"You are going home?"</p> 
<p>"No ... I wish ... to visit Madame Terentieff, the widow of Captain Terentieff, my old subordinate and friend. She helps me to keep up my courage, and to bear the trials of my domestic life, and as I have an extra burden on my mind today ..."</p> 
<p>"It seems to me," interrupted the prince, "that I was foolish to trouble you just now. However, at present you ... Good-bye!"</p> 
<p>"Indeed, you must not go away like that, young man, you must not!" cried the general. "My friend here is a widow, the mother of a family; her words come straight from her heart, and find an echo in mine. A visit to her is merely an affair of a few minutes; I am quite at home in her house. I will have a wash, and dress, and then we can drive to the Grand Theatre. Make up your mind to spend the evening with me.... We are just there--that's the house... Why, Colia! you here! Well, is Marfa Borisovna at home or have you only just come?"</p> 
<p>"Oh no! I have been here a long while," replied Colia, who was at the front door when the general met him. "I am keeping Hippolyte company. He is worse, and has been in bed all day. I came down to buy some cards. Marfa Borisovna expects you. But what a state you are in, father!" added the boy, noticing his father's unsteady gait. "Well, let us go in."</p> 
<p>On meeting Colia the prince determined to accompany the general, though he made up his mind to stay as short a time as possible. He wanted Colia, but firmly resolved to leave the general behind. He could not forgive himself for being so simple as to imagine that Ivolgin would be of any use. The three climbed up the long staircase until they reached the fourth floor where Madame Terentieff lived.</p> 
<p>"You intend to introduce the prince?" asked Colia, as they went up.</p> 
<p>"Yes, my boy. I wish to present him: General Ivolgin and Prince Muishkin! But what's the matter? ... what? ... How is Marfa Borisovna?"</p> 
<p>"You know, father, you would have done much better not to come at all! She is ready to eat you up! You have not shown yourself since the day before yesterday and she is expecting the money. Why did you promise her any? You are always the same! Well, now you will have to get out of it as best you can."</p> 
<p>They stopped before a somewhat low doorway on the fourth floor. Ardalion Alexandrovitch, evidently much out of countenance, pushed Muishkin in front.</p> 
<p>"I will wait here," he stammered. "I should like to surprise her. ...."</p> 
<p>Colia entered first, and as the door stood open, the mistress of the house peeped out. The surprise of the general's imagination fell very flat, for she at once began to address him in terms of reproach.</p> 
<p>Marfa Borisovna was about forty years of age. She wore a dressing-jacket, her feet were in slippers, her face painted, and her hair was in dozens of small plaits. No sooner did she catch sight of Ardalion Alexandrovitch than she screamed:</p> 
<p>"There he is, that wicked, mean wretch! I knew it was he! My heart misgave me!"</p> 
<p>The old man tried to put a good face on the affair.</p> 
<p>"Come, let us go in--it's all right," he whispered in the prince's ear.</p> 
<p>But it was more serious than he wished to think. As soon as the visitors had crossed the low dark hall, and entered the narrow reception-room, furnished with half a dozen cane chairs, and two small card-tables, Madame Terentieff, in the shrill tones habitual to her, continued her stream of invectives.</p> 
<p>"Are you not ashamed? Are you not ashamed? You barbarian! You tyrant! You have robbed me of all I possessed--you have sucked my bones to the marrow. How long shall I be your victim? Shameless, dishonourable man!"</p> 
<p>"Marfa Borisovna! Marfa Borisovna! Here is ... the Prince Muishkin! General Ivolgin and Prince Muishkin," stammered the disconcerted old man.</p> 
<p>"Would you believe," said the mistress of the house, suddenly addressing the prince, "would you believe that that man has not even spared my orphan children? He has stolen everything I possessed, sold everything, pawned everything; he has left me nothing--nothing! What am I to do with your IOU's, you cunning, unscrupulous rogue? Answer, devourer I answer, heart of stone! How shall I feed my orphans? with what shall I nourish them? And now he has come, he is drunk! He can scarcely stand. How, oh how, have I offended the Almighty, that He should bring this curse upon me! Answer, you worthless villain, answer!"</p> 
<p>But this was too much for the general.</p> 
<p>"Here are twenty-five roubles, Marfa Borisovna ... it is all that I can give ... and I owe even these to the prince's generosity--my noble friend. I have been cruelly deceived. Such is ... life ... Now ... Excuse me, I am very weak," he continued, standing in the centre of the room, and bowing to all sides. "I am faint; excuse me! Lenotchka ... a cushion ... my dear!"</p> 
<p>Lenotchka, a little girl of eight, ran to fetch the cushion at once, and placed it on the rickety old sofa. The general meant to have said much more, but as soon as he had stretched himself out, he turned his face to the wall, and slept the sleep of the just.</p> 
<p>With a grave and ceremonious air, Marfa Borisovna motioned the prince to a chair at one of the card-tables. She seated herself opposite, leaned her right cheek on her hand, and sat in silence, her eyes fixed on Muishkin, now and again sighing deeply. The three children, two little girls and a boy, Lenotchka being the eldest, came and leant on the table and also stared steadily at him. Presently Colia appeared from the adjoining room.</p> 
<p>"I am very glad indeed to have met you here, Colia," said the prince. "Can you do something for me? I must see Nastasia Philipovna, and I asked Ardalion Alexandrovitch just now to take me to her house, but he has gone to sleep, as you see. Will you show me the way, for I do not know the street? I have the address, though; it is close to the Grand Theatre."</p> 
<p>"Nastasia Philipovna? She does not live there, and to tell you the truth my father has never been to her house! It is strange that you should have depended on him! She lives near Wladimir Street, at the Five Corners, and it is quite close by. Will you go directly? It is just half-past nine. I will show you the way with pleasure."</p> 
<p>Colia and the prince went off together. Alas! the latter had no money to pay for a cab, so they were obliged to walk.</p> 
<p>"I should have liked to have taken you to see Hippolyte," said Colia. "He is the eldest son of the lady you met just now, and was in the next room. He is ill, and has been in bed all day. But he is rather strange, and extremely sensitive, and I thought he might be upset considering the circumstances in which you came ... Somehow it touches me less, as it concerns my father, while it is HIS mother. That, of course, makes a great difference. What is a terrible disgrace to a woman, does not disgrace a man, at least not in the same way. Perhaps public opinion is wrong in condemning one sex, and excusing the other. Hippolyte is an extremely clever boy, but so prejudiced. He is really a slave to his opinions."</p> 
<p>"Do you say he is consumptive?"</p> 
<p>"Yes. It really would be happier for him to die young. If I were in his place I should certainly long for death. He is unhappy about his brother and sisters, the children you saw. If it were possible, if we only had a little money, we should leave our respective families, and live together in a little apartment of our own. It is our dream. But, do you know, when I was talking over your affair with him, he was angry, and said that anyone who did not call out a man who had given him a blow was a coward. He is very irritable to-day, and I left off arguing the matter with him. So Nastasia Philipovna has invited you to go and see her?"</p> 
<p>"To tell the truth, she has not."</p> 
<p>"Then how do you come to be going there?" cried Colia, so much astonished that he stopped short in the middle of the pavement. "And ... and are you going to her At Home in that costume?"</p> 
<p>"I don't know, really, whether I shall be allowed in at all. If she will receive me, so much the better. If not, the matter is ended. As to my clothes--what can I do?"</p> 
<p>"Are you going there for some particular reason, or only as a way of getting into her society, and that of her friends?"</p> 
<p>"No, I have really an object in going ... That is, I am going on business it is difficult to explain, but..."</p> 
<p>"Well, whether you go on business or not is your affair, I do not want to know. The only important thing, in my eyes, is that you should not be going there simply for the pleasure of spending your evening in such company--cocottes, generals, usurers! If that were the case I should despise and laugh at you. There are terribly few honest people here, and hardly any whom one can respect, although people put on airs--Varia especially! Have you noticed, prince, how many adventurers there are nowadays? Especially here, in our dear Russia. How it has happened I never can understand. There used to be a certain amount of solidity in all things, but now what happens? Everything is exposed to the public gaze, veils are thrown back, every wound is probed by careless fingers. We are for ever present at an orgy of scandalous revelations. Parents blush when they remember their old-fashioned morality. At Moscow lately a father was heard urging his son to stop at nothing--at nothing, mind you!--to get money! The press seized upon the story, of course, and now it is public property. Look at my father, the general! See what he is, and yet, I assure you, he is an honest man! Only ... he drinks too much, and his morals are not all we could desire. Yes, that's true! I pity him, to tell the truth, but I dare not say so, because everybody would laugh at me--but I do pity him! And who are the really clever men, after all? Money- grubbers, every one of them, from the first to the last. Hippolyte finds excuses for money-lending, and says it is a necessity. He talks about the economic movement, and the ebb and flow of capital; the devil knows what he means. It makes me angry to hear him talk so, but he is soured by his troubles. Just imagine-the general keeps his mother-but she lends him money! She lends it for a week or ten days at very high interest! Isn't it disgusting? And then, you would hardly believe it, but my mother-- Nina Alexandrovna--helps Hippolyte in all sorts of ways, sends him money and clothes. She even goes as far as helping the children, through Hippolyte, because their mother cares nothing about them, and Varia does the same."</p> 
<p>"Well, just now you said there were no honest nor good people about, that there were only money-grubbers--and here they are quite close at hand, these honest and good people, your mother and Varia! I think there is a good deal of moral strength in helping people in suchcircum stances."</p> 
<p>"Varia does it from pride, and likes showing off, and giving herself airs. As to my mother, I really do admire her--yes, and honour her. Hippolyte, hardened as he is, feels it. He laughed at first, and thought it vulgar of her--but now, he is sometimes quite touched and overcome by her kindness. H'm! You call that being strong and good? I will remember that! Gania knows nothing about it. He would say that it was encouraging vice."</p> 
<p>"Ah, Gania knows nothing about it? It seems there are many things that Gania does not know," exclaimed the prince, as he considered Colia's last words.</p> 
<p>"Do you know, I like you very much indeed, prince? I shall never forget about this afternoon."</p> 
<p>"I like you too, Colia."</p> 
<p>"Listen to me! You are going to live here, are you not?" said Colia. "I mean to get something to do directly, and earn money. Then shall we three live together? You, and I, and Hippolyte? We will hire a flat, and let the general come and visit us. What do you say?"</p> 
<p>"It would be very pleasant," returned the prince. "But we must see. I am really rather worried just now. What! are we there already? Is that the house? What a long flight of steps! And there's a porter! Well, Colia I don't know what will come of it all."</p> 
<p>The prince seemed quite distracted for the moment.</p> 
<p>"You must tell me all about it tomorrow! Don't be afraid. I wish you success; we agree so entirely I that can do so, although I do not understand why you are here. Good-bye!" cried Colia excitedly. "Now I will rush back and tell Hippolyte all about our plans and proposals! But as to your getting in--don't be in the least afraid. You will see her. She is so original about everything. It's the first floor. The porter will show you."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>科利亚带领公爵走得不远，就到利捷伊纳亚街一座台球房兼咖啡屋，它在房子底层，从街上就可以进去。咖啡屋内右边角落有一个单间，阿尔达利翁·亚历山德罗维奇作为一个老主顾这时正坐在这里，面前小桌上摆着一瓶酒，手上真的拿着一份《比利时独立报》。他在等候公爵，一看见他，就立即放下报纸，开始热切和嗜苏地解释起来，不过公爵几乎一点也没有听明白，因为将军差不多已经喝醉了。</p> 
<p>“１０卢布的票子我没有，”公爵打断他说，“这是２５卢布，您去换开它，找我１５卢布，因为我自己也分文不剩了。”</p> 
<p>“哦，没有疑问；请相信，我马上……”</p> 
<p>“此外，我对您有一个请求，将军；您从来没有去过纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜家吗？”</p> 
<p>“我？我没有去过？您这是在对我说吗？我去过好多次，我亲爱的，好多次！”将军大为洋洋得意和沾沾自喜，不无讥讽地嚷了起来，“但是，最后我自己中止了，因为我不想鼓励这种不光彩的联姻。您自己也看到了，今天早晨您是见证人：我做了父亲所能做的一切，但是这是个温顺和姑息的父亲；现在登场的将是另一种样子的父亲，到时候您会看见的，瞧着吧：究竟是战功卓著的老兵战胜阴谋，还是一个恬不知耻的风流女人走进一个极为高尚的家庭。”</p> 
<p>“我正想请求您，您作为一个熟人，今晚是否能带我去纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜那里？我今天一定得去；我有事情；但是我根本不知道，怎么才能进去。虽然我刚才被介绍了，但毕竟没有受到邀请：今晚那里是一个应邀出席的晚会。不过，我准备跳过某些礼节，甚至让人家嘲笑我，只要设法能进去。”</p> 
<p>“您完全完全与我的想法不谋而台，我年轻的朋友，”将军激动地喊着说，“我叫您来不是为了这种小事！”他继续说着，不过，还是顺手抓起钱，把它放到口袋里，“我叫您来正是要邀您作伴向纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜家进军，或者最好是说，讨伐纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜！伊沃尔金将军和梅什金公爵。！这会给她一个什么印象！我呢，装作是恭贺生日，最后要宣布自己的心愿，是间接地，不直截了当宣布，但是一切又像单刀直入一样。到那时加尼亚自己会看到，他该怎么办：是要功勋卓著的……父亲呢，还是……所谓的……其他等等，不是……但是要发生的事总是要发生的！您的想法好极了。９点钟我们动身，我们还有时间。”</p> 
<p>“她住在什么地方？”</p> 
<p>“离这儿很远：在大剧院附近梅托夫佐娃家的房子里，几乎就在广场那里，她住在二楼……尽管是庆贺生日，她那里不会有大的聚会，散得也早……”</p> 
<p>早就已经是晚上了；公爵仍然坐着，听着，等待着将军，而他却开始讲起难以数计的许多趣闻铁事来，只是没一个是讲到底的。因为公爵的来到，他又要了一瓶酒，直到过了一个小时才把它喝完，接着又要了一瓶，也把它喝光了。应该认为，在这段时间里将军来得及把他几乎一生的经历都讲出来；最后，公爵站起身并说，他不能再等了。将军把瓶底的酒喝干净，站起来，走出了房间，走起路来很不稳健。公爵感到很是失望：他不能明白，他怎么能这么愚蠢地就相信人。实际上他从来也不曾相信过；他指望将军，只是为了设法到纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜家去，甚至准备做出一点越轨的事；可是却并不打算闹出过分荒唐的丑闻来。可现在将军完全醉了，夸夸其谈，滔滔不绝，十分动情，暗自泪下。他不停地说着，讲到由于他家医的全体成员的不良行为一切都被毁了，还说，这种情况终究是该结束了。他们终于来到了利捷依纳亚街。雪仍然继续融化着；萧瑟的暖风带着一股腐烂味挑过街道，马车在泥泞中吧塔吧嘈行进，走马和鸳马的蹄铁碰击着路面，发出响亮的声音。一群湿漉漉的无精打采的行人在人行道上踯躅。还能碰上一些喝醉的人。</p> 
<p>“您看见这些灯光照亮时二楼房间吗？”将军说，“我的同僚全住在这里，而我是他们中服役时间最长、吃的苦头最多的，现在却蹒跚着去大剧院那里一个不清不白的女人家里！一个胸膛里有１３颗子弹的人……您不相信吗？当时皮罗戈夫只好为我向巴黎发电报并一度抛下被围的塞瓦斯托波尔，而巴黎的大医涅拉东以科学的名义设法弄到了自由通行证、来被围的塞瓦斯托波尔为我做检查。这事最高当局也知道：‘噢，这就是那个身上有１３颗子弹的伊沃尔金！……’他们就是这么谈论我的！公爵，您看见这槽房子了吗？在这一楼住着我的老伙伴索科洛维奇将军及其门庭高贵、成员众多的家庭。这一家还有涅瓦大街上的三家和莫尔斯卡亚街上的两家，是我现在结交的全部范围，也就是说，是我个人结交的囵子。尼娜·“亚历山德罗夫娜早就已经屈服于环境了。我则依然回忆着……这么说吧，我不继续在我过去的同僚和部下－－那个有教养的园子中间休息，他们至今还崇拜我。这个索科洛维奇将军（不过，我有根久很久没去他那儿了，也没见着安娜·费奥多罗夫娜）……您知道，亲爱的公爵，当你自己不接待客人时，不知怎么地也就不自觉地不再上人家门了。然而……嗯……您好像不相信……不过，我为什么不带我好朋友和童年时代伙伴的儿子上这个可爱的家去呢？伊沃尔金将军和梅什金公爵！您将会见到美貌惊人的姑娘，还不是一个，是两个，甚至三个，她们是首都和上流社会的骄傲：美丽，教养好，有志向……。妇女问题，诗歌，所有这一切合在一起，聚成了一个幸福美满的丰富多彩的混合体，这还不算每人至少有八万卢布现金的陪嫁，而不论是有妇女问题还是有社会问题，这笔钱是永远也不会有什么影响的……总之，我一定，一定要，也有义务带您去。伊沃尔金将军和梅什金公爵！”</p> 
<p>“马上？现在？但是，您忘了，”公爵刚开始说。</p> 
<p>“没有，我一点也没有忘，走！往这里，上这座富丽堂皇的楼梯。我很惊奇，怎么没有看门人，哦……是节日，所以看门人不在。他们还没有把这个酒鬼赶走。这个索科洛维奇生活和公务上的全部好福气都多亏我，全靠我一个人，而不是别的任何人，哦……我们到了。”</p> 
<p>公爵已经不反对这次拜访，顺从地跟在将军后面，免得惹他生气；他怀着一种坚定的希望：索科洛维奇将军和他全家如海市蜃楼一样渐渐地消失，这样他们就可以心安理得地回转下楼。但是，令他大为惊惶的是，他开始失去这种希望：将军带他上楼梯，忏如一个在这里真的有熟人的人似的，还一刻不停地插讲着一些生平和地形的细节，而且说得像数学般的精确，他们已经登上二楼，终于在一套富丽阔绰的住所门前右边停了下来，将军握住了门铃把手，公爵这时才下定决心要彻底逃走；但是一个奇怪的情况又把他暂时留住了。</p> 
<p>“您弄错了，将军，”他说，“门上写的是库拉科夫，而您打铃要叫的是索科洛维奇。”</p> 
<p>“库拉科夫……库拉科夫这名字也说明不了什么问题。这是索科洛维奇的住宅，所以我打铃叫索科络维奇；才不管他库拉科夫呢……瞧马上就开门了。”</p> 
<p>门真的打开了。仆人朝外一望便通知说：“主人不在家。”</p> 
<p>“多遗憾，多遗憾，仿佛故意似的，”阿尔达利翁·亚历山德罗维奇深深惋惜地重复说了好几次，“请报告，我亲爱的，说伊沃尔金将军和橱什金公爵曾经来过，想表达一下他们的敬意，可是非常、非常遗憾……”</p> 
<p>就在开门这一会儿从房间里还探出一张脸来，看起来像是女管家，甚至可能是家庭教师，一个４０岁左右、穿着深色衣裙的女士。她听到伊沃尔将军和梅什金公爵的名字后，好奇而又疑惑地走近前来。</p> 
<p>“玛里娅·亚历山德罗夫娜不在家，”她特别端详着将军，说，“带着亚山德拉·米哈伊洛夫娜出去了，上老太太家。”</p> 
<p>“亚历山德拉·米哈伊洛夫娜也跟他们去了，天哪，多倒霉呀！夫人，想想，我总是这么倒霉！恳请您转达我的问候，而对亚历山德拉·米哈伊夫娜说，让她想起……总之，请向他们转达我的衷心祝愿，祝他们星期四晚上听肖邦叙事曲时所许的愿能实现；他们记得的……我衷心地祝愿！伊沃金将军和梅什金公爵！”</p> 
<p>“我不会忘的，”女士鞠躬不礼，她已经比较信任他们了。</p> 
<p>下楼梯的时候，将军仍然热情未减地继续为他们拜访未果和公爵失去这么好的结识机会而感到惋惜不已。</p> 
<p>“知道吗，亲爱的，我有几分诗人的气质，您发觉没有？不过……不过我们走这里来好像不大对，”他忽然完全出人意料地做出这个结论，“索科洛维奇家，我现在想起来了，是住在另一幢房子里，甚至现在似乎是在莫斯科。是啊，我有点弄错了，但是这……没什么。”</p> 
<p>“我只想知道一点，”公爵颓丧地说，“我是否应该根本不再指望您并让我一个人去？”</p> 
<p>“不再？指望？一个人？但是这又从何说起？对我来说这可是件非常的事情，它在许多方面决定着我全家的命运。但是，我年轻的朋友，您还了解伊沃尔金。谁说到 ‘墙’，就是说的‘伊沃尔金’。正如我开始服役的时连里说的，‘依靠伊沃尔金犹如靠在涵上一样可靠。’我这就顺路到一家人家去一会儿，我的心灵在那里得到休息的，这已经有好几年了，在经历了忧虑不安和种种磨难以后……”</p> 
<p>“您想顺便回家去？”</p> 
<p>“不！我想……去大尉夫人捷连季那娃那里，是捷连季耶夫大尉的邀请。大尉原是我部下……甚至还是朋友……在大尉夫人这里，我精神上得到复活：我把生活中和家庭中的痛苦带到这里来，因为今天我恰恰带着很大的精神负担，所以我……”</p> 
<p>“我觉得，刚才去惊扰您，我就于了一件十分愚蠢的傻事，”公爵喃喃说，“况且您现在……告辞了。”</p> 
<p>“但是我不能，不能放您离开我，我年轻的朋友！”将军抬高声音说， “一位寡妇，一位家庭的母亲，用自己的心弹拨着那些弦，发出的响声在我身上产生着共鸣。去拜访她，只要五分钟，在这个家里我是不用客气的，我几乎就像住在这里一样；我要洗一洗，做些最起码的修饰，然后我们就坐马车去大剧院。您请相信，这整个晚上我都需要您……瞧；就在这幢房子里，我们已经到了……啊，科利亚，您已经在这里了？怎么，玛尔法·鲍里索夫娜在家，还是你自己刚来到？”</p> 
<p>“哦，不，”恰巧在屋子大门口碰到他们的科利亚回答说，“我早就在这里了，跟伊波利特在一起，他的情况更不好，今天早晨躺倒了。我现在去小店买纸牌。玛尔法，鲍里索夫娜在等您，只不过，爸爸，瞧您怎么这副样子！……”科利亚定睛细细打量将军的步态和站立的姿势便明白了，“算了我们走吧！”</p> 
<p>与科利亚相遇促使公爵陪同将军去玛尔法·鲍里索夫娜那里，但只能呆一会儿。公爵需要科利亚；他已下决心无论如何要抛开将军，他不能原谅自己刚才还想到把希望寄托在他身上。他们从后梯上四楼，走了很久。</p> 
<p>“您想介绍公爵认识一下？”科利亚边走边问。</p> 
<p>“是的，我的朋友，介绍一下：伊沃尔金将军和梅什金公爵，但是……玛尔法·鲍里索夫娜……怎么样……”</p> 
<p>“要知道，爸爸，您最好别去！她会吃了您！您三天不露面了，可她等钱用。您为什么答应给她弄钱来？您老是这样！现在您自己去对付吧。”</p> 
<p>在四楼他们在一扇低矮的门前停了下来。将军显然有些畏怯，便把公爵往前推。</p> 
<p>“我就留在这里，”他嘟哝说，“我想来个出其不意……”</p> 
<p>科利亚第一个走了进去。一个４０岁左右、浓装艳抹的女人，穿着便鞋和短祆，头发编成辫子，从门里向外张望了一下，这“出其不意”便始料不及地破产了。她一见将军，立即就大叫起来：</p> 
<p>“这正是他，这个卑贱和恶毒的人，我的心预料的正是这样！”</p> 
<p>“进去吧，这没什么，”将军对公爵嘟哝说，一边依然像无辜似的讪笑着。</p> 
<p>但并非是没什么，经过幽暗低矮的前室，他们刚一走进摆着六张腾椅和两张小牌桌的厅屋，女主人马上就用做作的哭腔和平常的声调继续责骂着：</p> 
<p>“你真不要脸，真不要脸，你是我家的野蛮人和霸主，野蛮人和暴徒：你把我所有的全都抢劫光，吸干了汁水，这还不满足！我要忍受你到什么时候，你这个不要脸和无耻的人！”</p> 
<p>“玛尔法·鲍里索夫娜，玛尔法·鲍里索夫娜！这位是……梅什金公爵。伊沃尔金将军和梅什金公爵，”战占兢兢和不知所措的将军喃喃说。</p> 
<p>“您相信不，”大尉夫人突然朝公爵说，“您相信不，这个不要脸的人连我这些孤苦伶仃的孩子也不饶过！全都要抢，全都要偷，全都要卖，全都要当，什么都不留下。叫我拿你这些借据怎么办呀，你这个狡猾的没良心的人？你回答，老滑头，你回答我，你这颗贪得无厌的心：拿什么，我拿什么来养活我这些孤苦无依的孩子？瞧你喝得醉醺醺，站也站不稳……什么地方我得罪了上帝，你这个可恶而荒唐的滑头，回答呀？”</p> 
<p>但是将军却顾不上这些。</p> 
<p>“玛尔法·鲍里索夫娜，２５卢布……这是我能给你的全部数额了，是一位无比高尚的朋友提供的帮助。公爵！我真是大大地错了！生活。……就是这样……现在……对不起，我很虚，”将军站在房间中央，朝四面八方连连鞠躬，继续说，“我没有力气，对不起！列诺奇卡！拿枕头来……亲爱的！”</p> 
<p>列诺诺卡，一个８岁的小姑娘，马上跑去取枕头了，并将它放在漆布面的又硬又破的沙发上。将军坐到它上面，本还打算说许多话，但一碰到沙发，马上就歪向一侧，朝向墙壁，酣然入睡，做他的君子梦了。玛尔法·鲍里索夫娜客气而又凄苦地给公爵指了指在小牌桌旁的一张椅子，自己则在对面坐下，一只手撑着右脸颊，一边望着公爵，一边开始默默地叹息。三个小孩（两女一男，其中列诺奇卡最大）走近桌子，三人全都把手放到桌子上，并且都凝神打量着公爵。科利亚从另一个房间里出来了。</p> 
<p>“我很高兴在这里遇见您，科利亚，”公爵对他说，“您是否能帮我个忙？我一定得去纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜那里。我刚才请求阿尔达利翁·亚历山德罗维奇，但他现在睡着了。您送我去吧，因为我既不知道街道，也不知道路名。不过有一个地址：大剧院附近，梅托夫佐娃的楼房里。”</p> 
<p>“纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜？她可从来也不住在大剧院附近，如果您想知道的话，父亲也从来没有到过她家里；真奇怪，你居然还期望从他那里得到什么帮助。纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜住在弗拉基米尔街附近，靠近五角地，这儿去近得多。您现在就去吗？现在９点半。好吧，我送您到那里。”</p> 
<p>公爵和科利亚马上就走了出来。唉！公爵没有钱雇马车，只得步行了去。“我本想介绍您跟伊波利特认识，”科利亚说，“他是穿短袄的上尉夫人的大儿子，在另一个房间；他身体不好，今天整天都躺着。但他是个很怪的人；他容易受委屈得不得了，我觉得，他会不好意思见您的，因为您在这样的时刻来到他家来，我毕竟不像他那么感到害羞，因为我这边是父亲，而他那里是母亲，这里到底是不一样的，因为这种情况对男人来说不是什么耻辱。不过，这也许是性方面男尊女卑的成见。伊波利特是个好小伙，但他是某些偏见的奴隶。”</p> 
<p>“您说，他有肺病？”</p> 
<p>“是的，似乎还是快点死去的好，我要是处在他的地位，就一走愿意死去。他则舍不得兄弟姐妹，就是那几个小的。如果可能的话，只要有钱，我就和他租一套单独的住宅，离开我们的家庭。这是我们的理想。知道吗，刚才我对他讲了您的遭遇，他竟十分生气，说，谁挨了耳光而不提出决斗，这人便是窝囊废。不过，他气得不得了，我就不再跟他争论了。那么，这么说，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜怎么马上就邀请您去她那里的？”</p> 
<p>“问题就在于没有邀请。”</p> 
<p>“那您怎么还去？”科利亚喊了起来，甚至在人行道上停住了。“而且……穿这么一身衣服，那里是应邀参加的晚会吗？”</p> 
<p>“真的，我实在不知道，怎么才能进去。能接待，那很好，不接待，事情就错过去了。至于说衣服，这时还有什么办法？”</p> 
<p>“您有事吗？还是只不过要‘在上流社会’ｐｏｕｒ ｐａｓｓｅｒ ｌｅ ｔｅｍｐｓ＊？”</p> 
<p>“不，我其实……也就是我有事……我很难表达这一点，但是……”</p> 
<p>“算了，究竟是什么事，这就随您的便吧，对我来说主要的是，您在那里不是无缘无故地硬要参加晚会，死乞白赖地要挤进风流女人、将军、高利贷者组成的令人迷醉和社交界去。如果是这样，对不起，公爵，我则会嘲笑您，并且会蔑视您。这里正直的人大少了，甚至根本就没有人值得尊敬；你不由得会瞧于起他们，可他们都要求别人尊敬；瓦里娅是第一个瞧不起他们的人。公爵，您发现没有，我们这个时代所有的人都是冒险家！而且恰恰是在我们俄罗斯，在我们可爱的祖国。怎么会弄成这样的，我不明白。好像曾经是很坚固的，可现在怎样呢？大家都在说，到处都在写。是揭露。我们大家都在揭露。父母首先改变了态度，他们自己为过去的道德感到羞耻。在莫斯科，有个父亲劝说儿子，为了弄到钱，不论碰到什么都不后退；这是报刊上登了知道的。您再瞧瞧我的将军。嘿，他落得什么下场了？不过，您知道吗，我觉得，我的将军是个正直的人，真的，是这样的！这不过全是潦倒和酗酒所至。真的，是这样！甚至很可怜；我只是怕说，因为大家会笑我的；可是，的确很可怜。而那些聪明人，他们身上又有什么呢？全都是放高利贷的，无一例外！伊波利特为放高利革辩解，说需要这样，什么经济动荡，什么涨啊落啊，鬼才明白这些。他的这番话使我十分烦恼，可是他充满了怨恨。您设想一下，他的母亲，就是那个大尉夫人，从将军那儿得到钱，又马上放高利贷给他；这多么恬不知耻！您要知道，妈妈，也就是我的妈妈，尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜，将军夫人，经常给钱、裙子、衣服和别的东西帮助伊波利特，甚至通过伊波利特多少还接济一下那几个孩子，因为他们的母亲对他们不加问津。瓦里娅也这样做。”</p> 
<p>“您瞧，您说没有正直和刚强的人，全部只是一些放高利贷的人；您母亲和瓦里娅，这不就是刚强的人吗。这种地方，这样的境况下帮助别人，难道不是精神力量的标志吗？”</p> 
<p>“瓦里卡是出于自尊心，出于爱夸口才这么做的，为的是不落后于母亲；而妈妈倒确实……我敬重她，是的，我敬佩她、承认她这点。甚至伊波利特也受了感动，而他本来几乎是个冷漠无情的人。起先他还嘲笑，称妈妈这样做是卑劣的行径；但现在开始有时候他动感情了。嗯！您把这称作力量？我会注意这点的，加尼亚不知道，不然他会说这是纵容姑息。”</p> 
<p>“加尼亚不知道？似乎加尼亚还有许多事情并不知道，”公爵若有所思地脱口而出说。</p> 
<p>“您知道吗，公爵，我很喜欢您。刚才您遭遇的事一直索绕在我的脑海里。”</p> 
<p>“我也很喜欢您，科利亚。”</p> 
<p>“听着，您打算在这里怎么生活？很快我要给自．已找些活干，多少挣点钱，让我们--我。您和伊波利特--三个人一起生活，我们租一处住房；我们要不让将军到我们这儿来。”</p> 
<p>“我非常乐意。不过，我们以后再看吧。我现在心里很乱，很乱。怎么？已经到了？在这幢房里……大门多有气派！还有看门人。咳，科利亚，我不知道，这事会有什么结果。”</p> 
<p>公爵不知所措地站在那里。</p> 
<p>“明天说吧、别太胆怯。让上帝傈佑您成功，因为我自己在所有的方面都跟您的见解一样！再见。我不回那里去告诉伊波利特。至于说是否接待您，这不用怀疑；别担心！她是个非常独特的人。从一楼这座楼梯上去，看门人会指给您看的！”</p>
