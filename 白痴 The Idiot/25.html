You will not deny, seriously, that you were born just two years after your mother's legal marriage to Mr. Burdovsky, your father. Nothing would be easier than to prove the date of your birth from well-known facts; we can only look on Mr. Keller's version as a work of imagination, and one, moreover, extremely offensive both to you and your mother. Of course he distorted the truth in order to strengthen your claim, and to serve your interests. Mr. Keller said that he previously consulted you about his article in the paper, but did not read it to you as a whole. Certainly he could not have read that passage. .. . .</p> 
<p>"As a matter of fact, I did not read it," interrupted the boxer, "but its contents had been given me on unimpeachable authority, and I . . ."</p> 
<p>"Excuse me, Mr. Keller," interposed Gavrila Ardalionovitch. "Allow me to speak. I assure you your article shall be mentioned in its proper place, and you can then explain everything, but for the moment I would rather not anticipate. Quite accidentally, with the help of my sister, Varvara Ardalionovna Ptitsin, I obtained from one of her intimate friends, Madame Zoubkoff, a letter written to her twenty-five years ago, by Nicolai Andreevitch Pavlicheff, then abroad. After getting into communication with this lady, I went by her advice to Timofei Fedorovitch Viazovkin, a retired colonel, and one of Pavlicheff's oldest friends. He gave me two more letters written by the latter when he was still in foreign parts. These three documents, their dates, and the facts mentioned in them, prove in the most undeniable manner, that eighteen months before your birth, Nicolai Andreevitch went abroad, where he remained for three consecutive years. Your mother, as you are well aware, has never been out of Russia. . . . It is too late to read the letters now; I am content to state the fact. But if you desire it, come to me tomorrow morning, bring witnesses and writing experts with you, and I will prove the absolute truth of my story. From that moment the question will be decided."</p> 
<p>These words caused a sensation among the listeners, and there was a general movement of relief. Burdovsky got up abruptly.</p> 
<p>"If that is true," said he, "I have been deceived, grossly deceived, but not by Tchebaroff: and for a long time past, a long time. I do not wish for experts, not I, nor to go to see you. I believe you. I give it up.... But I refuse the ten thousand roubles. Good-bye."</p> 
<p>"Wait five minutes more, Mr. Burdovsky," said Gavrila Ardalionovitch pleasantly. "I have more to say. Some rather curious and important facts have come to light, and it is absolutely necessary, in my opinion, that you should hear them. You will not regret, I fancy, to have the whole matter thoroughly cleared up."</p> 
<p>Burdovsky silently resumed his seat, and bent his head as though in profound thought. His friend, Lebedeff's nephew, who had risen to accompany him, also sat down again. He seemed much disappointed, though as self-confident as ever. Hippolyte looked dejected and sulky, as well as surprised. He had just been attacked by a violent fit of coughing, so that his handkerchief was stained with blood. The boxer looked thoroughly frightened.</p> 
<p>"Oh, Antip!" cried he in a miserable voice, "I did say to you the other day--the day before yesterday--that perhaps you were not really Pavlicheff's son!"</p> 
<p>There were sounds of half-smothered laughter at this.</p> 
<p>"Now, that is a valuable piece of information, Mr. Keller," replied Gania. "However that may be, I have private information which convinces me that Mr. Burdovsky, though doubtless aware of the date of his birth, knew nothing at all about Pavlicheff's sojourn abroad. Indeed, he passed the greater part of his life out of Russia, returning at intervals for short visits. The journey in question is in itself too unimportant for his friends to recollect it after more than twenty years; and of course Mr. Burdovsky could have known nothing about it, for he was not born. As the event has proved, it was not impossible to find evidence of his absence, though I must confess that chance has helped me in a quest which might very well have come to nothing. It was really almost impossible for Burdovsky or Tchebaroff to discover these facts, even if it had entered their heads to try. Naturally they never dreamt...</p> 
<p>Here the voice of Hippolyte suddenly intervened.</p> 
<p>"Allow me, Mr. Ivolgin," he said irritably. "What is the good of all this rigmarole? Pardon me. All is now clear, and we acknowledge the truth of your main point. Why go into these tedious details? You wish perhaps to boast of the cleverness of your investigation, to cry up your talents as detective? Or perhaps your intention is to excuse Burdovsky, by roving that he took up the matter in ignorance? Well, I consider that extremely impudent on your part! You ought to know that Burdovsky has no need of being excused or justified by you or anyone else! It is an insult! The affair is quite painful enough for him without that. Will nothing make you understand?"</p> 
<p>"Enough! enough! Mr. Terentieff," interrupted Gania.</p> 
<p>"Don't excite yourself; you seem very ill, and I am sorry for that. I am almost done, but there are a few facts to which I must briefly refer, as I am convinced that they ought to be clearly explained once for all. . . ." A movement of impatience was noticed in his audience as he resumed: "I merely wish to state, for the information of all concerned, that the reason for Mr. Pavlicheff's interest in your mother, Mr. Burdovsky, was simply that she was the sister of a serf-girl with whom he was deeply in love in his youth, and whom most certainly he would have married but for her sudden death. I have proofs that this circumstance is almost, if not quite, forgotten. I may add that when your mother was about ten years old, Pavlicheff took her under his care, gave her a good education, and later, a considerable dowry. His relations were alarmed, and feared he might go so far as to marry her, but she gave her hand to a young land-surveyor named Burdovsky when she reached the age of twenty. I can even say definitely that it was a marriage of affection. After his wedding your father gave up his occupation as land- surveyor, and with his wife's dowry of fifteen thousand roubles went in for commercial speculations. As he had had no experience, he was cheated on all sides, and took to drink in order to forget his troubles. He shortened his life by his excesses, and eight years after his marriage he died. Your mother says herself that she was left in the direst poverty, and would have died of starvation had it not been for Pavlicheff, who generously allowed her a yearly pension of six hundred roubles. Many people recall his extreme fondness for you as a little boy. Your mother confirms this, and agrees with others in thinking that he loved you the more because you were a sickly child, stammering in your speech, and almost deformed--for it is known that all his life Nicolai Andreevitch had a partiality for unfortunates of every kind, especially children. In my opinion this is most important. I may add that I discovered yet another fact, the last on which I employed my detective powers. Seeing how fond Pavlicheff was of you,--it was thanks to him you went to school, and also had the advantage of special teachers--his relations and servants grew to believe that you were his son, and that your father had been betrayed by his wife. I may point out that this idea was only accredited generally during the last years of Pavlicheff's life, when his next-of-kin were trembling about the succession, when the earlier story was quite forgotten, and when all opportunity for discovering the truth had seemingly passed away. No doubt you, Mr. Burdovsky, heard this conjecture, and did not hesitate to accept it as true. I have had the honour of making your mother's acquaintance, and I find that she knows all about these reports. What she does not know is that you, her son, should have listened to them so complaisantly. I found your respected mother at Pskoff, ill and in deep poverty, as she has been ever since the death of your benefactor. She told me with tears of gratitude how you had supported her; she expects much of you, and believes fervently in your future success..."</p> 
<p>"Oh, this is unbearable!" said Lebedeff's nephew impatiently. "What is the good of all this romancing?"</p> 
<p>"It is revolting and unseemly!" cried Hippolyte, jumping up in a fury.</p> 
<p>Burdovsky alone sat silent and motionless.</p> 
<p>"What is the good of it?" repeated Gavrila Ardalionovitch, with pretended surprise. "Well, firstly, because now perhaps Mr. Burdovsky is quite convinced that Mr. Pavlicheff's love for him came simply from generosity of soul, and not from paternal duty. It was most necessary to impress this fact upon his mind, considering that he approved of the article written by Mr. Keller. I speak thus because I look on you, Mr. Burdovsky, as an honourable man. Secondly, it appears that there was no intention of cheating in this case, even on the part of Tchebaroff. I wish to say this quite plainly, because the prince hinted a while ago that I too thought it an attempt at robbery and extortion. On the contrary, everyone has been quite sincere in the matter, and although Tchebaroff may be somewhat of a rogue, in this business he has acted simply as any sharp lawyer would do under the circumstances. He looked at it as a case that might bring him in a lot of money, and he did not calculate badly; because on the one hand he speculated on the generosity of the prince, and his gratitude to the late Mr. Pavlicheff, and on the other to his chivalrous ideas as to the obligations of honour and conscience. As to Mr. Burdovsky, allowing for his principles, we may acknowledge that he engaged in the business with very little personal aim in view. At the instigation of Tchebaroff and his other friends, he decided to make the attempt in the service of truth, progress, and humanity. In short, the conclusion may be drawn that, in spite of all appearances, Mr. Burdovsky is a man of irreproachable character, and thus the prince can all the more readily offer him his friendship, and the assistance of which he spoke just now..."</p> 
<p>"Hush! hush! Gavrila Ardalionovitch!" cried Muishkin in dismay, but it was too late.</p> 
<p>"I said, and I have repeated it over and over again," shouted Burdovsky furiously, "that I did not want the money. I will not take it... why...I will not... I am going away!"</p> 
<p>He was rushing hurriedly from the terrace, when Lebedeff's nephew seized his arms, and said something to him in a low voice. Burdovsky turned quickly, and drawing an addressed but unsealed envelope from his pocket, he threw it down on a little table beside the prince.</p> 
<p>"There's the money!... How dare you?...The money!"</p> 
<p>"Those are the two hundred and fifty roubles you dared to send him as a charity, by the hands of Tchebaroff," explained Doktorenko.</p> 
<p>"The article in the newspaper put it at fifty!" cried Colia.</p> 
<p>"I beg your pardon," said the prince, going up to Burdovsky. "I have done you a great wrong, but I did not send you that money as a charity, believe me. And now I am again to blame. I offended you just now." (The prince was much distressed; he seemed worn out with fatigue, and spoke almost incoherently.) "I spoke of swindling... but I did not apply that to you. I was deceived .... I said you were... afflicted... like me... But you are not like me... you give lessons... you support your mother. I said you had dishonoured your mother, but you love her. She says so herself... I did not know... Gavrila Ardalionovitch did not tell me that... Forgive me! I dared to offer you ten thousand roubles, but I was wrong. I ought to have done it differently, and now... there is no way of doing it, for you despise me..."</p> 
<p>"I declare, this is a lunatic asylum!" cried Lizabetha Prokofievna.</p> 
<p>"Of course it is a lunatic asylum!" repeated Aglaya sharply, but her words were overpowered by other voices. Everybody was talking loudly, making remarks and comments; some discussed the affair gravely, others laughed. Ivan Fedorovitch Epanchin was extremely indignant. He stood waiting for his wife with an air of offended dignity. Lebedeff's nephew took up the word again.</p> 
<p>"Well, prince, to do you justice, you certainly know how to make the most of your--let us call it infirmity, for the sake of politeness; you have set about offering your money and friendship in such a way that no self-respecting man could possibly accept them. This is an excess of ingenuousness or of malice--you ought to know better than anyone which word best fits the case."</p> 
<p>"Allow me, gentlemen," said Gavrila Ardalionovitch, who had just examined the contents of the envelope, "there are only a hundred roubles here, not two hundred and fifty. I point this out, prince, to prevent misunderstanding."</p> 
<p>"Never mind, never mind," said the prince, signing to him to keep quiet.</p> 
<p>"But we do mind," said Lebedeff's nephew vehemently. "Prince, your 'never mind' is an insult to us. We have nothing to hide; our actions can bear daylight. It is true that there are only a hundred roubles instead of two hundred and fifty, but it is all the same."</p> 
<p>"Why, no, it is hardly the same," remarked Gavrila Ardalionovitch, with an air of ingenuous surprise.</p> 
<p>"Don't interrupt, we are not such fools as you think, Mr. Lawyer," cried Lebedeff's nephew angrily. "Of course there is a difference between a hundred roubles and two hundred and fifty, but in this case the principle is the main point, and that a hundred and fifty roubles are missing is only a side issue. The point to be emphasized is that Burdovsky will not accept your highness's charity; he flings it back in your face, and it scarcely matters if there are a hundred roubles or two hundred and fifty. Burdovsky has refused ten thousand roubles; you heard him. He would not have returned even a hundred roubles if he was dishonest! The hundred and fifty roubles were paid to Tchebaroff for his travelling expenses. You may jeer at our stupidity and at our inexperience in business matters; you have done all you could already to make us look ridiculous; but do not dare to call us dishonest. The four of us will club together every day to repay the hundred and fifty roubles to the prince, if we have to pay it in instalments of a rouble at a time, but we will repay it, with interest. Burdovsky is poor, he has no millions. After his journey to see the prince Tchebaroff sent in his bill. We counted on winning... Who would not have done the same in such a case?"</p> 
<p>"Who indeed?" exclaimed Prince S.</p> 
<p>"I shall certainly go mad, if I stay here!" cried Lizabetha Prokofievna.</p> 
<p>"It reminds me," said Evgenie Pavlovitch, laughing, "of the famous plea of a certain lawyer who lately defended a man for murdering six people in order to rob them. He excused his client on the score of poverty. 'It is quite natural,' he said in conclusion, 'considering the state of misery he was in, that he should have thought of murdering these six people; which of you, gentlemen, would not have done the same in his place?'"</p> 
<p>"Enough," cried Lizabetha Prokofievna abruptly, trembling with anger, "we have had enough of this balderdash!"</p> 
<p>In a state of terrible excitement she threw back her head, with flaming eyes, casting looks of contempt and defiance upon the whole company, in which she could no longer distinguish friend from foe. She had restrained herself so long that she felt forced to vent her rage on somebody. Those who knew Lizabetha Prokofievna saw at once how it was with her. "She flies into these rages sometimes," said Ivan Fedorovitch to Prince S. the next day, "but she is not often so violent as she was yesterday; it does not happen more than once in three years."</p> 
<p>"Be quiet, Ivan Fedorovitch! Leave me alone!" cried Mrs. Epanchin. "Why do you offer me your arm now? You had not sense enough to take me away before. You are my husband, you are a father, it was your duty to drag me away by force, if in my folly I refused to obey you and go quietly. You might at least have thought of your daughters. We can find our way out now without your help. Here is shame enough for a year! Wait a moment 'till I thank the prince! Thank you, prince, for the entertainment you have given us! It was most amusing to hear these young men... It is vile, vile! A chaos, a scandal, worse than a nightmare! Is it possible that there can be many such people on earth? Be quiet, Aglaya! Be quiet, Alexandra! It is none of your business! Don't fuss round me like that, Evgenie Pavlovitch; you exasperate me! So, my dear," she cried, addressing the prince, "you go so far as to beg their pardon! He says, 'Forgive me for offering you a fortune.' And you, you mountebank, what are you laughing at?" she cried, turning suddenly on Lebedeff's nephew. "'We refuse ten thousand roubles; we do not beseech, we demand!' As if he did not know that this idiot will call on them tomorrow to renew his offers of money and friendship. You will, won't you? You will? Come, will you, or won't you?"</p> 
<p>"I shall," said the prince, with gentle humility.</p> 
<p>"You hear him! You count upon it, too," she continued, turning upon Doktorenko. "You are as sure of him now as if you had the money in your pocket. And there you are playing the swaggerer to throw dust in our eyes! No, my dear sir, you may take other people in! I can see through all your airs and graces, I see your game!"</p> 
<p>"Lizabetha Prokofievna!" exclaimed the prince.</p> 
<p>"Come, Lizabetha Prokofievna, it is quite time for us to be going, we will take the prince with us," said Prince S. with a smile, in the coolest possible way.</p> 
<p>The girls stood apart, almost frightened; their father was positively horrified. Mrs. Epanchin's language astonished everybody. Some who stood a little way off smiled furtively, and talked in whispers. Lebedeff wore an expression of utmost ecstasy.</p> 
<p>"Chaos and scandal are to be found everywhere, madame," remarked Doktorenko, who was considerably put out of countenance.</p> 
<p>"Not like this! Nothing like the spectacle you have just given us, sir," answered Lizabetha Prokofievna, with a sort of hysterical rage. "Leave me alone, will you?" she cried violently to those around her, who were trying to keep her quiet. "No, Evgenie Pavlovitch, if, as you said yourself just now, a lawyer said in open court that he found it quite natural that a man should murder six people because he was in misery, the world must be coming to an end. I had not heard of it before. Now I understand everything. And this stutterer, won't he turn out a murderer?" she cried, pointing to Burdovsky, who was staring at her with stupefaction. "I bet he will! He will have none of your money, possibly, he will refuse it because his conscience will not allow him to accept it, but he will go murdering you by night and walking off with your cashbox, with a clear conscience! He does not call it a dishonest action but 'the impulse of a noble despair'; 'a negation'; or the devil knows what! Bah! everything is upside down, everyone walks head downwards. A young girl, brought up at home, suddenly jumps into a cab in the middle of the street, saying: 'Good-bye, mother, I married Karlitch, or Ivanitch, the other day!' And you think it quite right? You call such conduct estimable and natural? The 'woman question'? Look here," she continued, pointing to Colia, "the other day that whippersnapper told me that this was the whole meaning of the 'woman question.' But even supposing that your mother is a fool, you are none the less, bound to treat her with humanity. Why did you come here tonight so insolently? 'Give us our rights, but don't dare to speak in our presence. Show us every mark of deepest respect, while we treat you like the scum of the earth.' The miscreants have written a tissue of calumny in their article, and these are the men who seek for truth, and do battle for the right! 'We do not beseech, we demand, you will get no thanks from us, because you will be acting to satisfy your own conscience!' What morality! But, good. heavens! if you declare that the prince's generosity will, excite no gratitude in you, he might answer that he is not, bound to be grateful to Pavlicheff, who also was only satisfying his own conscience. But you counted on the prince's, gratitude towards Pavlicheff; you never lent him any money; he owes you nothing; then what were you counting upon if not on his gratitude? And if you appeal to that sentiment in others, why should you expect to be exempted from it? They are mad! They say society is savage and. inhuman because it despises a young girl who has been seduced. But if you call society inhuman you imply that the young girl is made to suffer by its censure. How then, can you hold her up to the scorn of society in the newspapers without realizing that you are making her suffering, still greater? Madmen! Vain fools! They don't believe in God, they don't believe in Christ! But you are so eaten. up by pride and vanity, that you will end by devouring each other--that is my prophecy! Is not this absurd? Is it not monstrous chaos? And after all this, that shameless creature will go and beg their pardon! Are there many people like you? What are you smiling at? Because I am not ashamed to disgrace myself before you?--Yes, I am disgraced--it can't be helped now! But don't you jeer at me, you scum!" (this was aimed at Hippolyte). "He is almost at his last gasp, yet he corrupts others. You, have got hold of this lad "--(she pointed to Colia); "you, have turned his head, you have taught him to be an atheist, you don't believe in God, and you are not too old to be whipped, sir! A plague upon you! And so, Prince Lef Nicolaievitch, you will call on them tomorrow, will you?" she asked the prince breathlessly, for the second time.</p> 
<p>"Yes."</p> 
<p>"Then I will never speak to you again." She made a sudden movement to go, and then turned quickly back. "And you will call on that atheist?" she continued, pointing to Hippolyte. "How dare you grin at me like that?" she shouted furiously, rushing at the invalid, whose mocking smile drove her to distraction.</p> 
<p>Exclamations arose on all sides.</p> 
<p>"Lizabetha Prokofievna! Lizabetha Prokofievna! Lizabetha Prokofievna!"</p> 
<p>"Mother, this is disgraceful!" cried Aglaya.</p> 
<p>Mrs. Epanchin had approached Hippolyte and seized him firmly by the arm, while her eyes, blazing with fury, were fixed upon his face.</p> 
<p>"Do not distress yourself, Aglaya Ivanovitch," he answered calmly; "your mother knows that one cannot strike a dying man. I am ready to explain why I was laughing. I shall be delighted if you will let me--"</p> 
<p>A violent fit of coughing, which lasted a full minute, prevented him from finishing his sentence.</p> 
<p>"He is dying, yet he will not stop holding forth!" cried Lizabetha Prokofievna. She loosed her hold on his arm, almost terrified, as she saw him wiping the blood from his lips. "Why do you talk? You ought to go home to bed."</p> 
<p>"So I will," he whispered hoarsely. "As soon as I get home I will go to bed at once; and I know I shall be dead in a fortnight; Botkine told me so himself last week. That is why I should like to say a few farewell words, if you will let me."</p> 
<p>"But you must be mad! It is ridiculous! You should take care of yourself; what is the use of holding a conversation now? Go home to bed, do!" cried Mrs. Epanchin in horror.</p> 
<p>"When I do go to bed I shall never get up again," said Hippolyte, with a smile. "I meant to take to my bed yesterday and stay there till I died, but as my legs can still carry me, I put it off for two days, so as to come here with them to-day--but I am very tired."</p> 
<p>"Oh, sit down, sit down, why are you standing?"</p> 
<p>Lizabetha Prokofievna placed a chair for him with her own hands.</p> 
<p>"Thank you," he said gently. "Sit opposite to me, and let us talk. We must have a talk now, Lizabetha Prokofievna; I am very anxious for it." He smiled at her once more. "Remember that today, for the last time, I am out in the air, and in the company of my fellow-men, and that in a fortnight I shall I certainly be no longer in this world. So, in a way, this is my farewell to nature and to men. I am not very sentimental, but do you know, I am quite glad that all this has happened at Pavlofsk, where at least one can see a green tree."</p> 
<p>"But why talk now?" replied Lizabetha Prokofievna, more and more alarmed; "are quite feverish. Just now you would not stop shouting, and now you can hardly breathe. You are gasping."</p> 
<p>"I shall have time to rest. Why will you not grant my last wish? Do you know, Lizabetha Prokofievna, that I have dreamed of meeting you for a long while? I had often heard of you from Colia; he is almost the only person who still comes to see me. You are an original and eccentric woman; I have seen that for myself--Do you know, I have even been rather fond of you?"</p> 
<p>"Good heavens! And I very nearly struck him!"</p> 
<p>"You were prevented by Aglaya Ivanovna. I think I am not mistaken? That is your daughter, Aglaya Ivanovna? She is so beautiful that I recognized her directly, although I had never seen her before. Let me, at least, look on beauty for the last time in my life," he said with a wry smile. "You are here with the prince, and your husband, and a large company. Why should you refuse to gratify my last wish?"</p> 
<p>"Give me a chair!" cried Lizabetha Prokofievna, but she seized one for herself and sat down opposite to Hippolyte. "Colia, you must go home with him," she commanded and tomorrow I will come my self. "</p> 
<p>"Will you let me ask the prince for a cup of tea?... I am exhausted. Do you know what you might do, Lizabetha Prokofievna? I think you wanted to take the prince home with you for tea. Stay here, and let us spend the evening together. I am sure the prince will give us all some tea. Forgive me for being so free and easy-- but I know you are kind, and the prince is kind, too. In fact, we are all good-natured people--it is really quite comical."</p> 
<p>The prince bestirred himself to give orders. Lebedeff hurried out, followed by Vera.</p> 
<p>"It is quite true," said Mrs. Epanchin decisively. "Talk, but not too loud, and don't excite yourself. You have made me sorry for you. Prince, you don't deserve that I should stay and have tea with you, yet I will, all the same, but I won't apologize. I apologize to nobody! Nobody! It is absurd! However, forgive me, prince, if I blew you up--that is, if you like, of course. But please don't let me keep anyone," she added suddenly to her husband and daughters, in a tone of resentment, as though they had grievously offended her. "I can come home alone quite well."</p> 
<p>But they did not let her finish, and gathered round her eagerly. The prince immediately invited everyone to stay for tea, and apologized for not having thought of it before. The general murmured a few polite words, and asked Lizabetha Prokofievna if she did not feel cold on the terrace. He very nearly asked Hippolyte how long he had been at the University, but stopped himself in time. Evgenie Pavlovitch and Prince S. suddenly grew extremely gay and amiable. Adelaida and Alexandra had not recovered from their surprise, but it was now mingled with satisfaction; in short, everyone seemed very much relieved that Lizabetha Prokofievna had got over her paroxysm. Aglaya alone still frowned, and sat apart in silence. All the other guests stayed on as well; no one wanted to go, not even General Ivolgin, but Lebedeff said something to him in passing which did not seem to please him, for he immediately went and sulked in a corner. The prince took care to offer tea to Burdovsky and his friends as well as the rest. The invitation made them rather uncomfortable. They muttered that they would wait for Hippolyte, and went and sat by themselves in a distant corner of the verandah. Tea was served at once; Lebedeff had no doubt ordered it for himself and his family before the others arrived. It was striking eleven.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>“您当然不会否认，”加夫里拉·阿尔达利诺维奇直接对全神贯注听着他讲话的布尔多夫斯基开始说，而布尔多夫斯基却对他惊讶得瞪着眼，并明显地处于强烈的慌乱之中，“您不会，当然也不想正式否认，您是在您尊敬的父亲和十等文官布尔多夫斯基先生即您的父亲合法结婚后过了整整两年才出生的。您出生的时间在事实上是太容易证实了，因此在凯勒尔先生的文章中歪曲这一事实，对您和您母亲来说是莫大的侮辱，这只能解释为凯勤尔先生本人的想象力太轻飘，他以为这样可以更能说明您的权利无可争议，也就能保护您的利益。凯勒尔先生说，他事先给您念过文章，虽然没有全念。毫无疑问，他没有给您念到这个地方……”</p> 
<p>“没有念到，确实如此，”拳击手打断说，“但是所有的事实都是一位权威性人士告诉我的，我就……”</p> 
<p>“对不起，凯勒尔先生，”加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇阻止他说，“请让我说。请相信，到时候还会谈到您的文章，那时您再作解释。现在最好还是按顺序继续说下去。十分偶然，在我妹妹瓦尔瓦拉·阿尔达利翁诺夫娜·普季岑娜的帮助下，我从她的好友，女地主妇维拉·可列克谢耶夫娜·祖布科娃那里得到已故的尼古拉· 安德列耶维奇·帕夫利谢夫的一封信，这是２４年前他从国外写给她的。在与维拉·阿列克谢耶夫娜结识以后，按照她的指点，我找了退役上校季莫菲·费奥多罗维奇·维亚佐夫金，他是帕夫利谢夫先生的远亲，当时是他的十分要好的朋友。从他那里我又得到尼古拉。安德列耶维奇从国外写来的两封信，根据这三封信，根据信中所写的日期和事实，没有任何反驳和怀疑的可能，可以确凿地证明，尼古拉·安德列耶维奇当时到国外去了（在那里连续ｇｒＴ年），布尔多夫斯基先生，那是在您出生俞一年半的事。您也知道，您母亲从来也没有离开过俄国……此刻我不想念这几封信。现在已经不早了。我只是宣布了起码的事实。但是，布尔多夫斯基先生，如果您愿意约定个时间，哪怕是明天上午到我部里会晤，并把您的证人（人数随便）以及鉴定笔迹专家带来，我也丝毫不怀疑，您会不能不相信我所说的事实是无可争议的真情。既然这样，那么这一件事当然也就不攻自破，自然而然终止了结。”</p> 
<p>接着大家又是一阵骚动，人人显得极为激动。布尔多夫斯基本人突然从椅子上站了起来。</p> 
<p>“如果是这样，那么我受骗了，受骗了，但不是受切巴罗夫的骗，而是很久很久前就受骗了；我不要鉴定专家，也不要证人，我相信，我放弃……１万卢布我也不要了……告辞了……”</p> 
<p>他拿起帽子，移开椅子，准备离去。</p> 
<p>“如果可能的活，布尔多夫斯基先生，”加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇温惋悦耳地留住他，“那么就再留哪怕５分钟。因为这件事还发现了几件非常重要的事实，特别对于你来说很有关系，无论如何是相当令人好奇的。照我看来您不能不了解这些事实，如果事情完全弄清楚，也许您本人会更感到高兴……”</p> 
<p>布尔多夫斯基默默地坐了下来，稍稍低着头，仿佛陷于深深的沉恩之中。列别杰夫的外甥本来站起来打算送布尔多夫斯基的，现在紧随其后也坐了下来，他虽然没有张惶失措和失去勇气，但看得出来，显得十分困惑不解。伊波利特皱着眉头，忧心忡忡，仿佛非常惊讶。不过就在此刻他咳得十分厉害，甚至咯出的血都弄脏了手帕。拳击手则几乎惊惧不已。</p> 
<p>“哎，安季普！”他苦恼地喊着，“我那时……即前天就对你说过，你可能真的不是帕夫利谢夫的儿子。”</p> 
<p>响起了一阵有克制的笑声，有两三个人笑得比别人响。</p> 
<p>“凯勒尔先生，刚才您所说的这一事实相当宝贵，”加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇接过话茬说，“然而，根据最确切的材料，我有充分的权利肯定，布尔多夫斯基先生虽然无疑十分清楚自己出生的时间，但是却根本不了解帕夫利谢夫先生曾经在国外耽过而且在那里度过了大半生、只是短期回国这一情况。此外，当时他去国外这件事本身也十分平常，因此在二十多年以后连跟帕夫利谢夫很熟的人也不记得这一点，更不用说布尔多夫斯基先生了，因为他那时还未出世。当然，现在要进行查询也不是不可能；但是我应该承认，我所得到的查询结果完全是很偶然搞来的，而且本来很可能搞不到；因此，对于布尔多夫斯基先生，甚至对于切巴罗夫来说，假如他们想要查询，那么这种查询也确实几乎是不可能的。但是他们可能也没有想到要……”</p> 
<p>“请问，伊沃尔京先生，”突然伊波利特气乎乎地打断他说，“说这一大堆废话（请原谅）干什么？现在事情已经解释清楚了，我们也愿意相信主要的事实，何必还要把这令人难受和使人委屈的无聊事继续拖延下去呢？也许，您是想炫耀您调查手段之机灵，想在我们面前和公爵面前显示出您是多好的侦民包打听？或者因为布尔多夫斯基不知究竟卷进了这件事里，您打算原谅和开脱他？但是，阁下，这太胆大妄为了：布尔多夫斯基不需要您的辩解和原谅，但愿您知道这一点！他感到屈辱，他现在已够难受的了，他处境很尴尬，您应该估计到、理解到这一点……”</p> 
<p>“够了，捷连季耶夫先生，够了，”加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇总算打断了他的话；“您镇静些，别使自己发火；好像，您身体很不好吧？我很同情您（这种情况下）如果您愿意，我就结束、也就是说，我不得不只是扼要地告诉你们那些我确认即使是了解全部详情也不为多余的事实，”他发现大家似乎不耐烦而有所动弹，便补充说，“我只想凭证据让所有与此事有关的人知道布尔多夫斯基先生，您的母亲之所以是唯一赢得帕夫利谢夫好感和关心的人，是因为她是尼古拉·安德列耶维奇·帕夫利谢夫在青春年少时爱上的那个婢女的亲妹妹，他当时爱得那么深，要不是她突然夭逝，他一定会跟她结婚的。我有证据表朋，这一完全确凿和可靠的家庭事实很少为人所知，甚至完全被遗忘了。下面我可以解释，您母亲还是个１０岁的孩子时就由帕夫利谢夫先生当作系属加以托养，给她拨出相当可观的款项作嫁妆，所有这些关心在帕夫利谢夫众多的亲属中产生了异常令人惶惶不安的传闻；他们甚至认为，他在跟自己抚养的女孩结婚，但是结果是，她按自己的意愿（我可以以最确凿的方式来证明这一点）嫁给了测地公务员布尔多夫斯基先生，那是她２０岁那年，我这里搜集了几件确切的事实可以证明，布尔多夫斯基先生，您的父亲根本就不是一个能干的人，他得到您母亲一万五千卢布的陪嫁以后，放弃了公务投身于商业，却受了欺骗，丢掉了资本，他经不住痛苦，便开始喝酒，结果就病了，最后过早就离世了，那是他跟您母亲结婚的第八年。后来，据您母亲亲口所说，她落得非常贫困，假如没有帕夫利谢夫经常慷慨地资助，每年提供给她６００卢布，她肯定早死了。后来有无数材料证明，他异常爱孩提时的您。根据这些材料又加上您母亲的证实可以得出结论，他爱您主要是因为您在童年时说话口齿不清，像个残疾人，一副可怜不幸的样子，而帕夫利谢夫，根据确凿的证据我认为，是个一生对所有受压迫的和生来就先天有缺陷的人，特别是孩子，怀有一种特别柔爱的心肠，这个事实，我确信，对于我，这件事是异常重要的了。最后，我凭所作的确切调查可以夸口说弄清了一个主要事实，即帕夫利谢夫对您的这种异常的关切怜爱（他设法让您进了中学并使您在特殊监护下进行学习）渐渐地终于在亲戚和家人中间产生了种想法，您是他的儿子，您的父亲只是个受骗的丈夫。但是，主要的是，这个想法是在帕夫利谢夫生前最后几年才加强并成为一种大家都接受的确凿无疑的观念而固定下来，这时大家都为遗嘱担惊受怕，而原始的事实却被遗忘了，查询又不可能。毫无疑问，这一想法也传到了您这儿。布尔多夫斯基先生，而且完全左右着您。我有幸亲自认识您的母亲，她虽然知道这一切流言蜚语，但是却至今还不知道（我也向她隐瞒了），您，她的儿子，居然还受这种流言的诱惑。布尔多夫斯基先生，我在普斯科夫见到您那令人尊敬的母亲，她正疾病缠身，在帕夫利谢夫死后陷于极为贫困的境地，她流着感激的眼泪告诉我，她现在靠您和您的帮助才活在世上；她对您的未来寄予厚望，并且热烈地相信您在未来会取得成就……”</p> 
<p>“这实在叫人难以容忍！”突然列别杰夫的外甥不耐烦地大声宣称道，“所有这一切长篇大论干什么？”</p> 
<p>“令人厌恶，不成体统！”伊波利特做着强烈的动作忿忿说。但布尔多夫斯基却什么也没说，甚至也没动一下。</p> 
<p>“干什么？为了什么？”加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇狡黠地表示惊讶说，他已经准备好说出自己的结论，“第一，布尔多夫斯基先生现在也许能完全相信，帕夫利谢夫先生是出于慷慨大度才爱他，而不是把他作为儿子。布尔多夫斯基先生必须知道这一事实，因为刚才读了文章后他曾肯定并赞同凯勒尔先生。我之所以这样说，是因为我认为您是个高尚的人，布尔多夫斯基先生。第二，这件事原来根本不存在丝毫欺诈和欺骗，甚至连切巴罗夫也没有。这一点甚至对我来说也很重要，因为刚才公爵一时焦躁提到，似乎我也认为这件不幸的事是欺诈和欺骗。相反，这件事从各个方面来看都可以使人充分相信，即使切巴罗夫也许真的是个大骗子，但这件事中他顶多是个刁钻狡猾的讼吏，卖弄笔杆的墨客，图谋非利的小人。他作为律师企望榨取大钱，而他的盘算不仅精明、老练，而且极为可靠：他认准了公爵给钱出手松，认准了他对已故的帕夫利谢夫怀有感激敬佩之情，最后，也是最重要的，他认准了公爵在正直和良心的责任感这点上持有一定程度的骑士观点，至于说到布尔多夫斯基先生本人，那么甚至可以说，由于他自己深信不疑，因此完全受切巴罗夫和他周围一伙人的影响，以至他开始做这件事几乎完全不是为了得到利益，而差不多是将这件事看作是为真理、进步和人类效劳，现在，在告知了事实以后，大家想必明白，尽管有种种表面现象，布尔多夫斯基先生却是个清白的人，而公爵也会比原先更情愿更乐意向他提供友好的帮助以及刚才在谈到创办纪念帕夫利谢夫的学校时他所提出的实际的支持。”</p> 
<p>“请停下来，加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇，请别说了！”公爵真正惊恐地喊道，可是已经晚了。</p> 
<p>“我说了，我已经说了三遍了，”布尔多夫斯基气急败坏地嚷道，“我不要钱。我不会接受……为了什么……我不要……就是这么回事！……”</p> 
<p>说完他几乎要从露台上跑下去。但列别杰夫的外甥抓住了他的手，对他轻声低语了什么。他很快又折了回来，从口袋里掏出一只未加封的大信封，将它丢在公爵旁边的小桌子上。</p> 
<p>“这是钱！……不许您……不许您！……钱！……”</p> 
<p>“２５０卢布，就是您竟敢通过切巴罗夫以施舍的方式寄给他的钱，”多克切连科解释说。</p> 
<p>“在文章里说是５０！”科利亚喊道。</p> 
<p>“是我不好！”公爵走近布尔多夫斯基说，“布尔多夫斯基，我很对不起您，但我绝不是作为施舍给您的，请相信我。我现在也不好，刚才也有不是。（公爵情绪很激动，看起来很疲惫、虚弱，说话也不连贯。）我说过欺骗的事……但这不是讲您，我错了。我说，您……像我一样，是个有病的人。但是实际上您并不像我这样，您……给人上课，您赡养母亲。我说，您败坏了您母亲的名声，但是实际上您是爱她的；这是她亲自说的……我不知道……刚才加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇没有对我说完……我有过错。我还擅自向您提供１万卢布，可是我错了，我本应该不以这样的方式来做，而现在……不能做了，因为您鄙视我……”</p> 
<p>“这里真是所疯人院了！”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜喊了起来。</p> 
<p>“当然是疯人院！”阿格拉娅忍不住也尖刻地说，但她的活淹没在众人的喧哗声中，大家已经大声地谈起话来，人人都在议论，有的在争辩，有的在笑。伊万·费奥多罗维奇·叶潘钦已到了怒不可遏的地步，同时则又摆出尊严受到侮辱的神态等待着叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜：列别杰夫的外甥插嘴说了最后几句活：</p> 
<p>“是的，公爵，应该为您说句公道话，您确实很善于利用您的……这么说吧，疾病（这样说体面些）；您以这样活络的形式提供您的友谊和金钱，使得任何一个高尚的人无论如何也不会接受它们。这样做要么是太天真，要么是太狡猾……您其实心里更清楚。”</p> 
<p>“对不起，诸位，”加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇把装在信封里的一包钱打开，高呼道，“这里根本不是２５０卢布，总共只有１００。公爵，我是为了免得造成什么疑惑。”</p> 
<p>“别管它，算了，”公爵朝加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇直挥着手。</p> 
<p>“不，不能‘算了’，”列别杰夫立即盯住不放说，“公爵，您这一声‘算了’是对我们的侮辱。我们不会躲躲闪闪，我们公开宣布：是的，这里只有１００卢布、而不是２５０卢布总数，但是，这难道不一样吗……”</p> 
<p>“不，不一样，”加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇故作莫名其妙的样子插话说。</p> 
<p>“请别打断我；我们不是您认为的那种傻瓜，律师先生，”列别杰夫的外甥又气愤又恼恨地高声说，“当然， １００卢布不等于２５０卢布，不是一样的，但是重要的是原则；这里主动精神是首要的，而缺１５０卢布，这只是细节问题。重要的是，布尔多夫斯基没有接受您的施舍，阁下，他当面扔回给您，在这种意义上１００和２５０是一样的。布尔多夫斯基没有接受１万卢布；你是看到的；假若他不是个正直的人，那么他也不会带来１００卢布！另外１５０卢布是他在切巴罗夫到公爵那儿去的开销上。您尽可以笑我们不精明，笑我们不会办事；没有这些您也已竭尽全力把我们弄成极为可笑的人；但是不许您说我们是不正直的人。这１５０卢布，阁下，我们大家一起会付还给您的；我们哪怕是一个卢布一个卢布地也要还，而且要付利息。布尔多夫斯基是个穷光蛋，布尔多夫斯基没有百万家财，而切巴罗夫在出差后提交了账单，我们原指望会赢……谁处在他的地位会不这样做。”</p> 
<p>“谁又怎么样？”ω公爵嚷了起来。</p> 
<p>“我在这儿真要发疯了！”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜喊道。</p> 
<p>“这使人想起，”长时间站在一旁观察着的叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇笑起来说，“不久前那位律师的有名的辩护词。他的当事人欲抢劫而一下子杀害了六口人。律师却搬出他贫穷这一点作为理由，并一下子作了这一类的结论：自然，他说，我的当事人因为贫穷而冒出了杀害六口人的念头，处在他的地位谁不会冒出这种念头呢？’类似这样的话，只不过很可笑。”</p> 
<p>“够了！”几乎气愤得打颤的叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜突然宣布说，“该中断这种胡言乱语了！……”</p> 
<p>她激愤万分，威严地仰着头，摆出一副高傲、热切和急迫的挑衅姿态，用炯炯目光扫视着所有在场的人，此刻她未必区分开谁是朋友谁是敌人。这正是克制了很久但终于陡起愤怒的爆发，在这种时候渴求立即投入战斗、立即尽快地朝什么人扑去，成为主要的动机。了解叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜的人马上就感觉到，她发生了某种异常的情况。伊万·费奥多罗维奇第二天曾对出公爵说过，“她有时是会有这种状况，但是像昨天这种程度她却是少有的，大概三年发一次，无论如何不会更多了！无论如何不会更多了！”他为了使人明白添加了一句。</p> 
<p>“够了，伊万·费奥多罗维奇！别管我！”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜高声喊着，“您于吗现在才把您的手凑近来？您不会刚才就带我走；您是丈夫，是一家之主，如果我不听您的，不肯定，您应该揪住我这个傻女人的耳朵把我拖走。哪怕是为了女儿操操心！而现在没有您我们也找得到路，这种耻辱够我消受整整一年…… 等一等，我还想感谢公爵！……谢谢您的款待，公爵。而我却随便坐在这里听年青人讲话……这简直是卑鄙，卑鄙！这简直是乱七八槽，不成体统，连做梦也不曾见到过这种样子！难道他们这样的人很少？……别作声！阿格拉娅！别作声，亚历山德拉！这不关我们的事！……别在我身边转来转去，叶甫盖尼·帕夫雷奇，您使我讨厌！……这么说，亲爱的，您是在请求他们原谅，”她转向公爵，重又接着前面的话题说，“说什么‘是我不好，竟敢向您提供钱财’……你这张贫嘴有什么好笑的！”她突然又冲着列别杰夫外甥说，“说什么，我们拒绝钱财，我们是要求，而不是乞求！仿佛不知道，这个白痴明天就会到他们那里去向他们提供友情和金钱！你会去吗？去还是不去？”</p> 
<p>“我会去的，”公爵心平气和地说。</p> 
<p>“听到了吧！你也正是估计到了这一着，”她又转向多克托连科说，“现在钱就跟在你口袋里一样，所以你尽可以耍贫嘴来蒙骗我们……不，小伙子，去找别的傻瓜吧，我可是看透你们了……我看穿了你们的整套把戏！”</p> 
<p>“叶莉扎维塔·普里科菲耶夫娜！”公爵大声喊着。</p> 
<p>“我们离开这儿吧，叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜，早就该走了，我们把公爵也带走，”ω公爵尽量平静地微笑着说。</p> 
<p>小姐们站在一旁，几乎被吓坏了：将军则完全被吓坏了；所有的人都惊诧不已。站得远些的人暗良好笑，窃窃私语；列别杰夫脸上流露出极为欣喜的神色。</p> 
<p>“夫人，不成体统和乱七八糟到处都可以找到，”列别杰夫的外甥相当窘困地说。</p> 
<p>“可是不像这样的！不像你们现在这样的，先生们，不是这样的！”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜像歇斯底里发作似的幸灾乐祸地接口说，“你们别管我，”她对劝说她的人喊叫着，“不，叶甫盖尼·帕夫雷奇，连您自己刚才也声称，在法庭上甚至辩护律师本人都宣告，因为贫穷而杀死六口人是最自然不过的事，那么真的世界末日来临了。我还没有听说过这样的立论，现在我是一切都明白了！瞧这个话也说不清楚的人，难道他不会杀人（她指着大惑不解地望着她的布尔多夫斯基）？我敢打赌，他会杀的！你的钱，一万卢布，他大概是不会拿的，也许是出于良心的考虑而不拿，而夜里他会再来井杀人，再从匣子里取走钱。也是出于良心的考虑而取走钱！这对他来说并不觉得可耻！这是‘高尚的绝望的冲动’，这是一种‘否定’，或者鬼知道是什么说法……去它的！……一切都反过来了，一切都颠倒了。一个姑娘在家里长大了，突然在街中间跳上了轻便马车，喊着：‘妈妈，前几天我嫁给了某个卡尔雷奇或者伊万内奇，再见了！，照你们看来，这样做也是好的暗？自然，也是值得尊敬的喏？妇女问题？瞧这个男孩（她指着科利亚），不久前他也在争辩说，这就是‘妇女问题’。即使母亲是傻瓜，你终究会像人一样对待她！……你们刚才进来的时候凭什么神气活现的？一副‘不许挡道，我们来了’的架势。‘把所有的权利都给我们，可是不许你在我们面前吭一声。把所有的恭敬，甚至过去也没有的敬意给我们，而我们将把你当作最下等的奴仆也不如！’一直在探求真理，维护权利，可是在文章中却又像异教徒那样诬蔑它。‘是要求而不是乞求，而且您不会从我们这儿听到任何感谢的，因为您是为了满足自己的良心才这么做的！’好一种德性呀：既然从你那里不会有任何感谢，那么么爵也可以回答你说，他对帕夫利谢夫没有丝毫感激之情，因为帕夫利谢夫的善事也是为了满足个人的良心。可是你算计的又恰恰就是他对帕夫利谢夫的感激之情，要知道，他既没有向你借钱，也没有欠你债，你不在他的感激之情上打主意又能打什么主意？你怎么能自己否定它呢？真是一群疯子！会被认为野蛮、不人道是因为它污辱了一个受诱骗的姑娘，可是既然你承认社会不人道，那么也就会承认这个社会使这个姑娘感到痛苦。而既然痛苦，那你自己又怎么在报上把她的事端到这个社会面前并要求她对此不要感到痛苦？真是一群疯子！一群好虚荣的疯子！不信上帝，不信基督！要知道，虚荣和骄傲把你们至蚀透了，结果你们便互相至蚀光，我这是预先警告你们。这不是乱了套了，不是乱七八糟，不是不成体统吗？可是发生了这一切之后这个不顾脸面的入竟还拼命求着他们原谅！像你们这样的人有许多吗？你们算什么，笑我跟你们在一起丢了自己的脸吗？我反正已经丢了脸，没有别的办法了！……你别笑，坏东西！（她突然冲着伊波利特喊着）自己都只剩一口气了，还要腐蚀别人。你腐蚀了我这个孩子（她又指了下科利亚）；他一个劲地说胡话夸你，你教他无神论，你不信上帝，简直可以打你一顿，阁下，去他们的吧！……这么说，列夫·尼古拉耶维奇，你明天要去他们那儿，去吗？”她几乎上气不接下气地又间公爵。</p> 
<p>“我要去的。……”</p> 
<p>“要是这样，我不想认识你了！”她本已很快地转过身走了，但又突然回来，“你要到这个无神论者那里去吗？”她指着伊波利特问，“你冲我笑什么！”她有点不自然地大声嚷着，受不了他那刻毒的冷笑，突然朝他扑去。</p> 
<p>“叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜！叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜！叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜！”顿时四周响起一片呼声。</p> 
<p>“妈妈，这多难为情呀！”阿格拉娅大声喊了起来。</p> 
<p>“别担心，阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜，”伊波利特平静地回答说，叶莉扎维塔·晋罗科菲耶夫娜跳到他身边，抓住他，且不知为什么紧紧地抓住他的一只胳膊；她站在他面前，用疯狂的日光逼视他，“别担心，您妈妈会明白，不能扑向一个垂死的人……我愿意解释，为什么我笑……我将很乐意得到许可”</p> 
<p>这时他突然拼命咳嗽起来，整整一分钟都未能平息。</p> 
<p>“人都快要死了，还老是夸夸其谈！”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜嚷着，她放开了他的胳膊，几乎是恐惧地望着他擦去自己嘴唇上的鲜血，“你还说什么呀！你干脆去躺着吧……”</p> 
<p>“会这样的，”伊波利特轻轻地回答，他声音沙娅，几乎是喃喃着说，“我今天一回去，马上就躺下……过两个星期，据我所知，就会死的……上星期博特金亲自对我宣布的……所以，如果允许的话，我要对你们说两句话以作告别。”</p> 
<p>“你疯了怎么的？尽胡说！应该治病，现在还说什么话！走吧，走吧，去躺着！……”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜惊惶地喊着。</p> 
<p>“我会去躺的，可是就不会再起来了，直至死去，”伊波利特凄然一笑，“昨天我就已经想这么躺下，不再起来，直至死去，可又决定延迟到后天，趁两条腿还能撑得往……为的是今天跟他们一起到这里来……只不过已经很累了……”</p> 
<p>“坐下吧，坐下吧，干吗站着！喏，给你椅子，”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜急忙奔过去，亲自给他放了把椅子。</p> 
<p>“谢谢您，”伊波利特轻轻地继续说着，“您请坐在对面，我们这就谈谈……我们一定得谈谈，叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜，现在我可是坚持这一点的……”他又朝她凳尔一笑，“请想想，今天我是最后一次到外面来和跟人们在一起，而过两个星期大概就不行了。就是说，这好像是跟人们跟大自然的告别。我虽然不太易动感情，可是，你们瞧，这一切发生在帕夫洛夫斯克这里，我很高兴，因为毕竟可以看看树叶婆娑的树木。”</p> 
<p>“现在还说什么话吗？”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜越来越骇怕，“你浑身发烧。刚才叽哩叽哩尖声尖气说一通，现在勉强才能换口气，气都喘不过来了！”</p> 
<p>“马上就休息。为什么您想拒绝我这最后的愿望呢？……您知道吗，叶莉扎维塔·普罗科匪耶夫娜，我早就已经怀着无论如何要跟您见一见的愿望了；我从科利亚那儿听说了不少有关您的事；他几乎是唯一没有撇下我的人……您是位独特的妇女，古怪的妇女，我现在亲自见到了……知道吗，我甚至有点喜欢您。”</p> 
<p>“上帝啊，我刚才差点打了他，真的。”</p> 
<p>“阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜阻止了您；我没有错吧？这是您女儿阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜？她是这么漂亮，我刚才一眼就猜到是她了，虽然过去从未见边面。请让我哪怕是活着最后一次看看这位美人，”伊波利特有点不自然地强笑了一下，“公爵也在这里，还有您丈夫，大伙儿都在。为什么您要拒绝我的最后愿望呢？”</p> 
<p>“椅子！”叶莉扎维塔·普罗得菲耶夫娜喊了一声，但她自己抓了一把椅子，就在伊波利特对面坐下了，“科利亚，”她吩咐说，“你马上就与他走吧，送送他；明天我一定亲自……”</p> 
<p>“如果您许可，我想请公爵给我一杯茶……我非常累。知道吧，叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜，你好像想把公爵带到自己那里去喝茶，您请留在这儿，我们一起再度过些时光，公爵一定会给我们大家上茶的。请原谅我这样安排……但是我了解您，您很善良，公爵也是……我们大家都是善良得可笑的大好人……”</p> 
<p>公爵非常惊恐不安，列别杰夫慌忙从房间里飞奔出去，维拉跟在他后面跑了出去。</p> 
<p>“真的，”将军夫人断然决定，“你说吧，只是说轻些，别冲动。你真让我怜悯……公爵！你本来是不配留我在你这几喝茶的，可是就这样吧，我留下来，虽然我不想向任何人道歉！不向任何人！那简直是荒谬！……不过，如果我骂了你，公爵，那么就请原谅，……不过，假如你愿意的话，其实，我谁也不强留，”突然她异常愤怒地对丈夫和女儿们说，仿佛他们在什么事情上大大得罪了她似的，“我一个人到得了家的……”</p> 
<p>但是没有让她讲完。大家都走近跟前，乐意地围住她。公爵马上恳求大家留下来喝茶，并且一再表示歉意，直到现在才想到这一点。连将军也非常客气，嘀咕着说了些劝慰的话，又亲切地问叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜：“在露台上是不是太凉了？”他甚至几乎要问伊波利特：“上大学是否很久了？”，但是他没有问。叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇和出公爵也突然变得殷切可亲、兴致快活，阿杰莱达和亚历山德拉脸上除了依然留有一丝惊讶，竟然也流露出满意的神色，总之，大家显然都为叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜的危机过去了而感到高兴。唯有阿格拉娅一人皱眉蹙额，默默地坐在稍远些的地方。所有其他的人也都留下了；谁也不想离开，连伊沃尔京将军也是，不过列别杰夫顺便对他低语了什么，想必是不大愉快的事，因此将军立即退居到角落里去了。公爵也走到布尔多夫斯基及其伙伴们跟前，一个也不遗漏地请喝茶。他们显出不自然的样子低声说要等伊波利特，便立即躲到露台最过的一个角落里去，又一起并排坐了下来。大概列别杰夫早就为自己准备好了茶，因此立即就端了上来。这时敲响了１１点。</p>
