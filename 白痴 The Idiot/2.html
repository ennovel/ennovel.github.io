Besides this large residence--five-sixths of which was let in flats and lodgings-the general was owner of another enormous house in the Sadovaya bringing in even more rent than the first. Besides these houses he had a delightful little estate just out of town, and some sort of factory in another part of the city. General Epanchin, as everyone knew, had a good deal to do with certain government monopolies; he was also a voice, and an important one, in many rich public companies of various descriptions; in fact, he enjoyed the reputation of being a well- to-do man of busy habits, many ties, and affluent means. He had made himself indispensable in several quarters, amongst others in his department of the government; and yet it was a known fact that Fedor Ivanovitch Epanchin was a man of no education whatever, and had absolutely risen from the ranks.</p> 
<p>This last fact could, of course, reflect nothing but credit upon the general; and yet, though unquestionably a sagacious man, he had his own little weaknesses-very excusable ones,--one of which was a dislike to any allusion to the above circumstance. He was undoubtedly clever. For instance, he made a point of never asserting himself when he would gain more by keeping in the background; and in consequence many exalted personages valued him principally for his humility and simplicity, and because "he knew his place." And yet if these good people could only have had a peep into the mind of this excellent fellow who "knew his place" so well! The fact is that, in spite of his knowledge of the world and his really remarkable abilities, he always liked to appear to be carrying out other people's ideas rather than his own. And also, his luck seldom failed him, even at cards, for which he had a passion that he did not attempt to conceal. He played for high stakes, and moved, altogether, in very varied society.</p> 
<p>As to age, General Epanchin was in the very prime of life; that is, about fifty-five years of age,--the flowering time of existence, when real enjoyment of life begins. His healthy appearance, good colour, sound, though discoloured teeth, sturdy figure, preoccupied air during business hours, and jolly good humour during his game at cards in the evening, all bore witness to his success in life, and combined to make existence a bed of roses to his excellency. The general was lord of a flourishing family, consisting of his wife and three grown-up daughters. He had married young, while still a lieutenant, his wife being a girl of about his own age, who possessed neither beauty nor education, and who brought him no more than fifty souls of landed property, which little estate served, however, as a nest-egg for far more important accumulations. The general never regretted his early marriage, or regarded it as a foolish youthful escapade; and he so respected and feared his wife that he was very near loving her. Mrs. Epanchin came of the princely stock of Muishkin, which if not a brilliant, was, at all events, a decidedly ancient family; and she was extremely proud of her descent.</p> 
<p>With a few exceptions, the worthy couple had lived through their long union very happily. While still young the wife had been able to make important friends among the aristocracy, partly by virtue of her family descent, and partly by her own exertions; while, in after life, thanks to their wealth and to the position of her husband in the service, she took her place among the higher circles as by right.</p> 
<p>During these last few years all three of the general's daughters- Alexandra, Adelaida, and Aglaya--had grown up and matured. Of course they were only Epanchins, but their mother's family was noble; they might expect considerable fortunes; their father had hopes of attaining to very high rank indeed in his country's service-all of which was satisfactory. All three of the girls were decidedly pretty, even the eldest, Alexandra, who was just twenty-five years old. The middle daughter was now twenty-three, while the youngest, Aglaya, was twenty. This youngest girl was absolutely a beauty, and had begun of late to attract considerable attention in society. But this was not all, for every one of the three was clever, well educated, and accomplished.</p> 
<p>It was a matter of general knowledge that the three girls were very fond of one another, and supported each other in every way; it was even said that the two elder ones had made certain sacrifices for the sake of the idol of the household, Aglaya. In society they not only disliked asserting themselves, but were actually retiring. Certainly no one could blame them for being too arrogant or haughty, and yet everybody was well aware that they were proud and quite understood their own value. The eldest was musical, while the second was a clever artist, which fact she had concealed until lately. In a word, the world spoke well of the girls; but they were not without their enemies, and occasionally people talked with horror of the number of books they had read.</p> 
<p>They were in no hurry to marry. They liked good society, but were not too keen about it. All this was the more remarkable, because everyone was well aware of the hopes and aims of their parents.</p> 
<p>It was about eleven o'clock in the forenoon when the prince rang the bell at General Epanchin's door. The general lived on the first floor or flat of the house, as modest a lodging as his position permitted. A liveried servant opened the door, and the prince was obliged to enter into long explanations with this gentleman, who, from the first glance, looked at him and his bundle with grave suspicion. At last, however, on the repeated positive assurance that he really was Prince Muishkin, and must absolutely see the general on business, the bewildered domestic showed him into a little ante-chamber leading to a waiting-room that adjoined the general's study, there handing him over to another servant, whose duty it was to be in this ante-chamber all the morning, and announce visitors to the general. This second individual wore a dress coat, and was some forty years of age; he was the general's special study servant, and well aware of his own importance.</p> 
<p>"Wait in the next room, please; and leave your bundle here," said the door-keeper, as he sat down comfortably in his own easy-chair in the ante-chamber. He looked at the prince in severe surprise as the latter settled himself in another chair alongside, with his bundle on his knees.</p> 
<p>"If you don't mind, I would rather sit here with you," said the prince; "I should prefer it to sitting in there."</p> 
<p>"Oh, but you can't stay here. You are a visitor--a guest, so to speak. Is it the general himself you wish to see?"</p> 
<p>The man evidently could not take in the idea of such a shabby- looking visitor, and had decided to ask once more.</p> 
<p>"Yes--I have business--" began the prince.</p> 
<p>"I do not ask you what your business may be, all I have to do is to announce you; and unless the secretary comes in here I cannot do that."</p> 
<p>The man's suspicions seemed to increase more and more. The prince was too unlike the usual run of daily visitors; and although the general certainly did receive, on business, all sorts and conditions of men, yet in spite of this fact the servant felt great doubts on the subject of this particular visitor. The presence of the secretary as an intermediary was, he judged, essential in this case.</p> 
<p>"Surely you--are from abroad?" he inquired at last, in a confused sort of way. He had begun his sentence intending to say, "Surely you are not Prince Muishkin, are you?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, straight from the train! Did not you intend to say, 'Surely you are not Prince Muishkin?' just now, but refrained out of politeness ?"</p> 
<p>"H'm!" grunted the astonished servant.</p> 
<p>"I assure you I am not deceiving you; you shall not have to answer for me. As to my being dressed like this, and carrying a bundle, there's nothing surprising in that--the fact is, my circumstances are not particularly rosy at this moment."</p> 
<p>"H'm!--no, I'm not afraid of that, you see; I have to announce you, that's all. The secretary will be out directly-that is, unless you--yes, that's the rub--unless you--come, you must allow me to ask you--you've not come to beg, have you?"</p> 
<p>"Oh dear no, you can be perfectly easy on that score. I have quite another matter on hand."</p> 
<p>"You must excuse my asking, you know. Your appearance led me to think--but just wait for the secretary; the general is busy now, but the secretary is sure to come out."</p> 
<p>"Oh--well, look here, if I have some time to wait, would you mind telling me, is there any place about where I could have a smoke? I have my pipe and tobacco with me."</p> 
<p>"SMOKE?" said the man, in shocked but disdainful surprise, blinking his eyes at the prince as though he could not believe his senses." No, sir, you cannot smoke here, and I wonder you are not ashamed of the very suggestion. Ha, ha! a cool idea that, I declare!"</p> 
<p>"Oh, I didn't mean in this room! I know I can't smoke here, of course. I'd adjourn to some other room, wherever you like to show me to. You see, I'm used to smoking a good deal, and now I haven't had a puff for three hours; however, just as you like."</p> 
<p>"Now how on earth am I to announce a man like that?" muttered the servant. "In the first place, you've no right in here at all; you ought to be in the waiting-room, because you're a sort of visitor--a guest, in fact--and I shall catch it for this. Look here, do you intend to take up you abode with us?" he added, glancing once more at the prince's bundle, which evidently gave him no peace.</p> 
<p>"No, I don't think so. I don't think I should stay even if they were to invite me. I've simply come to make their acquaintance, and nothing more."</p> 
<p>"Make their acquaintance?" asked the man, in amazement, and with redoubled suspicion. "Then why did you say you had business with the general?"</p> 
<p>"Oh well, very little business. There is one little matter--some advice I am going to ask him for; but my principal object is simply to introduce myself, because I am Prince Muishkin, and Madame Epanchin is the last of her branch of the house, and besides herself and me there are no other Muishkins left."</p> 
<p>"What--you're a relation then, are you?" asked the servant, so bewildered that he began to feel quite alarmed.</p> 
<p>"Well, hardly so. If you stretch a point, we are relations, of course, but so distant that one cannot really take cognizance of it. I once wrote to your mistress from abroad, but she did not reply. However, I have thought it right to make acquaintance with her on my arrival. I am telling you all this in order to ease your mind, for I see you are still far from comfortable on my account. All you have to do is to announce me as Prince Muishkin, and the object of my visit will be plain enough. If I am received--very good; if not, well, very good again. But they are sure to receive me, I should think; Madame Epanchin will naturally be curious to see the only remaining representative of her family. She values her Muishkin descent very highly, if I am rightly informed."</p> 
<p>The prince's conversation was artless and confiding to a degree, and the servant could not help feeling that as from visitor to common serving-man this state of things was highly improper. His conclusion was that one of two things must be the explanation-- either that this was a begging impostor, or that the prince, if prince he were, was simply a fool, without the slightest ambition; for a sensible prince with any ambition would certainly not wait about in ante-rooms with servants, and talk of his own private affairs like this. In either case, how was he to announce this singular visitor?</p> 
<p>"I really think I must request you to step into the next room!" he said, with all the insistence he could muster.</p> 
<p>"Why? If I had been sitting there now, I should not have had the opportunity of making these personal explanations. I see you are still uneasy about me and keep eyeing my cloak and bundle. Don't you think you might go in yourself now, without waiting for the secretary to come out?"</p> 
<p>"No, no! I can't announce a visitor like yourself without the secretary. Besides the general said he was not to be disturbed-- he is with the Colonel C--. Gavrila Ardalionovitch goes in without announcing."</p> 
<p>"Who may that be? a clerk?"</p> 
<p>"What? Gavrila Ardalionovitch? Oh no; he belongs to one of the companies. Look here, at all events put your bundle down, here."</p> 
<p>"Yes, I will if I may; and--can I take off my cloak"</p> 
<p>"Of course; you can't go in THERE with it on, anyhow."</p> 
<p>The prince rose and took off his mantle, revealing a neat enough morning costume--a little worn, but well made. He wore a steel watch chain and from this chain there hung a silver Geneva watch. Fool the prince might be, still, the general's servant felt that it was not correct for him to continue to converse thus with a visitor, in spite of the fact that the prince pleased him somehow.</p> 
<p>"And what time of day does the lady receive?" the latter asked, reseating himself in his old place.</p> 
<p>"Oh, that's not in my province! I believe she receives at any time; it depends upon the visitors. The dressmaker goes in at eleven. Gavrila Ardalionovitch is allowed much earlier than other people, too; he is even admitted to early lunch now and then."</p> 
<p>"It is much warmer in the rooms here than it is abroad at this season," observed the prince; " but it is much warmer there out of doors. As for the houses--a Russian can't live in them in the winter until he gets accustomed to them."</p> 
<p>"Don't they heat them at all?"</p> 
<p>"Well, they do heat them a little; but the houses and stoves are so different to ours."</p> 
<p>"H'm! were you long away?"</p> 
<p>"Four years! and I was in the same place nearly all the time,--in one village."</p> 
<p>"You must have forgotten Russia, hadn't you?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, indeed I had--a good deal; and, would you believe it, I often wonder at myself for not having forgotten how to speak Russian? Even now, as I talk to you, I keep saying to myself 'how well I am speaking it.' Perhaps that is partly why I am so talkative this morning. I assure you, ever since yesterday evening I have had the strongest desire to go on and on talking Russian."</p> 
<p>"H'm! yes; did you live in Petersburg in former years?"</p> 
<p>This good flunkey, in spite of his conscientious scruples, really could not resist continuing such a very genteel and agreeable conversation.</p> 
<p>"In Petersburg? Oh no! hardly at all, and now they say so much is changed in the place that even those who did know it well are obliged to relearn what they knew. They talk a good deal about the new law courts, and changes there, don't they?"</p> 
<p>"H'm! yes, that's true enough. Well now, how is the law over there, do they administer it more justly than here?"</p> 
<p>"Oh, I don't know about that! I've heard much that is good about our legal administration, too. There is no capital punishment here for one thing."</p> 
<p>"Is there over there?"</p> 
<p>"Yes--I saw an execution in France--at Lyons. Schneider took me over with him to see it."</p> 
<p>"What, did they hang the fellow?"</p> 
<p>"No, they cut off people's heads in France."</p> 
<p>"What did the fellow do?--yell?"</p> 
<p>"Oh no--it's the work of an instant. They put a man inside a frame and a sort of broad knife falls by machinery -they call the thing a guillotine-it falls with fearful force and weight-the head springs off so quickly that you can't wink your eye in between. But all the preparations are so dreadful. When they announce the sentence, you know, and prepare the criminal and tie his hands, and cart him off to the scaffold--that's the fearful part of the business. The people all crowd round--even women- though they don't at all approve of women looking on."</p> 
<p>"No, it's not a thing for women."</p> 
<p>"Of course not--of course not!--bah! The criminal was a fine intelligent fearless man; Le Gros was his name; and I may tell you--believe it or not, as you like--that when that man stepped upon the scaffold he CRIED, he did indeed,--he was as white as a bit of paper. Isn't it a dreadful idea that he should have cried --cried! Whoever heard of a grown man crying from fear--not a child, but a man who never had cried before--a grown man of forty-five years. Imagine what must have been going on in that man's mind at such a moment; what dreadful convulsions his whole spirit must have endured; it is an outrage on the soul that's what it is. Because it is said 'thou shalt not kill,' is he to be killed because he murdered some one else? No, it is not right, it's an impossible theory. I assure you, I saw the sight a month ago and it's dancing before my eyes to this moment. I dream of it, often."</p> 
<p>The prince had grown animated as he spoke, and a tinge of colour suffused his pale face, though his way of talking was as quiet as ever. The servant followed his words with sympathetic interest. Clearly he was not at all anxious to bring the conversation to an end. Who knows? Perhaps he too was a man of imagination and with some capacity for thought.</p> 
<p>"Well, at all events it is a good thing that there's no pain when the poor fellow's head flies off," he remarked.</p> 
<p>"Do you know, though," cried the prince warmly, "you made that remark now, and everyone says the same thing, and the machine is designed with the purpose of avoiding pain, this guillotine I mean; but a thought came into my head then: what if it be a bad plan after all? You may laugh at my idea, perhaps--but I could not help its occurring to me all the same. Now with the rack and tortures and so on--you suffer terrible pain of course; but then your torture is bodily pain only (although no doubt you have plenty of that) until you die. But HERE I should imagine the most terrible part of the whole punishment is, not the bodily pain at all--but the certain knowledge that in an hour,--then in ten minutes, then in half a minute, then now--this very INSTANT--your soul must quit your body and that you will no longer be a man-- and that this is certain, CERTAIN! That's the point--the certainty of it. Just that instant when you place your head on the block and hear the iron grate over your head--then--that quarter of a second is the most awful of all.</p> 
<p>"This is not my own fantastical opinion--many people have thought the same; but I feel it so deeply that I'll tell you what I think. I believe that to execute a man for murder is to punish him immeasurably more dreadfully than is equivalent to his crime. A murder by sentence is far more dreadful than a murder committed by a criminal. The man who is attacked by robbers at night, in a dark wood, or anywhere, undoubtedly hopes and hopes that he may yet escape until the very moment of his death. There are plenty of instances of a man running away, or imploring for mercy--at all events hoping on in some degree--even after his throat was cut. But in the case of an execution, that last hope--having which it is so immeasurably less dreadful to die,--is taken away from the wretch and CERTAINTY substituted in its place! There is his sentence, and with it that terrible certainty that he cannot possibly escape death--which, I consider, must be the most dreadful anguish in the world. You may place a soldier before a cannon's mouth in battle, and fire upon him--and he will still hope. But read to that same soldier his death-sentence, and he will either go mad or burst into tears. Who dares to say that any man can suffer this without going mad? No, no! it is an abuse, a shame, it is unnecessary--why should such a thing exist? Doubtless there may be men who have been sentenced, who have suffered this mental anguish for a while and then have been reprieved; perhaps such men may have been able to relate their feelings afterwards. Our Lord Christ spoke of this anguish and dread. No! no! no! No man should be treated so, no man, no man!"</p> 
<p>The servant, though of course he could not have expressed all this as the prince did, still clearly entered into it and was greatly conciliated, as was evident from the increased amiability of his expression. "If you are really very anxious for a smoke," he remarked, "I think it might possibly be managed, if you are very quick about it. You see they might come out and inquire for you, and you wouldn't be on the spot. You see that door there? Go in there and you'll find a little room on the right; you can smoke there, only open the window, because I ought not to allow it really, and--." But there was no time, after all.</p> 
<p>A young fellow entered the ante-room at this moment, with a bundle of papers in his hand. The footman hastened to help him take off his overcoat. The new arrival glanced at the prince out of the corners of his eyes.</p> 
<p>"This gentleman declares, Gavrila Ardalionovitch," began the man, confidentially and almost familiarly, "that he is Prince Muishkin and a relative of Madame Epanchin's. He has just arrived from abroad, with nothing but a bundle by way of luggage--."</p> 
<p>The prince did not hear the rest, because at this point the servant continued his communication in a whisper.</p> 
<p>Gavrila Ardalionovitch listened attentively, and gazed at the prince with great curiosity. At last he motioned the man aside and stepped hurriedly towards the prince.</p> 
<p>"Are you Prince Muishkin?" he asked, with the greatest courtesy and amiability.</p> 
<p>He was a remarkably handsome young fellow of some twenty-eight summers, fair and of middle height; he wore a small beard, and his face was most intelligent. Yet his smile, in spite of its sweetness, was a little thin, if I may so call it, and showed his teeth too evenly; his gaze though decidedly good-humoured and ingenuous, was a trifle too inquisitive and intent to be altogether agreeable.</p> 
<p>"Probably when he is alone he looks quite different, and hardly smiles at all!" thought the prince.</p> 
<p>He explained about himself in a few words, very much the same as he had told the footman and Rogojin beforehand.</p> 
<p>Gavrila Ardalionovitch meanwhile seemed to be trying to recall something.</p> 
<p>"Was it not you, then, who sent a letter a year or less ago--from Switzerland, I think it was--to Elizabetha Prokofievna (Mrs. Epanchin)?"</p> 
<p>"It was."</p> 
<p>"Oh, then, of course they will remember who you are. You wish to see the general? I'll tell him at once--he will be free in a minute; but you--you had better wait in the ante-chamber,--hadn't you? Why is he here?" he added, severely, to the man.</p> 
<p>"I tell you, sir, he wished it himself!"</p> 
<p>At this moment the study door opened, and a military man, with a portfolio under his arm, came out talking loudly, and after bidding good-bye to someone inside, took his departure.</p> 
<p>"You there, Gania? cried a voice from the study, "come in here, will you?"</p> 
<p>Gavrila Ardalionovitch nodded to the prince and entered the room hastily.</p> 
<p>A couple of minutes later the door opened again and the affable voice of Gania cried:</p> 
<p>"Come in please, prince!"</p>  
<p>将军有一一个娇美似花的家庭。确实，这里已不尽都是盛开的玫瑰，可是也有许多地方早已开始引起将军阁下的认真和热切的关注，把主要的希望和目标都集中在那上面，生活中还有什么，还有什么目标比父母的目标更重要、更神圣呢？不把心贴着家庭，还贴着什么呢？将军的家庭由夫人和三位成年的女儿组成。很久以前，还是当中尉的时候，将军就结了婚，妻子年龄几乎跟他一样大，既不漂亮，也没有文化，他娶她只得到５０个农奴的陪嫁，确实，这也就成为他日后福运的基础。但是后来将军川来也不抱怨自己早结婚，从来也不把这看作是不够精明的青春年少时的钟情，他对自己的夫人相当尊敬，有时甚至很怕她，以致爱她。将军夫人是梅什金公爵家族的人，家族虽不显赫，但相当古老，夫人也因自己的出身自视甚高。当时的一个有影响人物、保护人之一（其实，这种保护丝毫无须费心）同意关照一下公爵小姐的婚姻，他为年轻的军官打开了篱笆，朝前推了他一把，而对于年轻的军官来说，即使不推，只要一瞥，就不会徒劳了。除不多几次例外，夫妇俩长期以来一直和谐相处。还在很年轻的时候；由于是公爵小姐出身，而且又是家族中最后一个，也可能是因为个人的品性，将军夫人就善于给自己找一些很高贵的夫人做保护人，后来鉴于自己丈夫的富有和重要的职位，她甚至在这个上层社交圈里也有点得心应手了。</p> 
<p>近几年中将军的三个女儿亚历山德拉，阿杰莱达，阿格拉娅长大了，成人了。确实，她们三人都只是叶潘钦家的人，但是母亲是公爵家族出身，陪嫁丰厚，父亲日后大概能谋得很高的地位，还有相当重要的是，三位小姐，容貌姣好，连最年长的亚历山德拉也不例外，她已过２５岁，中间那位是２３岁，最小的阿格拉娅刚满２０岁。这最小的甚至完全是个美人，在上流社会她已开始十分引人注目。但这还不是一切：三位小姐所受的教育、聪慧和才能都很出众。大家都知道，她们彼此特别亲爱，互相支持。曾经有人说，为了全家的宠儿——小妹，似乎两位姐姐甚至作出了某种牺牲。在社交界她们不仅不喜欢招摇，甚至过分温雅持重。谁也不会责备她们高慢和骄矜，可同时人们也知道，她们倔傲，知道自己的身价。大小姐搞音乐，二小姐是出色的画家，但多年来几乎谁也不知道这一点，只是最近才被人发现，还是偶然的。总之关于她们有非常多的溢美之词，但是也有对她们并无好感的人。他们怀着恐惧的口吻说，她们读了多少书”，她们并不急于出嫁，虽然珍视社会名流，但始终不十分追求，尤其引人注意的是，她们都知道父亲的志向、性格、目标和愿望。</p> 
<p>公爵按将军府宅门铃的时候，己将近１１点了，将军住在二楼，居所尽可能布置得简朴，但又与他的身份相称。穿仆役制服的仆人为公爵开了门，一开始就以怀疑目光瞥了一眼公爵和他的小包裹，因此公爵必须跟这个仆人作长久的解释，在公爵不止一次、明确地声明他确是梅什金公爵，有要事一定得见将军后，困惑的仆人才终于在旁边陪同他到小小的前厅，它就在接待室前、书房旁边，然后把他交给每天早晨在前厅当班，并向将军报告来访者的另一个人。这个人身穿燕尾服，４０开外的年纪，一副忧心忡忡的脸相，他是将军大人书房的专职仆从和通报者，因而知道自己的身价。</p> 
<p>“请在接待室等一下，小包裹请留在这里，”他说着，一边不急不忙和摆出一副架子地坐到扶手椅里，同时严峻而惊奇地望了一眼公爵，他这时就全在他旁边的椅子上，手里拿着自己的小包裹。</p> 
<p>“如果允许的话，”公爵说，“最好还是让我跟您在一起就在这里等，而在接待室里我一个人做什么呢？”</p> 
<p>“您不该呆在前厅，因为您是来访者，换句话说，是客人。您要见将军本人？”</p> 
<p>看来仆人对于放这样的来访者进去还不放心，便决定再问他一次。</p> 
<p>“是的，我有事……”公爵本已开始说。</p> 
<p>“我没有问您是什么事，我的事只是通报您来访，要是没有秘书、我对您说，我不会去报告您来访的。”</p> 
<p>这个人的怀疑心仿佛越来越大，因为公爵跟平日来访的客人太不般配了。虽然将军相当经常，几乎每天都在一定时刻接待客人，尤其是有事求见的客人，有时甚至是各种各样很不一样的客人，但是，尽管已很有经验，也有主人的规定，仆人还是十分疑惑，要报告必须通过秘书。</p> 
<p>“那么您确是……从国外来的？”他似乎身不由已地问道，可最终又发觉他说走了样，他大概是想问：“那么您确是梅什金公爵？”</p> 
<p>“是的，刚下火车。我觉得，您是想问：我是否真是梅什金公爵？只是出于礼貌才没有问。”</p> 
<p>“嗯……”仆人很惊讶，便含混地应着。</p> 
<p>“请相信，我没有对您说谎，您不用为我承担责任的。至于说我现在这副样子，还拿着小包，这没什么可奇怪的，目前我的境况不佳。”</p> 
<p>“噢，我担心的不是这个，您也知道，我的责任是报告，然后秘书会出来见您，除非您……问题就在于此，除非……如果可以的话，我斗胆想知道，您是否因为贫穷来求见将军的？”</p> 
<p>“哦，不是的，这一点您完全可以放心，我有别的事。”</p> 
<p>“您请原谅我，我是瞧您这副模样才这样问的，您等一下秘书，将军本人现在正与上校谈话，过后秘书会来的，秘书……是公司里的。”</p> 
<p>“这么说，既然要等很久，我想请问您：这里什么地方是否可以抽烟？我随身带有烟斗、烟草。”</p> 
<p>“抽……烟？”仆人以轻蔑和不解的目光朝他瞥了一眼，仿佛依然不相信自己的耳朵似的，“抽烟？不行，这里不能抽烟。再说您有这个念头应该感到羞愧。嘿……真奇怪！”</p> 
<p>“哦，我可不是要求在这个房间，这我是知道的。我是说，走出这里，到您指定的什么地方去抽，因为我已经习惯了，现在已有３个小时没有抽烟了。不过，随您的便，您知道，俗话说：人乡随俗……”</p> 
<p>“您这么一位我怎么报告。”仆人几乎是不由自主地咕哝说，“首先，您不应该呆在这里，而应坐在会客室里，因为您本人是来访者，换句话说是客人。我可是要负责的……您，怎么，难道打算住这里？”他又脱了一眼显然使他不放心的公爵的包裹，补问道。</p> 
<p>“不，我没有这个想法，甚至即使邀请我，我也不会留下来，我来只不文想认识一下，别无他求。”</p> 
<p>“怎么？认识一下？”仆人带着十分的怀疑惊讶地问，“那您起先怎么讲你有事情？”</p> 
<p>“噢，几乎不是为了事情！也就是说，如果您愿意的话，也是有一桩事情只是想来请教，但我主要地是来自我介绍，因为我是梅什金公爵，而叶潘钦将军夫人也是梅什金家族的最后一位公爵小姐。除了我和她，梅什金家族别无他人了。”</p> 
<p>“这么说，您还是亲戚喏？”几乎已经完全吓慌的仆人哆嗦了一下。</p> 
<p>“这几乎不算什么亲戚，不过，如果要硬拉，当然也是亲戚，但是关系非常远，以致现在已无法理清了。我在国外有一次曾经写信给将军夫人，但是没有给我回信，我仍然认为回国后有必要建立起关系。我现在对您做这一解释，是为了使您不再怀疑，因为我看到，您始终还是不放心。您去报告是梅什金公爵，报告本身就看得出我拜访的原因，接见——很好，不接见——也许也很好，只不过似乎不可能不接见：将军夫人当然想见，自己家族长辈的唯一代表，她很看重自己的家族出身，我确切地听人家这样议论她。”</p> 
<p>公爵的话似乎是最简单不过的了，可是他越简单，在此种场合下便变得越加不可思议，颇有经验的仆人不能不感觉到某种言谈举止，它对一般人来说完全是合乎礼节的，而在客人与仆人间就完全是不合乎常规了，因为仆人比他们的主人一般所想象的要聪明得多，于是仆人便想到，这里不外是两件事：要么公爵是个不屑一顾的疯子，一定是来告穷求援的；要么公爵是个傻瓜，没有自尊心，因为聪明、自尊的公爵是不会坐在前厅并跟仆人谈自己的事的。这么说来，不论是这种还是那种情况，是否得由他担责任呢？</p> 
<p>“您还是请去会客室吧，”他尽量坚决地说。</p> 
<p>“要是坐那里的活，就不会向您解释这一切了，”公爵快活地笑了起来，“这么说，您瞧着我的风衣和包裹，还是不放心。也许，现在您已没什么必要等秘书了，还是自己去报告吧。”</p> 
<p>“像您这样的来访者，没有秘书我是不能通报的。何况刚才大人还亲自吩咐，上校在的时候，无论谁来都不要骚扰他们，而加夫里拉·阿尔达利维奇无须禀报就可进去。”</p> 
<p>“是官员吗？”</p> 
<p>“加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇吗？不是，他在公司里供职，您哪怕把包裹放在这里也好。”</p> 
<p>“我早就想到了，只要您允许。还有，我可以把风衣也脱掉吗？”</p> 
<p>“当然，不能穿着风衣进去见他呀！”</p> 
<p>公爵站起身，急忙脱下风衣，只剩下已经穿旧但相当体面、缝制精巧的上衣，背心上挂着一条钢链，钢链上是一只日内瓦的银表。</p> 
<p>仆人已经认定，公爵是个傻瓜，但将军的仆人仍然觉得，毕竟继续与访者交谈是不合礼节的，尽管不知为什么他喜欢公爵，当然、仅就某一点来讲是这样，但是，从另一种观点来看，公爵又激起了他的断然的和不该有的愤感。</p> 
<p>“那么，将军夫人什么时候接见客人？”公爵又坐到原来的地方问。</p> 
<p>“这已经不是我的事了。接见没有规定，要看是什么人，女裁缝１１点钟也准许进去，加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁维奇也比别人早允准进去，甚至还允准进去吃早餐。”</p> 
<p>“你们这里冬天房间里要比国外暖和，”公爵说，“但是那里街上比我那儿暖和，而冬天屋子里……俄罗斯人因为不习惯是无法生活的。”</p> 
<p>“不生火吗？”</p> 
<p>“是的，房子结构也不一样，也就是炉子和窗户不一样。”</p> 
<p>“噢！您去了很久吗？”</p> 
<p>“有四年，不过，我几乎老在一个地方呆着，在农村。”</p> 
<p>“不习惯我们的生活了，是吗？”</p> 
<p>“这倒是真的，相信不，我对自己也感到奇怪，没有忘记怎么说俄语，现在跟您在说话，而自己却在想：‘我可说得挺好。”也许，因此我才说这么多话。真的，从昨天起就老是想说俄语。”</p> 
<p>“嗯！嘿！从前在彼得堡住过吗？”（不论仆人怎么克制自己，却不可能不维系这样彬彬有礼的客气的谈话）。</p> 
<p>“彼得堡？几乎根本没有住过，只是路过，过去一点也不了解这儿的情；现在听说了许多新鲜事，据说，即使是原来了解彼得堡的人，也得重新了解，现在这里谈审理案件谈得很多。”</p> 
<p>“嗯！……审案子，审案倒确是审案。那里怎么样，是否更公正些？”</p> 
<p>“我不知道。关于我们的审案，我倒是听到许多好话，比如，我们现在又没有死刑了。”</p> 
<p>“那边判死刑吗？”</p> 
<p>“是的，我在法国看见过，是在里昂，是施奈德把我带到那儿去的。”</p> 
<p>“把人绞死？”</p> 
<p>“不，在法国一直是砍头。”</p> 
<p>“那么犯人叫喊吗？”</p> 
<p>“哪里会喊？一霎那的时间。那是用一种叫斩首机的机器来执行死刑的，把人往里一放，一把大刀就落下来了，又重又有力量……眼睛也来不及眨一下，头颅就掉下来了。准备工作是很沉重的。宣布判决，给犯人收拾停当，捆绑好，送上断头台，这才可怕呢！人们跑拢来，甚至还有妇女，虽然那里不喜欢妇女来看杀人。”</p> 
<p>“这不是她们的事。”</p> 
<p>“当然，当然！这是多么痛苦的事情！……有个罪犯人很聪明，胆子大，也强悍，有些年纪了，姓列格罗。我讲给您听，信不信由您。他一边走上断头台，一边哭着，脸色白得像张纸。难道能这样？难道不可怕吗？谁会因恐惧而哭泣？我甚至没有想到，一个不是孩子的人，而且从来也不哭的４５岁的汉子，竟会因恐惧而哭泣，此刻他的心里会发生什么情况，会使它发生怎样的痉挛？这只是对心灵的凌辱，而不是别的。《圣经》上说：‘不要杀人，’那么因为他杀了人，就要将他杀死吗？不，不能这样。我是一个月前看见这事的，可至今此景象尚浮现在眼前，梦见过五回。”</p> 
<p>公爵讲这些的时候，甚至激奋起来，淡淡的红晕漾起在他那苍白的脸上，尽管他说话仍像原来那样平和。仆人怀着同情和兴趣注视着他，似乎他不想离开他，也许，他也是一一个富于想象和试图思考的人。</p> 
<p>“好在掉脑袋那一会没有受很多痛苦，”他说。</p> 
<p>“您不知道吗，”公爵热烈地应声说，“您注意到这一点了，人家跟您一样，注意到的也正是这点，机器也是为此而想出来的：斩首机。我那时头脑里还冒出一个想法：也许这更不好，您会觉得这念头很怪，可是只要有点想象力，即便这样的念头也会冒出来的。您想想，比如，用刑，那就有皮肉痛苦，遍体鳞伤，这是肉体的折磨，因而也就能摆脱精神的痛苦，因为光这些伤痛就够折磨人的了，直至死去，而最主要的，最剧烈的痛苦，也许不是伤痛，而正是明明知道再过一小时，然后再过十分钟，然后再过半分钟，然后现在，马上——灵魂就会从躯体出窍，你便再也不是人了，这是确定无疑的，主要的正是确定无疑。而把头伸到屠刀底下）听见它将在头上面发出咋嚷一声，这四分之一秒是最可怕的。您知道，这不是我的瞎想，许多人都这样说过，我相信这点，因此我要直率地对您讲讲我的意见。因为杀人而处死人是比罪行本身重得多的惩罚，判处死刑比强盗杀人更要可怕得多。强盗害死的那个人，夜里在树林里被杀或者什么别的方式被害，直至最后那瞬间，一定还抱着有救的希望。有过一些例子，有的人喉咙已被割断了，还寄希望于或逃走或求饶。而被判死刑的人，所有这最后的一点希望（怀着希望死去要轻松十倍）也被确定无疑要死剥夺了，这是判决，全部可怕的痛苦也就在确定无疑、不可避免的这死亡上，世上没有比这更强烈的痛苦了。战斗中把一个士兵带来，让他对着大炮口，朝他开炮，他还一直怀着希望，但是对这个士兵宣读确定无疑的死刑判决，他则会发疯或者哭泣的，谁说人的天性能忍受这种折磨而不会发疯？为什么要有这种岂有此理、毫不需要、徒劳无益的侮辱呢？也可能有这样的人，对他宣读了死刑判决，让他受一番折磨，然后对他说：‘走吧，饶恕你了。’这个人也许能说说所受的折磨、基督也曾讲过这种折磨和这种恐惧。不，对人是不能这样的！”</p> 
<p>仆人虽然不能像公爵那样表达这一切，也未能明白这一切，但是他理解了主要的内容，这甚至从他那流露出怜悯神情的脸上就可以看得出了。“既然您这么想抽烟，”他低声说，“那么，好吧，可以抽，只不过要快点，因为将军要是突然问起来，您却不在就不好了。喏，就在楼梯下面，您看见了吧，有一扇门，走进门，右边是个小房间，那里可以抽烟，只不过请把通风小窗打开，因为这不合我们的规矩……”</p> 
<p>但公爵没有来得及去抽烟，一个年轻人手里拿着文件突然走进了前厅。仆人为他脱下了皮大衣，年轻人脱了一眼公爵。</p> 
<p>“加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁内奇，”仆人神秘而又几乎是亲昵地说，“这位据称是梅什金公爵，是夫人的亲戚，他坐火车从国外来，手上拿着包裹，一只……”</p> 
<p>接下去的话公爵没有听清楚，因为仆人开始低语着。加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇注意地听着，以极大的好奇心打量着公爵，最后不再听仆人说话，急匆匆走向公爵。</p> 
<p>“您是梅什金公爵？”他异常殷勤和客气地间。这是个很漂亮的年轻人，也是２８岁左右，身材匀称，头发淡黄、中等个子，拿破仑式的小胡子，有一张聪慧的，十分漂亮的脸蛋，只不过他的微笑尽管十分亲切，却显得过分乖巧，而目光呢，尽管非常快活和显见的坦诚，却又过分专注和探究。</p> 
<p>“他一个人的时候，想必不会这样看人，也许，永远也不会笑的，”公爵不知怎么的有这样的感觉。</p> 
<p>公爵很快地说明了他所能说明的一切，几乎也就是原先已经向仆人还有罗戈任说明过的那些话，加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇当时似乎想起了什么。</p> 
<p>“是否是您，”他问，“一年前或者还要近些时间寄来过一封信，好像是从瑞士寄来给叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜的。”</p> 
<p>“正是。”</p> 
<p>“那么这里是知道您并且肯定记得您的。您要见大人？我马上报告……他一会儿就空了；只不过您……暂时您先在客厅稍候……为什么让客人待在这里？”他严厉地对仆人说。</p> 
<p>“我说过了，他自己不想去……”</p> 
<p>这时书房门突然开了，一个军人手中拿着公文包，一边大声说着话，鞠着躬，一边从那里走出来。</p> 
<p>“你在这里吗，加尼亚？”有个声音从书房里喊着，“到这儿来一下！”</p> 
<p>加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇朝公爵点了一下头，匆匆走进了书房。</p> 
<p>过了两分钟，门又开了，响起了加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇清脆的亲切的声音：</p> 
<p>“公爵，请进！”</p>
