To judge from the sounds which penetrated to the drawing-room, a number of people had already come in, and the stampede continued. Several voices were talking and shouting at once; others were talking and shouting on the stairs outside; it was evidently a most extraordinary visit that was about to take place.</p> 
<p>Everyone exchanged startled glances. Gania rushed out towards the dining-room, but a number of men had already made their way in, and met him.</p> 
<p>"Ah! here he is, the Judas!" cried a voice which the prince recognized at once. "How d'ye do, Gania, you old blackguard?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, that's the man!" said another voice.</p> 
<p>There was no room for doubt in the prince's mind: one of the voices was Rogojin's, and the other Lebedeff's.</p> 
<p>Gania stood at the door like a block and looked on in silence, putting no obstacle in the way of their entrance, and ten or a dozen men marched in behind Parfen Rogojin. They were a decidedly mixed-looking collection, and some of them came in in their furs and caps. None of them were quite drunk, but all appeared to De considerably excited.</p> 
<p>They seemed to need each other's support, morally, before they dared come in; not one of them would have entered alone but with the rest each one was brave enough. Even Rogojin entered rather cautiously at the head of his troop; but he was evidently preoccupied. He appeared to be gloomy and morose, and had clearly come with some end in view. All the rest were merely chorus, brought in to support the chief character. Besides Lebedeff there was the dandy Zalesheff, who came in without his coat and hat, two or three others followed his example; the rest were more uncouth. They included a couple of young merchants, a man in a great-coat, a medical student, a little Pole, a small fat man who laughed continuously, and an enormously tall stout one who apparently put great faith in the strength of his fists. A couple of "ladies" of some sort put their heads in at the front door, but did not dare come any farther. Colia promptly banged the door in their faces and locked it.</p> 
<p>"Hallo, Gania, you blackguard! You didn't expect Rogojin, eh?" said the latter, entering the drawing-room, and stopping before Gania.</p> 
<p>But at this moment he saw, seated before him, Nastasia Philipovna. He had not dreamed of meeting her here, evidently, for her appearance produced a marvellous effect upon him. He grew pale, and his lips became actually blue.</p> 
<p>"I suppose it is true, then!" he muttered to himself, and his face took on an expression of despair. "So that's the end of it! Now you, sir, will you answer me or not?" he went on suddenly, gazing at Gania with ineffable malice. "Now then, you--"</p> 
<p>He panted, and could hardly speak for agitation. He advanced into the room mechanically; but perceiving Nina Alexandrovna and Varia he became more or less embarrassed, in spite of his excitement. His followers entered after him, and all paused a moment at sight of the ladies. Of course their modesty was not fated to be long- lived, but for a moment they were abashed. Once let them begin to shout, however, and nothing on earth should disconcert them.</p> 
<p>"What, you here too, prince?" said Rogojin, absently, but a little surprised all the same " Still in your gaiters, eh?" He sighed, and forgot the prince next moment, and his wild eyes wandered over to Nastasia again, as though attracted in that direction by some magnetic force.</p> 
<p>Nastasia looked at the new arrivals with great curiosity. Gania recollected himself at last.</p> 
<p>"Excuse me, sirs," he said, loudly, "but what does all this mean?" He glared at the advancing crowd generally, but addressed his remarks especially to their captain, Rogojin. "You are not in a stable, gentlemen, though you may think it--my mother and sister are present."</p> 
<p>"Yes, I see your mother and sister," muttered Rogojin, through his teeth; and Lebedeff seemed to feel himself called upon to second the statement.</p> 
<p>"At all events, I must request you to step into the salon," said Gania, his rage rising quite out of proportion to his words, "and then I shall inquire--"</p> 
<p>"What, he doesn't know me!" said Rogojin, showing his teeth disagreeably. "He doesn't recognize Rogojin!" He did not move an inch, however.</p> 
<p>"I have met you somewhere, I believe, but--"</p> 
<p>"Met me somewhere, pfu! Why, it's only three months since I lost two hundred roubles of my father's money to you, at cards. The old fellow died before he found out. Ptitsin knows all about it. Why, I've only to pull out a three-rouble note and show it to you, and you'd crawl on your hands and knees to the other end of the town for it; that's the sort of man you are. Why, I've come now, at this moment, to buy you up! Oh, you needn't think that because I wear these boots I have no money. I have lots of money, my beauty,--enough to buy up you and all yours together. So I shall, if I like to! I'll buy you up! I will!" he yelled, apparently growing more and more intoxicated and excited." Oh, Nastasia Philipovna! don't turn me out! Say one word, do! Are you going to marry this man, or not?"</p> 
<p>Rogojin asked his question like a lost soul appealing to some divinity, with the reckless daring of one appointed to die, who has nothing to lose.</p> 
<p>He awaited the reply in deadly anxiety.</p> 
<p>Nastasia Philipovna gazed at him with a haughty, ironical. expression of face; but when she glanced at Nina Alexandrovna and Varia, and from them to Gania, she changed her tone, all of a sudden.</p> 
<p>"Certainly not; what are you thinking of? What could have induced you to ask such a question?" she replied, quietly and seriously, and even, apparently, with some astonishment.</p> 
<p>"No? No?" shouted Rogojin, almost out of his mind with joy. "You are not going to, after all? And they told me--oh, Nastasia Philipovna--they said you had promised to marry him, HIM! As if you COULD do it!--him--pooh! I don't mind saying it to everyone-- I'd buy him off for a hundred roubles, any day pfu! Give him a thousand, or three if he likes, poor devil' and he'd cut and run the day before his wedding, and leave his bride to me! Wouldn't you, Gania, you blackguard? You'd take three thousand, wouldn't you? Here's the money! Look, I've come on purpose to pay you off and get your receipt, formally. I said I'd buy you up, and so I will."</p> 
<p>"Get out of this, you drunken beast!" cried Gania, who was red and white by turns.</p> 
<p>Rogojin's troop, who were only waiting for an excuse, set up a howl at this. Lebedeff stepped forward and whispered something in Parfen's ear.</p> 
<p>"You're right, clerk," said the latter, "you're right, tipsy spirit--you're right!--Nastasia Philipovna," he added, looking at her like some lunatic, harmless generally, but suddenly wound up to a pitch of audacity, "here are eighteen thousand roubles, and--and you shall have more--." Here he threw a packet of bank- notes tied up in white paper, on the table before her, not daring to say all he wished to say.</p> 
<p>"No-no-no!" muttered Lebedeff, clutching at his arm. He was clearly aghast at the largeness of the sum, and thought a far smaller amount should have been tried first.</p> 
<p>"No, you fool--you don't know whom you are dealing with--and it appears I am a fool, too!" said Parfen, trembling beneath the flashing glance of Nastasia. "Oh, curse it all! What a fool I was to listen to you!" he added, with profound melancholy.</p> 
<p>Nastasia Philipovna, observing his woe-begone expression, suddenly burst out laughing.</p> 
<p>"Eighteen thousand roubles, for me? Why, you declare yourself a fool at once," she said, with impudent familiarity, as she rose from the sofa and prepared to go. Gania watched the whole scene with a sinking of the heart.</p> 
<p>"Forty thousand, then--forty thousand roubles instead of eighteen! Ptitsin and another have promised to find me forty thousand roubles by seven o'clock tonight. Forty thousand roubles--paid down on the nail!"</p> 
<p>The scene was growing more and more disgraceful; but Nastasia Philipovna continued to laugh and did not go away. Nina Alexandrovna and Varia had both risen from their places and were waiting, in silent horror, to see what would happen. Varia's eyes were all ablaze with anger; but the scene had a different effect on Nina Alexandrovna. She paled and trembled, and looked more and more like fainting every moment.</p> 
<p>"Very well then, a HUNDRED thousand! a hundred thousand! paid this very day. Ptitsin! find it for me. A good share shall stick to your fingers--come!"</p> 
<p>"You are mad!" said Ptitsin, coming up quickly and seizing him by the hand. "You're drunk--the police will be sent for if you don't look out. Think where you are."</p> 
<p>"Yes, he's boasting like a drunkard," added Nastasia, as though with the sole intention of goading him.</p> 
<p>"I do NOT boast! You shall have a hundred thousand, this very day. Ptitsin, get the money, you gay usurer! Take what you like for it, but get it by the evening! I'll show that I'm in earnest!" cried Rogojin, working himself up into a frenzy of excitement.</p> 
<p>"Come, come; what's all this?" cried General Ivolgin, suddenly and angrily, coming close up to Rogojin. The unexpectedness of this sally on the part of the hitherto silent old man caused some laughter among the intruders.</p> 
<p>"Halloa! what's this now?" laughed Rogojin. "You come along with me, old fellow! You shall have as much to drink as you like."</p> 
<p>"Oh, it's too horrible!" cried poor Colia, sobbing with shame and annoyance.</p> 
<p>"Surely there must be someone among all of you here who will turn this shameless creature out of the room?" cried Varia, suddenly. She was shaking and trembling with rage.</p> 
<p>"That's me, I suppose. I'm the shameless creature!" cried Nastasia Philipovna, with amused indifference. "Dear me, and I came--like a fool, as I am--to invite them over to my house for the evening! Look how your sister treats me, Gavrila Ardalionovitch."</p> 
<p>For some moments Gania stood as if stunned or struck by lightning, after his sister's speech. But seeing that Nastasia Philipovna was really about to leave the room this time, he sprang at Varia and seized her by the arm like a madman.</p> 
<p>"What have you done?" he hissed, glaring at her as though he would like to annihilate her on the spot. He was quite beside himself, and could hardly articulate his words for rage.</p> 
<p>"What have I done? Where are you dragging me to?"</p> 
<p>"Do you wish me to beg pardon of this creature because she has come here to insult our mother and disgrace the whole household, you low, base wretch?" cried Varia, looking back at her brother with proud defiance.</p> 
<p>A few moments passed as they stood there face to face, Gania still holding her wrist tightly. Varia struggled once--twice--to get free; then could restrain herself no longer, and spat in his face.</p> 
<p>"There's a girl for you!" cried Nastasia Philipovna. "Mr. Ptitsin, I congratulate you on your choice."</p> 
<p>Gania lost his head. Forgetful of everything he aimed a blow at Varia, which would inevitably have laid her low, but suddenly another hand caught his. Between him and Varia stood the prince.</p> 
<p>"Enough--enough!" said the latter, with insistence, but all of a tremble with excitement.</p> 
<p>"Are you going to cross my path for ever, damn you!" cried Gania; and, loosening his hold on Varia, he slapped the prince's face with all his force.</p> 
<p>Exclamations of horror arose on all sides. The prince grew pale as death; he gazed into Gania's eyes with a strange, wild, reproachful look; his lips trembled and vainly endeavoured to form some words; then his mouth twisted into an incongruous smile.</p> 
<p>"Very well--never mind about me; but I shall not allow you to strike her!" he said, at last, quietly. Then, suddenly, he could bear it no longer, and covering his face with his hands, turned to the wall, and murmured in broken accents:</p> 
<p>"Oh! how ashamed you will be of this afterwards!"</p> 
<p>Gania certainly did look dreadfully abashed. Colia rushed up to comfort the prince, and after him crowded Varia, Rogojin and all, even the general.</p> 
<p>"It's nothing, it's nothing!" said the prince, and again he wore the smile which was so inconsistent with the circumstances.</p> 
<p>"Yes, he will be ashamed!" cried Rogojin. "You will be properly ashamed of yourself for having injured such a--such a sheep" (he could not find a better word). "Prince, my dear fellow, leave this and come away with me. I'll show you how Rogojin shows his affection for his friends."</p> 
<p>Nastasia Philipovna was also much impressed, both with Gania's action and with the prince's reply.</p> 
<p>Her usually thoughtful, pale face, which all this while had been so little in harmony with the jests and laughter which she had seemed to put on for the occasion, was now evidently agitated by new feelings, though she tried to conceal the fact and to look as though she were as ready as ever for jesting and irony.</p> 
<p>"I really think I must have seen him somewhere!" she murmured seriously enough.</p> 
<p>"Oh, aren't you ashamed of yourself--aren't you ashamed? Are you really the sort of woman you are trying to represent yourself to be? Is it possible?" The prince was now addressing Nastasia, in a tone of reproach, which evidently came from his very heart.</p> 
<p>Nastasia Philipovna looked surprised, and smiled, but evidently concealed something beneath her smile and with some confusion and a glance at Gania she left the room.</p> 
<p>However, she had not reached the outer hall when she turned round, walked quickly up to Nina Alexandrovna, seized her hand and lifted it to her lips.</p> 
<p>"He guessed quite right. I am not that sort of woman," she whispered hurriedly, flushing red all over. Then she turned again and left the room so quickly that no one could imagine what she had come back for. All they saw was that she said something to Nina Alexandrovna in a hurried whisper, and seemed to kiss her hand. Varia, however, both saw and heard all, and watched Nastasia out of the room with an expression of wonder.</p> 
<p>Gania recollected himself in time to rush after her in order to show her out, but she had gone. He followed her to the stairs.</p> 
<p>"Don't come with me," she cried, "Au revoir, till the evening--do you hear? Au revoir!"</p> 
<p>He returned thoughtful and confused; the riddle lay heavier than ever on his soul. He was troubled about the prince, too, and so bewildered that he did not even observe Rogojin's rowdy band crowd past him and step on his toes, at the door as they went out. They were all talking at once. Rogojin went ahead of the others, talking to Ptitsin, and apparently insisting vehemently upon something very important</p> 
<p>"You've lost the game, Gania" he cried, as he passed the latter.</p> 
<p>Gania gazed after him uneasily, but said nothing.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>前厅里一下子变得异常暄闹和人声嗜杂；从会客室里可以觉到，从外面走进了好几个人并且还在继续走进来。好几个声音在同时说话和叫喊；楼梯上也有人在说话和叫喊，听起来，从前厅上楼梯的门没有关上。看来是一次异常奇怪的突然来访：大家都互相交换着眼色；加尼亚奔向客厅，但客厅里已经进来了几个人。</p> 
<p>“啊，瞧他，这犹大！”公爵熟悉的一个声音喊了一声，“你好啊，加尼卡，下流痞！”</p> 
<p>“是他，正是他！”另一个声音随声附和着。</p> 
<p>公爵不用再怀疑了：一个声音是罗戈任，另一个则是列别杰夫。</p> 
<p>加尼亚似乎呆僵了一般站在会客室门口默默望着，没有去阻拦紧跟着帕尔芬·罗戈任一个接一个进入客厅的约摸１０个或１２个人。这一伙人三教九流，不仅仅形形色色，而且不成体统。有几个人进来时就像在街上一样，穿着大衣和皮氅。不过，倒也没有完全喝醉了的人，但是所有的人都带着强烈的醉意，大家好像都需要彼此的支持才走进来；无论哪个人都没有勇气单独进来，而是互相椎椎揉揉着进来。就连群首的罗戈任也是小心翼翼地走着，但是他心怀叵恻，自而显得阴沉、气恼而又优心忡仲。其余的人不过是附和着，或者最好是说，帮腔和助威。除了列别杰夫，这里还有个烫卷发的扎廖热夫，他在外问扔下自己的皮大毫，放肆不羁、神气活现地走了进来，还有两三个像他这样的先生，显然是商人。有一个穿着半似军用的大衣；有一个个子小小的但异常肥胖的人不停地笑着；有一个先生有两俄尺十二俄寸高的魁伟身躯，也非常肥胖，十分阴沉，默不作声，显然，强烈地指望用自己的拳头来解决问题。还有一个医科大学生；一个在人群中转来转去的波兰家伙。还有两位女士从楼梯上向过道里张望，却不敢走进去；科利亚就在她们鼻子跟前砰地关上了，并搭上钩子。</p> 
<p>“你好哇，加尼卡，真是个下流痞！怎么，没有料到帕尔芬·罗戈任来吧？”罗戈任走到会客室，停在门口，面对着加尼亚又重说了一遍。但在此刻他突然看清楚了，就在自己对面，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜在会客室里。显然，他头脑里根本没有想到会在这里遇见她，因为突然看见她使他产生了非同一般的印象；他的脸色变得惨白，连嘴唇都发育了。“看来，这是真的！”他轻轻地似乎对自己喃喃着，一副丧魂落魄的神态，“完了！……好吧……你现在就回答我！”他狂怒而又恶狼狠地望着加尼亚，突然咬牙切齿地说，“嘿！……”</p> 
<p>他甚至屏住了呼吸，连说话也很吃力。他机械地向会客室移步，但当他正要跨进门的时候，突然看见了尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜和瓦里娅，便停住了，尽管他万分激动，还是感到有点发窘。跟在他后面走来的是列别杰夫，他如影子一般寸步不离他并已经醉得很厉害了，接着是大学生，握着拳头的先生。向左右点头哈腰致意的扎廖热夫，最后挤进来的是矮胖子。女士们在场还多少使他们有些克制并且显然大大妨碍着他们，当然，这也不过维持到开场，维持到出现借口可以哄嚷和闹开场……那时任何女士都不会妨碍他们了。</p> 
<p>“怎么？公爵，您也在这里？”对遇见公爵多少感到惊奇的罗戈任漫不经心地说，“还穿着鞋罩，唉。”他叹了口气，即刻就忘记了公爵，又把目光移到纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜身上，像被磁铁吸引住一样，越来越移近、靠拢她。</p> 
<p>纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜也怀着一种不安和好奇的心情望着这些不速之客。</p> 
<p>加尼亚终于醒悟过来了。</p> 
<p>“但是，请问，这究竟是什么意思。”他严厉地扫视着进来的人，主要对着罗戈任大声说着，“你们进来的好像不是马厩，先生们，这里有我的母亲和妹妹……”</p> 
<p>“我们看见了母亲和妹妹，”罗戈任从牙缝里挤出含糊不清的话。</p> 
<p>“这看得出是母亲和妹妹，”列别杰夫为表示礼貌附和说。</p> 
<p>握着拳头的先生大概以为时机到了，便开始咕哝着什么。</p> 
<p>“可是，竟然是这样！”突然加尼亚似乎过分提高了嗓门，像一声爆炸似的，他说，“第一，请所有的人离开这里去客厅，然后请允许认识……”</p> 
<p>“瞧吧，他不认识，”罗戈任站在原地不动，凶狠地毗牙咧嘴说，“罗戈任也不认识？”</p> 
<p>“我就算是在哪儿遇见过您，但是……”</p> 
<p>“瞧吧，在哪儿遇见过！我把父亲的２００卢布输给你总共才不过３个月，老头子直至去世还不知道这件事；你把我拖了进去，而克尼夫做了手脚。走不出来了？普季岑可是个证人！只要我给你看３个卢布，现在就从口袋里扣出来，你就会四肢着地爬到瓦西利耶夫斯基岛上去拿的，你就是这样的人！你的灵魂就是这样的！我现在来就是要用钱把你整个儿买下来，你别瞧我穿着这样的靴子走进来，兄弟，我有许多钱，我要把你整个儿连同你的所有家当统统买下来……我想把你们所有的人都买下来！全部买！”罗戈任似乎醉得自来越厉害，暴躁地嚷着。“嗨”他喊了一声，“纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜！你别赶我走，您只要说一句话：您是不是就要跟他结婚了？”</p> 
<p>罗戈任像是个茫然不知所措的人，又像向某个神明似的提出自己的问题但是又带着已经没有什么可失去的被判死刑的囚犯那种胆大妄为。在死一样的苦恼中他期待着回答。</p> 
<p>纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫挪用嘲讽和高傲的目光打量着他，但是也瞥了一眼瓦里娅和尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜，扫了一眼加尼亚，突然改变了口气。</p> 
<p>“完全没有的事，您怎么啦？凭什么您忽然想起要问这个？”她平心静与和严肃认真地回答着，似乎还带几分惊讶。</p> 
<p>“没有？没有！！”罗戈任几乎高兴得发狂地嚷了起来，“这么说是没有的事喏？！可他们对我说……哎！算了！……纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜！他们说您跟加尼卡已经定亲了！是跟他吗？难道可以这样吗？（我现在就对他们大声讲）我用一百卢布就把他整个儿买下来，我要给他一千，好吧，三千，要么放弃，他在婚礼前夜就会逃走，把整个儿新娘留给我。加尼卡，不就是这样吗，下流痞！你可只要拿三千卢布！瞧这些钱，就在这里！我来就是要向你拿一张这样的收条；我说了：我要买 --要买！”</p> 
<p>“从这几走开，你醉了！”脸色红一块白一块的加尼亚喊道。</p> 
<p>紧跟着他的喊声突然响起了骤然迸发出来的几个嗓门的声音；罗戈任这一整帮人早就等着可以寻衅的第一个机会。列别杰夫极为卖力地在罗戈任多边嘀咕着什么。</p> 
<p>“对，当官儿的！”罗戈任回答说，“对，醉鬼！哎，就这样吧。纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜！”他喊了起来，一边如一个发疯的人一般望着她，一边畏缩着，却突然鼓起勇气到放肆的地步。“这是一万八千卢布！”他把用细绳子捆成十字形的一捆包着白纸的钞票扔到她面前的小桌上，“瞧！而且……还会有！”</p> 
<p>他没有敢把他想说的话说到底。</p> 
<p>“不……不……不！”列别杰夫露出一副惊吓得不得了的样子又对他低语说。可以猜得到，他是被这巨大的数额吓坏了，并建议从小得难以比拟的数字试起。</p> 
<p>“不、兄弟，这一点上你是个傻瓜，你不知道，你想到哪儿去了……是啊、看来，我跟你一起成了傻瓜！”罗戈任在纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜炯炯闪亮的目光下一下子恍然大悟并打了个颤。“嗨！我是瞎说，我听你的，”他深感后悔地补了一句。</p> 
<p>纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫历凝视了一会罗戈任那颓丧的脸，突然笑了起来。</p> 
<p>“一万八千，给我？瞧马上就显出乡巴佬的样子来了！”她突然以放肄无礼的腔调说，并从沙发上站起来，似乎打算离开，加尼亚屏住心跳观察着这一慕。</p> 
<p>“那么就四万，四万，而不是一万八千！”罗戈任喊了起来，“万卡·普季岑和比斯库普答应到七点钟提交四万的，四万！全都放桌上。”</p> 
<p>这一幕结果变得极不像话，但纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜依然笑着，并不离去，仿佛真的打算让这场戏拖延下去。尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜和瓦里娅也从自己座位上站起来，惊惧、无言地等待着，这件事会有什么结果；瓦里娅的眼睛闪闪发亮，但是所有这一切在尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜身上产生的反应是痛苦的；她颤栗着，好像马上就要昏倒。</p> 
<p>“既然这样，那就十万！今天我就送上十万！普季岑，救救急！这可是炙手难得的赚钱机会！”</p> 
<p>“你疯啦！”普季岑快步走近他，抓住他的手，突然低声说。“你醉了，人家要派人去叫警察了。你现在在什么地方？”</p> 
<p>“他是喝醉了说胡话，”纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜说，仿佛是要挑逗他。</p> 
<p>“我可不是胡说，会有这笔钱的！到晚上就有。普季岑，救救急吧，你是放高利贷的，随你想要多少，到晚上弄十万来吧；我要证明，我是不吝惜的！”罗戈任突然精神振奋到狂热的地步。</p> 
<p>“但是，这究竟是怎么回事？”气忿忿的阿尔达利翁·亚历山德罗维奇走近罗戈任突然威严地问。在此以前一直保持沉默的老头突然出来说话，给这一幕增添了许多滑稽可笑的因素。周围响起了笑声。</p> 
<p>“这又是从哪儿冒出来的？”罗戈任笑了起来，“走吧，老头，去喝个醉吧！”</p> 
<p>“这太卑鄙了！”科利亚喊道。他因为感到耻辱和恼恨完全哭了起来。</p> 
<p>“难道你们中间找不到一个人可以将这个恬不知耻的女人从这儿带走！”瓦里娅气得浑身哆嗦，突然喊了起来。</p> 
<p>“这是称我是恬不知耻的女人罗！”纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜以轻蔑的说话口气予以还击，“我可真是傻瓜，来这里叫他们去参加我那里的晚会！加夫里拉·阿尔达科翁诺维奇，瞧您的妹子多么鄙视我！”</p> 
<p>听到妹妹出言不逊，加尼亚像被闪电震惊似的站在那里好一会儿；但是在看到纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜这次真的要离开时，他怒冲冲地扑向瓦里娅，狂暴地抓住她的手。</p> 
<p>“你干了什么？”他逼视着她喊道，似乎想就在这个地方把她化为灰烬。他全然失去控制自己的能力，不加好好思量。</p> 
<p>“我干了什么了？你把我拖哪儿去？是不是要求得她的宽恕，就因为她玷辱了你的母亲并且来玷污你的家？你真是个卑贱的小人！”瓦里娅又大声嚷着并且以胜利者的姿态挑战地望着兄长。</p> 
<p>他们就这样面对面互相对峙着一会。加尼亚依然把她的手抓在自己手里，瓦里娅挣了一次，两次，用足了全部力气，但未能挣脱，突然；按捺不住气，朝兄长脸上啐了一口。</p> 
<p>“好一个姑娘家！”纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜喊道，“真棒，普季岑，我祝贺您！”</p> 
<p>加尼亚眼前一阵发晕，他完全忘乎所以，使出全身力气朝妹妹扇去。一下本来一定落在她的脸上。但突然有一只手挡住了加尼亚半空中挥过来的手。</p> 
<p>在他和妹妹之间站着公爵。</p> 
<p>“别闹了，够了！”他口气坚决地说，但是也在浑身发颤，这是因为精神上受到了强烈的震撼。</p> 
<p>“怎么，你永远要来挡我的道！”加尼亚甩开瓦里娅的手，吼了起来。一边在极度狂怒的状态下挥起空出来的那只手，狠狠地给了公爵一记耳光。</p> 
<p>“啊！”科利亚两手一拍惊呼着，“啊，我的天哪！”</p> 
<p>四面八方都发出了惊叹声。公爵脸色刷白。他用奇怪和责备的目光直视着加尼亚的眼睛；他的嘴唇哆嚏着，竭力要说什么；一种怪诞的并且完全不合时宜的微笑使嘴唇都歪扭了。</p> 
<p>“好吧，这一下就让我来挨……可是要打她……我无论如何不容许……”他终于轻轻说出话来；但突然克制不住，抛开加尼亚，双手掩面走到角落里，面对墙壁，用断断续续的声音说：</p> 
<p>“哦，您将为自己的行为感到多么羞耻！”</p> 
<p>加尼亚真的像是窘得不知所措地站在那里。科利亚扑过去拥抱和吻着公爵；跟在他后面罗戈任，瓦里姐，普季岑，尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜，所有的人，甚至连阿尔达利翁·亚历山德罗维奇都拥了过来。</p> 
<p>“没什么，没什么！”公爵对周围的人喃喃说着，依然带着那不合时宜的微笑。</p> 
<p>“他会后悔的！”罗戈任喊着，“你会羞愧的，加尼卡，竟然侮愿了公爵，这么一头绵羊（他找不到别的字眼）！公爵，你是我可爱的人，扔开他们；朝他们啐一口，我们走！你要知道，罗戈任多么爱你！”</p> 
<p>纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜既为加尼亚的行为也为公爵的回答感到十分震惊。她那通常是苍白和沉静的脸容与刚才似乎是故意发出来的笑声始终显得极不和谐，现在则因为心头充溢着一种新的感受而显然激动万分；但是，她似乎仍然不想流露出这种心态，仿佛竭力让那种嘲讽的神情留在脸上。</p> 
<p>“真的，我在什么地方见过他的脸！”她突然又想起了刚才自己提出的问题，一下子已经用很认真的口吻说了。</p> 
<p>“而您就不觉得害臊吗！难道您真是像现在这种样子的人？这是可能的吗？”公爵突然真诚地含着深深的责备大声说道。</p> 
<p>纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜感到惊讶，苦笑了一下，但是，在这苦笑中似乎藏着什么，她有点发窘，瞥了加尼亚一眼，就从会客室走下去。但是，还没有走到过道，她突然返回来，很快地走近尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜，拿起她的手，将它贴近自己的嘴唇。</p> 
<p>“我倒真的不是这样的人，他猜对了，”她一下子脸上飞起红晕，红着脸，尽快又热烈地低声说，然后转过身走出去，这次走得非常快，谁也都还没有弄清楚，她为什么回来。他们只看见她对尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜说了什么，还好像吻了她的手。但是瓦里娅看见了也听见了一切，惊讶地目送着她出去。</p> 
<p>加尼亚醒悟过来，奔去送纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜，但她已经走出去了。他在楼梯上赶上了她。</p> 
<p>“不用送！”她对他嚷着，“到晚上，再见！”</p> 
<p>他惶恐不安、若有所思地回来；难以解开的疑团压在他心间，比原先更为沉重。恍惚中可见公爵的身影……他忘神到这种地步，几乎没有看清，罗戈任这一大群人怎么从他身边蜂拥而过，甚至还把他挤在门口。坚随着罗戈任匆匆地离开屋子。所有的人都直着嗓门．粗声大气地谈论着什么。罗戈任本人和普季岑一起走着，坚决地反复说着什么要紧的，看来是刻不容缓的事。</p> 
<p>“你输了，加尼卡！”在经过他身边时，罗戈任喊了一声。</p> 
<p>加尼亚忐忑不安地望着他们的背影。</p>
