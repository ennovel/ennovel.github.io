<p>A row of orange and lemon trees and jasmines, planted in green tubs, stood on the fairly wide terrace. According to Lebedeff, these trees gave the house a most delightful aspect. Some were there when he bought it, and he was so charmed with the effect that he promptly added to their number. When the tubs containing these plants arrived at the villa and were set in their places, Lebedeff kept running into the street to enjoy the view of the house, and every time he did so the rent to be demanded from the future tenant went up with a bound.</p> 
<p>This country villa pleased the prince very much in his state of physical and mental exhaustion. On the day that they left for Pavlofsk, that is the day after his attack, he appeared almost well, though in reality he felt very far from it. The faces of those around him for the last three days had made a pleasant impression. He was pleased to see, not only Colia, who had become his inseparable companion, but Lebedeff himself and all the family, except the nephew, who had left the house. He was also glad to receive a visit from General Ivolgin, before leaving St. Petersburg.</p> 
<p>It was getting late when the party arrived at Pavlofsk, but several people called to see the prince, and assembled in the verandah. Gania was the first to arrive. He had grown so pale and thin that the prince could hardly recognize him. Then came Varia and Ptitsin, who were rusticating in the neighbourhood. As to General Ivolgin, he scarcely budged from Lebedeff's house, and seemed to have moved to Pavlofsk with him. Lebedeff did his best to keep Ardalion Alexandrovitch by him, and to prevent him from invading the prince's quarters. He chatted with him confidentially, so that they might have been taken for old friends. During those three days the prince had noticed that they frequently held long conversations; he often heard their voices raised in argument on deep and learned subjects, which evidently pleased Lebedeff. He seemed as if he could not do without the general. But it was not only Ardalion Alexandrovitch whom Lebedeff kept out of the prince's way. Since they had come to the villa, he treated his own family the same. Upon the pretext that his tenant needed quiet, he kept him almost in isolation, and Muishkin protested in vain against this excess of zeal. Lebedeff stamped his feet at his daughters and drove them away if they attempted to join the prince on the terrace; not even Vera was excepted.</p> 
<p>"They will lose all respect if they are allowed to be so free and easy; besides it is not proper for them," he declared at last, in answer to a direct question from the prince.</p> 
<p>"Why on earth not?" asked the latter. "Really, you know, you are making yourself a nuisance, by keeping guard over me like this. I get bored all by myself; I have told you so over and over again, and you get on my nerves more than ever by waving your hands and creeping in and out in the mysterious way you do."</p> 
<p>It was a fact that Lebedeff, though he was so anxious to keep everyone else from disturbing the patient, was continually in and out of the prince's room himself. He invariably began by opening the door a crack and peering in to see if the prince was there, or if he had escaped; then he would creep softly up to the arm- chair, sometimes making Muishkin jump by his sudden appearance. He always asked if the patient wanted anything, and when the latter replied that he only wanted to be left in peace, he would turn away obediently and make for the door on tip-toe, with deprecatory gestures to imply that he had only just looked in, that he would not speak a word, and would go away and not intrude again; which did not prevent him from reappearing in ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. Colia had free access to the prince, at which Lebedeff was quite disgusted and indignant. He would listen at the door for half an hour at a time while the two were talking. Colia found this out, and naturally told the prince of his discovery.</p> 
<p>"Do you think yourself my master, that you try to keep me under lock and key like this?" said the prince to Lebedeff. "In the country, at least, I intend to be free, and you may make up your mind that I mean to see whom I like, and go where I please."</p> 
<p>"Why, of course," replied the clerk, gesticulating with his hands.</p> 
<p>The prince looked him sternly up and down.</p> 
<p>"Well, Lukian Timofeyovitch, have you brought the little cupboard that you had at the head of your bed with you here?"</p> 
<p>"No, I left it where it was."</p> 
<p>"Impossible!"</p> 
<p>"It cannot be moved; you would have to pull the wall down, it is so firmly fixed."</p> 
<p>"Perhaps you have one like it here?"</p> 
<p>"I have one that is even better, much better; that is really why I bought this house."</p> 
<p>"Ah! What visitor did you turn away from my door, about an hour ago?"</p> 
<p>"The-the general. I would not let him in; there is no need for him to visit you, prince... I have the deepest esteem for him, he is a--a great man. You don't believe it? Well, you will see, and yet, most excellent prince, you had much better not receive him."</p> 
<p>"May I ask why? and also why you walk about on tiptoe and always seem as if you were going to whisper a secret in my ear whenever you come near me?"</p> 
<p>"I am vile, vile; I know it!" cried Lebedeff, beating his breast with a contrite air. "But will not the general be too hospitable for you?"</p> 
<p>"Too hospitable?"</p> 
<p>"Yes. First, he proposes to come and live in my house. Well and good; but he sticks at nothing; he immediately makes himself one of the family. We have talked over our respective relations several times, and discovered that we are connected by marriage. It seems also that you are a sort of nephew on his mother's side; he was explaining it to me again only yesterday. If you are his nephew, it follows that I must also be a relation of yours, most excellent prince. Never mind about that, it is only a foible; but just now he assured me that all his life, from the day he was made an ensign to the 11th of last June, he has entertained at least two hundred guests at his table every day. Finally, he went so far as to say that they never rose from the table; they dined, supped, and had tea, for fifteen hours at a stretch. This went on for thirty years without a break; there was barely time to change the table-cloth; directly one person left, another took his place. On feast-days he entertained as many as three hundred guests, and they numbered seven hundred on the thousandth anniversary of the foundation of the Russian Empire. It amounts to a passion with him; it makes one uneasy to hear of it. It is terrible to have to entertain people who do things on such a scale. That is why I wonder whether such a man is not too hospitable for you and me."</p> 
<p>"But you seem to be on the best of terms with him?"</p> 
<p>"Quite fraternal--I look upon it as a joke. Let us be brothers- in-law, it is all the same to me,--rather an honour than not. But in spite of the two hundred guests and the thousandth anniversary of the Russian Empire, I can see that he is a very remarkable man. I am quite sincere. You said just now that I always looked as if I was going to tell you a secret; you are right. I have a secret to tell you: a certain person has just let me know that she is very anxious for a secret interview with you."</p> 
<p>"Why should it be secret? Not at all; I will call on her myself tomorrow."</p> 
<p>"No, oh no!" cried Lebedeff, waving his arms; "if she is afraid, it is not for the reason you think. By the way, do you know that the monster comes every day to inquire after your health?"</p> 
<p>"You call him a monster so often that it makes me suspicious."</p> 
<p>"You must have no suspicions, none whatever," said Lebedeff quickly. "I only want you to know that the person in question is not afraid of him, but of something quite, quite different."</p> 
<p>"What on earth is she afraid of, then? Tell me plainly, without any more beating about the bush," said the prince, exasperated by the other's mysterious grimaces.</p> 
<p>"Ah that is the secret," said Lebedeff, with a smile.</p> 
<p>"Whose secret?"</p> 
<p>"Yours. You forbade me yourself to mention it before you, most excellent prince," murmured Lebedeff. Then, satisfied that he had worked up Muishkin's curiosity to the highest pitch, he added abruptly: "She is afraid of Aglaya Ivanovna."</p> 
<p>The prince frowned for a moment in silence, and then said suddenly:</p> 
<p>"Really, Lebedeff, I must leave your house. Where are Gavrila Ardalionovitch and the Ptitsins? Are they here? Have you chased them away, too?"</p> 
<p>"They are coming, they are coming; and the general as well. I will open all the doors; I will call all my daughters, all of them, this very minute," said Lebedeff in a low voice, thoroughly frightened, and waving his hands as he ran from door to door.</p> 
<p>At that moment Colia appeared on the terrace; he announced that Lizabetha Prokofievna and her three daughters were close behind him.</p> 
<p>Moved by this news, Lebedeff hurried up to the prince.</p> 
<p>"Shall I call the Ptitsins, and Gavrila Ardalionovitch? Shall I let the general in?" he asked.</p> 
<p>"Why not? Let in anyone who wants to see me. I assure you, Lebedeff, you have misunderstood my position from the very first; you have been wrong all along. I have not the slightest reason to hide myself from anyone," replied the prince gaily.</p> 
<p>Seeing him laugh, Lebedeff thought fit to laugh also, and though much agitated his satisfaction was quite visible.</p> 
<p>Colia was right; the Epanchin ladies were only a few steps behind him. As they approached the terrace other visitors appeared from Lebedeff's side of the house-the Ptitsins, Gania, and Ardalion Alexandrovitch.</p> 
<p>The Epanchins had only just heard of the prince's illness and of his presence in Pavlofsk, from Colia; and up to this time had been in a state of considerable bewilderment about him. The general brought the prince's card down from town, and Mrs. Epanchin had felt convinced that he himself would follow his card at once; she was much excited.</p> 
<p>In vain the girls assured her that a man who had not written for six months would not be in such a dreadful hurry, and that probably he had enough to do in town without needing to bustle down to Pavlofsk to see them. Their mother was quite angry at the very idea of such a thing, and announced her absolute conviction that he would turn up the next day at latest.</p> 
<p>So next day the prince was expected all the morning, and at dinner, tea, and supper; and when he did not appear in the evening, Mrs. Epanchin quarrelled with everyone in the house, finding plenty of pretexts without so much as mentioning the prince's name.</p> 
<p>On the third day there was no talk of him at all, until Aglaya remarked at dinner: "Mamma is cross because the prince hasn't turned up," to which the general replied that it was not his fault.</p> 
<p>Mrs. Epanchin misunderstood the observation, and rising from her place she left the room in majestic wrath. In the evening, however, Colia came with the story of the prince's adventures, so far as he knew them. Mrs. Epanchin was triumphant; although Colia had to listen to a long lecture. "He idles about here the whole day long, one can't get rid of him; and then when he is wanted he does not come. He might have sent a line if he did not wish to inconvenience himself."</p> 
<p>At the words "one can't get rid of him," Colia was very angry, and nearly flew into a rage; but he resolved to be quiet for the time and show his resentment later. If the words had been less offensive he might have forgiven them, so pleased was he to see Lizabetha Prokofievna worried and anxious about the prince's illness.</p> 
<p>She would have insisted on sending to Petersburg at once, for a certain great medical celebrity; but her daughters dissuaded her, though they were not willing to stay behind when she at once prepared to go and visit the invalid. Aglaya, however, suggested that it was a little unceremonious to go en masse to see him.</p> 
<p>"Very well then, stay at home," said Mrs. Epanchin, and a good thing too, for Evgenie Pavlovitch is coming down and there will be no one at home to receive him."</p> 
<p>Of course, after this, Aglaya went with the rest. In fact, she had never had the slightest intention of doing otherwise.</p> 
<p>Prince S., who was in the house, was requested to escort the ladies. He had been much interested when he first heard of the prince from the Epanchins. It appeared that they had known one another before, and had spent some time together in a little provincial town three months ago. Prince S. had greatly taken to him, and was delighted with the opportunity of meeting him again,</p> 
<p>The general had not come down from town as yet, nor had Evgenie Pavlovitch arrived.</p> 
<p>It was not more than two or three hundred yards from the Epanchins' house to Lebedeff's. The first disagreeable impression experienced by Mrs. Epanchin was to find the prince surrounded by a whole assembly of other guests--not to mention the fact that some of those present were particularly detestable in her eyes. The next annoying circumstance was when an apparently strong and healthy young fellow, well dressed, and smiling, came forward to meet her on the terrace, instead of the half-dying unfortunate whom she had expected to see.</p> 
<p>She was astonished and vexed, and her disappointment pleased Colia immensely. Of course he could have undeceived her before she started, but the mischievous boy had been careful not to do that, foreseeing the probably laughable disgust that she would experience when she found her dear friend, the prince, in good health. Colia was indelicate enough to voice the delight he felt at his success in managing to annoy Lizabetha Prokofievna, with whom, in spite of their really amicable relations, he was constantly sparring.</p> 
<p>"Just wait a while, my boy!" said she; "don't be too certain of your triumph." And she sat down heavily, in the arm-chair pushed forward by the prince.</p> 
<p>Lebedeff, Ptitsin, and General Ivolgin hastened to find chairs for the young ladies. Varia greeted them joyfully, and they exchanged confidences in ecstatic whispers.</p> 
<p>"I must admit, prince, I was a little put out to see you up and about like this--I expected to find you in bed; but I give you my word, I was only annoyed for an instant, before I collected my thoughts properly. I am always wiser on second thoughts, and I dare say you are the same. I assure you I am as glad to see you well as though you were my own son,--yes, and more; and if you don't believe me the more shame to you, and it's not my fault. But that spiteful boy delights in playing all sorts of tricks. You are his patron, it seems. Well, I warn you that one fine morning I shall deprive myself of the pleasure of his further acquaintance."</p> 
<p>"What have I done wrong now?" cried Colia. "What was the good of telling you that the prince was nearly well again? You would not have believed me; it was so much more interesting to picture him on his death-bed."</p> 
<p>"How long do you remain here, prince?" asked Madame Epanchin.</p> 
<p>"All the summer, and perhaps longer."</p> 
<p>"You are alone, aren't you,--not married?"</p> 
<p>"No, I'm not married!" replied the prince, smiling at the ingenuousness of this little feeler.</p> 
<p>"Oh, you needn't laugh! These things do happen, you know! Now then--why didn't you come to us? We have a wing quite empty. But just as you like, of course. Do you lease it from HIM?--this fellow, I mean," she added, nodding towards Lebedeff. "And why does he always wriggle so?"</p> 
<p>At that moment Vera, carrying the baby in her arms as usual, came out of the house, on to the terrace. Lebedeff kept fidgeting among the chairs, and did not seem to know what to do with himself, though he had no intention of going away. He no sooner caught sight of his daughter, than he rushed in her direction, waving his arms to keep her away; he even forgot himself so far as to stamp his foot.</p> 
<p>"Is he mad?" asked Madame Epanchin suddenly.</p> 
<p>"No, he ..."</p> 
<p>"Perhaps he is drunk? Your company is rather peculiar," she added, with a glance at the other guests....</p> 
<p>"But what a pretty girl! Who is she?"</p> 
<p>"That is Lebedeff's daughter--Vera Lukianovna."</p> 
<p>"Indeed? She looks very sweet. I should like to make her acquaintance."</p> 
<p>The words were hardly out of her mouth, when Lebedeff dragged Vera forward, in order to present her.</p> 
<p>"Orphans, poor orphans!" he began in a pathetic voice.</p> 
<p>"The child she carries is an orphan, too. She is Vera's sister, my daughter Luboff. The day this babe was born, six weeks ago, my wife died, by the will of God Almighty. ... Yes... Vera takes her mother's place, though she is but her sister... nothing more ... nothing more..."</p> 
<p>"And you! You are nothing more than a fool, if you'll excuse me! Well! well! you know that yourself, I expect," said the lady indignantly.</p> 
<p>Lebedeff bowed low. "It is the truth," he replied, with extreme respect.</p> 
<p>"Oh, Mr. Lebedeff, I am told you lecture on the Apocalypse. Is it true?" asked Aglaya.</p> 
<p>"Yes, that is so ... for the last fifteen years."</p> 
<p>"I have heard of you, and I think read of you in the newspapers."</p> 
<p>"No, that was another commentator, whom the papers named. He is dead, however, and I have taken his place," said the other, much delighted.</p> 
<p>"We are neighbours, so will you be so kind as to come over one day and explain the Apocalypse to me?" said Aglaya. "I do not understand it in the least."</p> 
<p>"Allow me to warn you," interposed General Ivolgin, that he is the greatest charlatan on earth." He had taken the chair next to the girl, and was impatient to begin talking. "No doubt there are pleasures and amusements peculiar to the country," he continued, "and to listen to a pretended student holding forth on the book of the Revelations may be as good as any other. It may even be original. But ... you seem to be looking at me with some surprise--may I introduce myself--General Ivolgin--I carried you in my arms as a baby--"</p> 
<p>"Delighted, I'm sure," said Aglaya; "I am acquainted with Varvara Ardalionovna and Nina Alexandrovna." She was trying hard to restrain herself from laughing.</p> 
<p>Mrs. Epanchin flushed up; some accumulation of spleen in her suddenly needed an outlet. She could not bear this General Ivolgin whom she had once known, long ago--in society.</p> 
<p>"You are deviating from the truth, sir, as usual!" she remarked, boiling over with indignation; "you never carried her in your life!"</p> 
<p>"You have forgotten, mother," said Aglaya, suddenly. "He really did carry me about,--in Tver, you know. I was six years old, I remember. He made me a bow and arrow, and I shot a pigeon. Don't you remember shooting a pigeon, you and I, one day?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, and he made me a cardboard helmet, and a little wooden sword--I remember!" said Adelaida.</p> 
<p>"Yes, I remember too!" said Alexandra. "You quarrelled about the wounded pigeon, and Adelaida was put in the corner, and stood there with her helmet and sword and all."</p>  
<p>"Yes, and look what you have come to now!" interrupted Mrs. Epanchin. "However, I see you have not quite drunk your better feelings away. But you've broken your wife's heart, sir--and instead of looking after your children, you have spent your time in public-houses and debtors' prisons! Go away, my friend, stand in some corner and weep, and bemoan your fallen dignity, and perhaps God will forgive you yet! Go, go! I'm serious! There's nothing so favourable for repentance as to think of the past with feelings of remorse!"</p> 
<p>There was no need to repeat that she was serious. The general, like all drunkards, was extremely emotional and easily touched by recollections of his better days. He rose and walked quietly to the door, so meekly that Mrs. Epanchin was instantly sorry for him.</p> 
<p>"Ardalion Alexandrovitch," she cried after him, "wait a moment, we are all sinners! When you feel that your conscience reproaches you a little less, come over to me and we'll have a talk about the past! I dare say I am fifty times more of a sinner than you are! And now go, go, good-bye, you had better not stay here!" she added, in alarm, as he turned as though to come back.</p> 
<p>"Don't go after him just now, Colia, or he'll be vexed, and the benefit of this moment will be lost!" said the prince, as the boy was hurrying out of the room.</p> 
<p>"Quite true! Much better to go in half an hour or so said Mrs. Epanchin.</p> 
<p>"That's what comes of telling the truth for once in one's life!" said Lebedeff. "It reduced him to tears."</p> 
<p>"Come, come! the less YOU say about it the better--to judge from all I have heard about you!" replied Mrs. Epanchin.</p> 
<p>The prince took the first opportunity of informing the Epanchin ladies that he had intended to pay them a visit that day, if they had not themselves come this afternoon, and Lizabetha Prokofievna replied that she hoped he would still do so.</p> 
<p>By this time some of the visitors had disappeared.</p> 
<p>Ptitsin had tactfully retreated to Lebedeff's wing; and Gania soon followed him.</p> 
<p>The latter had behaved modestly, but with dignity, on this occasion of his first meeting with the Epanchins since the rupture. Twice Mrs. Epanchin had deliberately examined him from head to foot; but he had stood fire without flinching. He was certainly much changed, as anyone could see who had not met him for some time; and this fact seemed to afford Aglaya a good deal of satisfaction.</p> 
<p>"That was Gavrila Ardalionovitch, who just went out, wasn't it?" she asked suddenly, interrupting somebody else's conversation to make the remark.</p> 
<p>"Yes, it was," said the prince.</p> 
<p>"I hardly knew him; he is much changed, and for the better!"</p> 
<p>"I am very glad," said the prince.</p> 
<p>"He has been very ill," added Varia.</p> 
<p>"How has he changed for the better?" asked Mrs. Epanchin. "I don't see any change for the better! What's better in him? Where did you get THAT idea from? WHAT'S better?"</p> 
<p>"There's nothing better than the 'poor knight'!" said Colia, who was standing near the last speaker's chair.</p> 
<p>"I quite agree with you there!" said Prince S., laughing.</p> 
<p>"So do I," said Adelaida, solemnly.</p> 
<p>"WHAT poor knight?" asked Mrs. Epanchin, looking round at the face of each of the speakers in turn. Seeing, however, that Aglaya was blushing, she added, angrily:</p> 
<p>"What nonsense you are all talking! What do you mean by poor knight?"</p> 
<p>"It's not the first time this urchin, your favourite, has shown his impudence by twisting other people's words," said Aglaya, haughtily.</p> 
<p>Every time that Aglaya showed temper (and this was very often), there was so much childish pouting, such "school-girlishness," as it were, in her apparent wrath, that it was impossible to avoid smiling at her, to her own unutterable indignation. On these occasions she would say, "How can they, how DARE they laugh at me?"</p> 
<p>This time everyone laughed at her, her sisters, Prince S., Prince Muishkin (though he himself had flushed for some reason), and Colia. Aglaya was dreadfully indignant, and looked twice as pretty in her wrath.</p> 
<p>"He's always twisting round what one says," she cried.</p> 
<p>"I am only repeating your own exclamation!" said Colia. "A month ago you were turning over the pages of your Don Quixote, and suddenly called out 'there is nothing better than the poor knight.' I don't know whom you were referring to, of course, whether to Don Quixote, or Evgenie Pavlovitch, or someone else, but you certainly said these words, and afterwards there was a long conversation . . . "</p> 
<p>"You are inclined to go a little too far, my good boy, with your guesses," said Mrs. Epanchin, with some show of annoyance.</p> 
<p>"But it's not I alone," cried Colia. "They all talked about it, and they do still. Why, just now Prince S. and Adelaida Ivanovna declared that they upheld 'the poor knight'; so evidently there does exist a 'poor knight'; and if it were not for Adelaida Ivanovna, we should have known long ago who the 'poor knight' was."</p> 
<p>"Why, how am I to blame?" asked Adelaida, smiling.</p> 
<p>"You wouldn't draw his portrait for us, that's why you are to blame! Aglaya Ivanovna asked you to draw his portrait, and gave you the whole subject of the picture. She invented it herself; and you wouldn't."</p> 
<p>"What was I to draw? According to the lines she quoted:</p> 
<p>"'From his face he never lifted That eternal mask of steel.'"</p> 
<p>"What sort of a face was I to draw? I couldn't draw a mask."</p> 
<p>"I don't know what you are driving at; what mask do you mean?" said Mrs. Epanchin, irritably. She began to see pretty clearly though what it meant, and whom they referred to by the generally accepted title of "poor knight." But what specially annoyed her was that the prince was looking so uncomfortable, and blushing like a ten-year-old child.</p> 
<p>"Well, have you finished your silly joke?" she added, and am I to be told what this 'poor knight' means, or is it a solemn secret which cannot be approached lightly?"</p> 
<p>But they all laughed on.</p> 
<p>"It's simply that there is a Russian poem," began Prince S., evidently anxious to change the conversation, "a strange thing, without beginning or end, and all about a 'poor knight.' A month or so ago, we were all talking and laughing, and looking up a subject for one of Adelaida's pictures--you know it is the principal business of this family to find subjects for Adelaida's pictures. Well, we happened upon this 'poor knight.' I don't remember who thought of it first--"</p> 
<p>"Oh! Aglaya Ivanovna did," said Colia.</p> 
<p>"Very likely--I don't recollect," continued Prince S.</p> 
<p>"Some of us laughed at the subject; some liked it; but she declared that, in order to make a picture of the gentleman, she must first see his face. We then began to think over all our friends' faces to see if any of them would do, and none suited us, and so the matter stood; that's all. I don't know why Nicolai Ardalionovitch has brought up the joke now. What was appropriate and funny then, has quite lost all interest by this time."</p> 
<p>"Probably there's some new silliness about it," said Mrs. Epanchin, sarcastically.</p> 
<p>"There is no silliness about it at all--only the profoundest respect," said Aglaya, very seriously. She had quite recovered her temper; in fact, from certain signs, it was fair to conclude that she was delighted to see this joke going so far; and a careful observer might have remarked that her satisfaction dated from the moment when the fact of the prince's confusion became apparent to all.</p> 
<p>"'Profoundest respect!' What nonsense! First, insane giggling, and then, all of a sudden, a display of 'profoundest respect.' Why respect? Tell me at once, why have you suddenly developed this 'profound respect,' eh?"</p> 
<p>"Because," replied Aglaya gravely, "in the poem the knight is described as a man capable of living up to an ideal all his life. That sort of thing is not to be found every day among the men of our times. In the poem it is not stated exactly what the ideal was, but it was evidently some vision, some revelation of pure Beauty, and the knight wore round his neck, instead of a scarf, a rosary. A device--A. N. B.--the meaning of which is not explained, was inscribed on his shield--"</p> 
<p>"No, A. N. D.," corrected Colia.</p> 
<p>"I say A. N. B., and so it shall be!" cried Aglaya, irritably. "Anyway, the 'poor knight' did not care what his lady was, or what she did. He had chosen his ideal, and he was bound to serve her, and break lances for her, and acknowledge her as the ideal of pure Beauty, whatever she might say or do afterwards. If she had taken to stealing, he would have championed her just the same. I think the poet desired to embody in this one picture the whole spirit of medieval chivalry and the platonic love of a pure and high-souled knight. Of course it's all an ideal, and in the 'poor knight' that spirit reached the utmost limit of asceticism. He is a Don Quixote, only serious and not comical. I used not to understand him, and laughed at him, but now I love the 'poor knight,' and respect his actions."</p> 
<p>So ended Aglaya; and, to look at her, it was difficult, indeed, to judge whether she was joking or in earnest.</p> 
<p>"Pooh! he was a fool, and his actions were the actions of a fool," said Mrs. Epanchin; "and as for you, young woman, you ought to know better. At all events, you are not to talk like that again. What poem is it? Recite it! I want to hear this poem! I have hated poetry all my life. Prince, you must excuse this nonsense. We neither of us like this sort of thing! Be patient!"</p> 
<p>They certainly were put out, both of them.</p> 
<p>The prince tried to say something, but he was too confused, and could not get his words out. Aglaya, who had taken such liberties in her little speech, was the only person present, perhaps, who was not in the least embarrassed. She seemed, in fact, quite pleased.</p> 
<p>She now rose solemnly from her seat, walked to the centre of the terrace, and stood in front of the prince's chair. All looked on with some surprise, and Prince S. and her sisters with feelings of decided alarm, to see what new frolic she was up to; it had gone quite far enough already, they thought. But Aglaya evidently thoroughly enjoyed the affectation and ceremony with which she was introducing her recitation of the poem.</p> 
<p>Mrs. Epanchin was just wondering whether she would not forbid the performance after all, when, at the very moment that Aglaya commenced her declamation, two new guests, both talking loudly, entered from the street. The new arrivals were General Epanchin and a young man.</p> 
<p>Their entrance caused some slight commotion.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>列别杰夫的别墅并不大，但是舒适，甚至漂亮。用作出租的那一部分特别作了装饰。在相当宽敞的露台上，就在从外面走进房间的地方，放着好些个绿色大木桶，里面栽着香橙、柠檬、茉莉树，按照列别杰夫的设想，这应构成最具魅力的景观。有些树是连同别墅一起买下的，它们摆在露台上所产生的效果使列别杰夫甚为赞赏，因而，当凑巧在拍卖市场也有这些栽在木梧里的树时，他就下决心买下来与原有的配套。当终于将所有的树都运到别墅和布置好的那一天，列别杰夫好几次下露台台阶跑到街上，然后从街上欣赏自己的房产，每一次他都在思想里增加着准备向未来租住别墅的房客索要的房租。虚弱无力、内心苦闷，身体受伤的公爵很喜欢别墅。其实，在搬到帕夫洛夫斯克的那一天，也就是他的病发作后的第三天，从外表来看，公爵已经和健康人的样子差不多了，虽然内心里仍觉得自己还没有康复。他对这三天里在自己身边见到的所有的人都感到高兴，他喜欢寸步不离他的科利亚，喜欢列别杰夫一家人（他的外甥不在，不知到哪儿去了），他也喜欢列别杰夫本人；甚至还高兴地接待了还在城里时就拜访过他的伊沃尔京将军。在搬来的那一天，已经近傍晚了，在他周围许多客人聚集在露台上：第一个来的是加尼亚，公爵几乎认不出他了--这段时间里他变得很厉害，人也瘦了许多。接着是瓦里娅和普季岑，他们也住在帕夫洛夫斯克住别墅。伊沃尔京将军几乎常住在列别杰夫家里，甚至好像是跟他一起搬过来的。列别杰夫竭力不让他到公爵那儿去，让他呆在自己屋里；他像好朋友一样对待将军，看来他们早就已经熟识了。公爵发现，这三天里他们有时候彼此进行了长谈，常常大声嚷嚷着，甚至好像是为一些学术问题而争论不休，而这却似乎使列别杰夫感到满足、可以想到，他甚至需要将军这个人，但是从一搬到别墅起他就对全家采取了像对公爵那样的防范措施：他借口不要打扰公爵，不放任何人到公爵那儿去，他对自己的女儿们，也包括抱着婴儿的维拉，只要一有怀疑他们要走到公爵所在的露台上去，便对她们又是跺脚，又去追奔，又是驱赶。尽管公爵一再请求不要赶走任何人。</p> 
<p>“第一，如果这样放纵她，就一点也没有恭敬的态度了；第二，对她们来说甚至也有失体统……”对于公爵直截了当的洁间，他终于做了解释。</p> 
<p>“为什么呢？”公爵感到很内疚，“真的，您这一切监视和守护只会折磨我。我一个人感到很寂寞．我对您说过好几次了，而您自己不停地挥手和踞着脚走来走去更使我感到烦闷。”</p> 
<p>公爵指的是，虽然在病人需要静养的借口下赶开了所有家里的人，可是列别杰夫自己在这三天里差不多一刻不停地走到公爵这里来，每次先是打开门，探进个头来，环顾着房间，就像想确信，公爵是否在这里？有没有逃走？然后就踞着脚，悄悄地慢慢地走近扶手椅，因而往往无意中吓着自己的房客。他不断地询问，公爵是否需要什么，当公爵终于向他指出，请他别打扰他时，他就顺从地、默默无言地转过身，踞着脚向问口移步，一边走一边连连挥手，仿佛是要人知道，他仅仅如此而已，他一句话也没有说，他马上就走出去，而且不再来了，可是过了十分钟或者至多一刻钟便又出现了。科利亚有进公爵房里去的自由，这一点使列别杰夫深为伤感，甚至颇为见怪和忿忿不平。利利亚注意到，他经常在门口站上半小时，偷听他和公爵的谈话，当然他把这件事告诉了公爵。</p> 
<p>“您简直就把我据为已有，把我锁了起来，”公爵表示反对说，“至少在别墅我想不要这样子，请您放心，我将爱见准就见谁，想去哪儿就去哪儿。”</p> 
<p>“这丝毫不成问题，”列别杰夫挥手说道。</p> 
<p>公爵把他从头到脚专注地打量了一番。</p> 
<p>“鲁基扬·季莫菲耶维奇，您是否把吊在您床头的一个小柜搬到这儿来了？”</p> 
<p>“没有，没搬来。”</p> 
<p>“难道就把它留在那儿了？”</p> 
<p>“不好搬，要把它从墙里拔出来……嵌得很牢很牢。”</p> 
<p>“也许，这里也有这样的吊柜？”</p> 
<p>“甚至更好，甚至更好，是和别墅一起买下来的。”</p> 
<p>“啊……啊，您刚才不让谁到我这儿来？一小时以前。”</p> 
<p>“这是……这是将军。确实没让他进来，他也不该到您这儿来。公爵，我对这个人怀着深深的敬意，这是个……这是个了不起的人物您不相信吗，好吧，您以后就会知道的，可是反正……尊敬的公爵，您最好还是不要在自己这儿接待他。”</p> 
<p>“请问，这是为什么？还有，列别杰夫，您现在为什么要踞着脚站着，老是走近我跟前，就像想在我耳边告诉什么秘密似的。”</p> 
<p>“我卑贱，我卑贱，我自己也感觉到，”列别杰夫很动感情地捶着自己的胸脯，突然回答说，“对您来说，将军是不是太好客了。”</p> 
<p>“太好客。”</p> 
<p>“是太好客，第一，他已经打算注我这里，这倒也随他去，他还很好激动，马上攀起亲戚来了。我跟他已经算过好几次亲戚，原来我们还是自家人。您也原来是他的表外甥呢，还是昨天他才向我讲清楚。既然您是他的表外甥，这么说，尊敬的公爵，我和您也成了亲戚，这也没什么，是他的小毛病，但是他刚才要入相信，他这一生，从当准尉开始到去年６月１１日，每天他家里坐下来吃饭的人总不少十二百人，最后竟把话说到这样：这些人甚至都不站起来了，就这样吃了中饭吃晚饭，再喝茶，”昼夜１５个小时坐在餐桌旁，三十年连续不断，没有丝毫问歇，几乎连换台布的时间也没有，一个起身走了，另一个则来了，而在假日和皇家节日时来者达三百人。俄罗斯建立千年纪念日那天他统计了，竟有七百人。这可真是不得了！这样的情况是很糟糕的迹象；要接待这样好客的人简直可怕，所以我才想：对于您和我来说，这样的人是不是太好客了。”</p> 
<p>“但是，您和他好像关系挺不错嘛？”</p> 
<p>“像兄弟一般，是闹着玩的，就算是自家人，对我来说只会更光彩。通过二百个人吃饭和俄罗斯千年纪念的事，我甚至看出他是个非常出色的人，我这是说的真心话，公爵，您刚才说到秘密，也就是，说我走近来似乎想告诉什么秘密。就像故意似的，倒也真的有秘密：那位知名人物刚才表示，很想跟您秘密会面一次。”</p> 
<p>“为什么要秘密呢，绝不需要。我自己到她那里去，哪怕是今天就去。”</p> 
<p>“绝对不行，绝对不行，”列别杰夫连连挥起手来，”她怕的并不是您所想的事。顺便告诉您：那个恶棍简直是每天都来探询您的健廉状况，您知道吗？”</p> 
<p>“您好像常常称他是恶棍，对此我很表怀疑。”</p> 
<p>“您不用任何怀疑的，”不用的，”列别杰夫赶快把话盆开，“我只想说明，那位知名人物怕的不是他而完全是另一个人，完全是另一个人。”</p> 
<p>“到底怕什么，快说！”公爵望着装模作样，故作神秘的列别杰夫，不耐烦地问道。</p> 
<p>“秘密就在这里。”</p> 
<p>列别杰夫窃笑了一下。</p> 
<p>“准的秘密。”</p> 
<p>“您的秘密，尊敬的公爵，您自己禁止我在您面前说……”列别杰夫嘟哝着说，他把公爵的好奇心逗到近乎病态的难以忍耐的程度，以此而感到一种满足，末了突然说，“她怕阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜。”</p> 
<p>公爵皱了一下眉头，沉默了一会儿。</p> 
<p>“说真的，列别杰夫，我要放弃住您的别墅，”他突然说，“加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇和普季岑夫妇在哪里？您把他们也招引来了。”</p> 
<p>“马上就到，马上就到。紧跟着他们甚至将军也要来。我要把所有的门都打开，把所有的女儿部叫来，马上叫来，马上统统都叫来，”列别杰夫惊慌地低语着，一边不停地挥动双手，从一扇问奔向另一扇门。</p> 
<p>就在这时科利亚来到了露台，他是从外面进来的，并且宣布，他后面要有客人来，是叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜及其三个女儿。</p> 
<p>“让不让普季岑夫妇和加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇进来？让不让将军进来？”列别杰夫听到消息大为惊讶，急急跑近来问。</p> 
<p>“为什么不？让所有愿意来的人都进来！列别杰夫，请您相信，您好像一开始就没有正确理解我的态度；您总是不断地犯错误。我没有丝毫缘由要隐藏和躲避谁，”公爵笑着说。</p> 
<p>看着公爵笑，列别杰夫认为有义务跟着他笑。尽管他异常激动不安，但仍然看得出非常满意。</p> 
<p>科利亚报告的消息是正确的，他赶在叶潘钦家的人前面仅仅早到几步，以便通知她们来到，因此客人们一。下子就从两面出现了，叶潘钦家的人从露台上来，普季岑夫妇、加尼亚和伊沃尔京将军从房间里来。</p> 
<p>叶潘钦家知道公爵发病和他在帕夫洛夫斯克，是刚从科利亚那里获悉的，在这以前将军夫人还在苦恼和困惑。前天将军把公爵的名片带给了家里人，这张名片激发起叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜绝对的信心，认为公爵本人一定会在这张名片之后来彼得堡与他们见面。小姐们则要她相信，一个半年没有写信的人，也许，现在也远远不会这么急于来见他们，大概，没有他们他在彼得堡也有够多忙碌的事，准知道呢？可是这些劝说是白费口舌。将军夫人对于这些意见大力生气并准备打赌，认为公爵至少第二天一定会来，虽然“这已经是姗姗来迟了”。第二天她等了一上午；等他来吃午餐，又等他到傍晚。当天色已经完全黑下来时，叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜对什么都大发脾气，跟谁都大吵一通，当然，在吵架原因上根本不提公爵。整个第三天也只字不提他。阿格拉娅在用午餐时无意间脱口说，妈妈生气是因为公爵没有来，对此将军立即指出，“他在这件事可没有错，”---叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜马上站起身，忿忿地从桌旁走开了。终于，傍晚时分科利亚来了，带来了所有的消息，还描述了他所知道的公爵的全部遭遇，结果叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜高兴极了，但是不管怎么样，科利亚还是被很狠地数落了一通，“要不整天整天在这儿转悠，赶也赶不走，可这一回，即使你自己决定不来，哪怕告诉你也好。”科利亚本来真想为“赶也赶不走”这句话生气，但是他还是把这句话搁到一旁再说，要不是这句活太叫人见怪，他也许也就不计较了，因为叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜在获悉公爵发病的消息时所表现出来的激动不安，他还是喜欢的，她很长时间坚持必须马上派专人去彼得堡，请某个一流名医乘第一趟火车赶来。但是女儿们劝阻了她，不过，当母亲一叫她又打算去探望病人时，她们也不甘落后。</p> 
<p>“他生命垂危，”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜一边忙乱着一边说，“可你们还在这里讲究礼仪！他是不是我们家的朋友？”</p> 
<p>“未知深浅，且莫涉水，”阿格拉娅刚开始发表意见。</p> 
<p>“那好吧，你就别去了，甚至这样还很好，不然，叶甫盖尼·帕夫雷奇来了，没人接待他。”</p> 
<p>有了这儿句话，阿格拉娅当然立即跟着大家走了，其实，即使没有这句话她也是打算要去的。坐在阿杰莱达旁边的ω公爵应她的请求马上就同意让她去。还是以前他开始结识叶潘钦家人的时候，听他们说起公爵，他就表示出异常的兴趣。原来他认识公爵，他还是不久前结识的，还一起在某个城住过两个星期。这大约是三个月前的事。ω公爵甚至讲了许多有关公爵的情况，总的来说他对公爵相当好感，因此现在由衷地高兴去探望老相识。伊万·费奥多罗维奇将军这次不在家。叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇也还没有来。</p> 
<p>从叶潘钦家至列别杰夫的别墅不超过三百步，叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲夫娜到公爵这儿，第一个不愉快的印象便是在他周围遇见了一大群客人，已经不用说，在这一群人中有二三个人是她十分痛恨的；第二则是惊讶，因为她看到向她们迎面走来的是个乍看起来完全是健康的年轻人，而不是她意想中会见到的躺在病榻上生命垂危的人，而且他衣着讲究，笑容可掬。她甚至茫然不知所措地停住了。科利亚非常满足。当然，在将军夫人尚未从自已别墅动身的时候，他本可以解释清楚，没有谁奄奄一息，也没有人生命垂危，但是他没作解释，他狡猾地预感到，将军夫人看到自己诚挚的朋友身体健康，一定会大发脾气，会可笑地气忿难平。科利亚甚至很不客气他说出了自己的猜测，想要惹恼叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜；尽管他与将军夫人存在着友谊，但他还是常常招惹挖苦她。</p> 
<p>“等一等，亲爱的，别急，别扫了自己的兴！”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲夫娜回答说，一边坐到公爵为她摆好的扶手椅上。</p> 
<p>列别杰夫，普季岑，伊沃尔京将军急忙奔过去为小姐们搬椅子。将军为阿格拉娅搬了椅子，列别杰夫也给ω公爵摆了椅子，与此同时弯着腰以表示其异常恭敬的态度，瓦里娅像通常那样欣喜而又低声地与小姐们打了招呼。</p> 
<p>“公爵，我真的以为大概会看见你躺在床上，是因为害怕才在想象中夸大了，我现在也决不撒谎，看着你一脸喜气洋洋的样子，我反而气恼得要命，但是我向你起誓，这不过是没有来得及好好思考前另。一会儿的情绪。一经思考，我说话做事总是更聪明些，我想你也是这样。说真的，假如我有亲生儿子，也许对他身体康复还不会像见到你恢复健康这样高兴；如果你对此不相信我，那么你应该感到羞愧，而不是我。而这个恶小子跟我还不只是这样闹着玩。好像你是庇护他的，那么我警告你，总有一天我会更乐意放弃与他结交的荣幸请相信我的话。”</p> 
<p>“我又什么地方得罪您了？”科利亚嚷起来说，“无论我说了多少回要您才信，公爵几乎已经恢复健康，您却不愿相信，因为您设想他生命垂危躺在听床上，这会有意思得多。”</p> 
<p>“到我们这儿来住多久？”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜转向公爵说。</p> 
<p>“整个夏天，也许更长些。”</p> 
<p>“你还是一个人？没有结婚？”</p> 
<p>“没有，没有结婚，”公爵对她这种幼稚的挖苦话付之一笑。</p> 
<p>“这没什么好笑的，这是常有的事。现在我说别墅，为什么不搬到我们那儿去住？我们有整间厢房是空着的，不过，随你便。你现在是租他的住吗？这个人，”她朝列别杰夫那儿点了下头，低声追问道，“他干吗老是做鬼脸？”</p> 
<p>这时维拉像通常一样抱着孩子从房间里走到露台上来。列别杰夫在椅子旁点头哈腰张罗，同时却不知道干什么是好，但又极不愿意离开，这时便转向维拉，朝她连连挥手，赶她离开露台，甚至忘了场台，连连跺脚。</p> 
<p>“他疯了吗？”突然将军夫人补充问。</p> 
<p>“不，他……”</p> 
<p>“也许是喝醉了？你的伙伴可不怎么样，”她的目光扫视了其余的客人后断然说，“不过，姑娘却多么可爱呀！她是谁？”</p> 
<p>“这是维拉·鲁基扬诺夫娜。这个列别杰夫的女儿。”</p> 
<p>“啊！……非常可爱。我想跟她认识一下。”</p> 
<p>但是，列别杰夫听到了叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜的夸赞，自己己拖着女儿过来介绍了。</p> 
<p>“孤儿，全是孤儿！”他走到跟前，有气无力地凄然说，“她抱着的这个孩子也是孤儿，是她的妹妹，叫柳鲍芙，完全是合法婚生的，我那刚去世的妻子叶列娜六个月前死于分娩，这是上帝的旨意……是啊……虽然她只是姐姐，可就得代替母亲照料妹妹了，她不过是姐姐……不过是……不过是……”</p> 
<p>“而你这个当爹的不过是个傻瓜，对不起。好，够了，我想你自己也明白。”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜突然异常气愤地断然说。</p> 
<p>“千真万确。”列别杰夫恭敬地深深鞠了一躬。</p> 
<p>“听着，列别杰夫先生，有人说你在阐释《启示录》，是真的吗？”阿格拉娅问。</p> 
<p>“千真万确……第十五个年头了。”</p> 
<p>“我听说过你的事。好像还在报上刊载过有关您的报道，是吗？”</p> 
<p>“不，这是讲的另一个人，是另一个人，那人已经死了，而在他之后就剩下我了，”列别杰夫得意忘形地说。</p> 
<p>“看在邻居的份上，劳驾您近日内什么时候给我讲讲，我一点也不懂《启示录》。”</p> 
<p>“我不能不提醒您，阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜，这一切在他来说纯粹是招摇撞骗，请相信我，”伊沃尔京突然很快地插进来说。他千方百计想怎么开口讲话，等得焦急，如坐针毡；现在他在阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜身旁坐下。“当然，住别墅的人有自己的权利，”他继续说道，“也有自己的乐趣，接受这么一位不同寻常的因特鲁斯来阐释《启示录》也未尝不是一种娱乐，跟别的娱乐一样，甚至还是绝妙的智力游戏，但是我……您望着我好像很惊讶？我很荣幸向您作自我介绍--伊沃尔京将军。我还曾经抱过您呢，阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜。”</p> 
<p>“见到您非常高兴。我认识瓦尔瓦拉·阿尔达利翁诺夫娜和尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜，”阿格拉娅竭力克制自己不要放声大笑出来，低声咕哝着说。</p> 
<p>叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜发火了。早就蓄积在心中的怒气突然要求宣泄。她无法忍受伊沃尔京将军，她过去认识他，但已是很久前的事了。</p> 
<p>“你在胡说，老爷，这是家常便饭了，你从来也没有抱过她，”她忿忿然不客气地对他说。</p> 
<p>“妈妈，您忘了，他真的抱过我，在特维尔，”阿格拉娅忽然证实说，“我们那时住在特维尔。我当时六岁，我记得。他给我做了弓和箭，教我射箭，我还射死了一只鸽子。您记得吗，我和您一起射死鸽子的事？”</p> 
<p>“当时他给我带来了硬板纸做的头盔和木剑，我还记得！”阿杰莱达喊了起来。</p> 
<p>“我也记得这一点，”亚历山德拉证实说，“你们那时还为了受伤的鸽子而吵嘴，结果被分开罚站墙角，阿杰莱达就戴着头盔、拿着木剑站着。”</p> 
<p>＊因待鲁斯，此处原为法语俄译音，意力“冒名者”。</p> 
<p>将军对阿格拉娅声称，他曾经抱过她，他之所以这么说，只是为了开始谈话，也仅仅是因为他跟所有的年轻人攀谈几乎总是这样开始的，如果他认为有必要跟他们结识。可是这一次，仿佛故意似的，他说的恰恰是真话，又仿佛故意似的，他自己又偏偏忘了这一件事。因此，当阿格拉娅此刻忽然证实，她与他两人一起射死了鸽子时，他的记忆一下子豁然大悟，自己也回忆起所有这一切乃至细枝未节，已是暮年的人回忆起遥远过去的某件往事往往是这样的。很难表述这种回忆对这个可怜的，通常带着几分醉意的将军产生多么强烈的作用，但是他终究猛然大受感动。</p> 
<p>“我记得，全部记得！”他喊了起来说，“我当时是上尉。您是这么一丁点儿小，非常讨人喜欢。尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜……加尼亚……。我常到你们家……去作客。伊万·费奥多罗维奇……”</p> 
<p>“瞧你，你现在都落到什么地步了！”将军夫人接过话茬说，“既然你这么受感动，这么说，你到底还没有把自己的高尚感情都喝光！把妻子折磨苦了。本该给孩子们作出表率，可你却坐进监狱，老爷，从这儿走开吧，随便走到哪儿，站到门背后角落里去哭一通，回忆一下自己清白的过去，也许上帝会宽恕你，去吧，去吧，我对你可是说正经的。改邪归正的最好办法莫过于带着追悔的心情回忆过去。”</p> 
<p>但是无须重复说对他说的是正经话。正像所有经常醉醉醇的人一样，将军非常容易动感情，又像所有堕落太甚的酒鬼那样，不那么容易承受得注对昔日幸福的回忆。他站起身，温顺地向门边走去，以致叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜马上又可怜起他来。</p> 
<p>“阿尔达利翁·亚历山德雷奇，老爷！”她冲着他背后喊了一“声，“停一下；我们大家都是有罪过的人，等你感到自己较少受到良心责备时，再到我这儿来，我们一起坐一会，聊聊过去。也许，我自己的罪孽比起你来要深重五十倍；而现在再见吧，走吧，这儿没你的事……”她忽然害怕他又回转来。</p> 
<p>“您暂时最好别跟着他，”公爵制止了本已跟在父亲后面跑去的科利亚说，“不然，这一会儿他就会懊恼起来，一切便前功尽弃了。”</p> 
<p>“这倒是真的，别去碰他，过半小时再去，”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜决定了说。</p> 
<p>“瞧，一生中哪怕说一次真话有多大意义，竟感动得流泪。”列别杰夫壮着胆子插话说。</p> 
<p>“如果我听到的都属实的话，那么你这个爷们大概也是个好样的，”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫赐马上就止住了他。</p> 
<p>聚集在公爵这里的所有客人之间的相互关系渐渐地确定了下来。公爵自然能够认识并且也已经认识到将军夫人及其女儿们对他的十分关切，当然也诚挚地对她们说，在他们来拜访前，他自己就打算，尽管自己有病，时间又已经晚了，今天可一定要到她们那里去。叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜瞥了一眼公爵的客人，回答说，就现在也可以这样做。普季岑为人很有礼貌也很知趣，很快便起身告退，到列别杰夫的厢房去，而且也很想把列别杰夫本人一起引走。列别杰夫应允马上就来；此时瓦里娅在跟小姐们在交谈，因此留了下来。她和加尼亚对自己的将军父亲离开感到相当高兴；加尼亚自己后来也很快地跟在普季岑后面走了。在露台上逗留的那一会儿，虽然叶潘钦家的人在场，他举止谦恭温顺又不失尊严，叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜两次将他从头到脚打量个遍，他也丝毫没有因为她那咄咄逼人的目光而显得不知所措，确实，过去了解他的人会想，他变了许多。阿格拉娅很喜欢这种变化。</p> 
<p>“这是加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇出去了吗？、她突然问。她有时候喜欢这样做，用自己的问题大声、生硬地打断别人的谈话，同时又不是向哪个个人提问。</p> 
<p>“是他，”公爵回答说。</p> 
<p>“我差点没认出他来，他变了许多……变好得多了。”</p> 
<p>“我很为他高兴。”公爵说。</p> 
<p>“他大病了一场，”瓦里娅怀着欢悦和同情补充说。</p> 
<p>“哪一点上他变好了？”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜几乎大为惊吓和困惑不解，怒冲冲地问着，“哪来的根据？丝毫也没有变好。你觉得他究竟什么变好了？”</p> 
<p>“再没有比‘可怜的骑士，更好的了！”科利亚一直站在叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜的椅子旁，这时却突然宣称说。</p> 
<p>“我自己也这么想，”出公爵说完，笑了起来。</p> 
<p>“我完全赞同这个意见，”阿杰莱达郑重宣布。</p> 
<p>“什么‘可怜的骑士，？”将军夫人问，一边困惑和烦恼地打量着所有说话的人，当她看见阿格拉娅满脸通红时，生气地补充说，“简直是胡说八道！什么‘可怜的骑士’？”</p> 
<p>“你宠爱的这个男孩难道是第一次歪曲别人的话吗？”阿格拉娅傲慢而愤怒。</p> 
<p>阿格拉娅每次发怒的时候（而她经常发怒）尽管正言厉色、毫不容情，但也几乎每次都流露出还有点孩子气的、不耐烦的学生样，并且掩饰得也不高明，因此别人瞧着她，有时不能不发笑，这又使她异常恼火：因为她不明白人家笑什么，“他们怎么能，怎么敢笑，”现在连姐姐们，因公爵也在笑，甚至列夫·尼古拉耶维奇公爵本人也莞尔一笑、也不知为什么涨红了脸。科利亚哈哈大笑，得意非凡。阿格拉娅这回生气可不是闹着玩的，这倒反而使她变得格外妩媚动人了。她的窘态对她非常相称，于是随即她又为自己这种窘态而暗自着恼。</p> 
<p>“他歪曲您的活还少吗，”她又添了一句。</p> 
<p>“我是以您自己的赞叹为根据的！”科利亚嚷了起来，“一个月前您翻阅《堂·吉诃德》时发出了这样的感叹，说再没有比‘可怜的骑士，更好的了。’我不知道您那时说的是谁？是堂·吉诃德还是叶甫盖尼·帕夫雷奇，或者还有什么人，反正是说的某个人，当时我们还交谈了很久……”</p> 
<p>“我看，你妄自猜测是不是大多了点，亲爱的。”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜烦恼地阻止了他说下去。</p> 
<p>“难道仅仅是我一个人这么想吗？”科利亚不甘闭口不言，“那时大家都这么说，就是现在也是；就刚才出公爵，阿杰莱达·伊万诺夫娜，还有所有的人都宣布支持 ‘可怜的骑士’，这么说‘可怜的骑士，是存在的，而且也一定是有的，据我看，要不是阿杰莱达·伊万诺夫娜，那么我们大家早就会知道，谁是‘可怜的骑士了’。”</p> 
<p>“我又哪里做错了？”阿杰莱达笑着说。</p> 
<p>“您不愿意画肖像，这就是您的错！阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜当时请您画一幅‘可怜的骑士’的肖像画，甚至还说了她自己构思的画的袁材，您记得那素材吗？您不愿意……”</p> 
<p>“可是叫我怎么画呢？画谁呢？根据素材来画，这位‘可怜的骑士’</p> 
<p>无论在谁的面前</p> 
<p>都不除去钢面罩</p> 
<p>这样能得出一张什么样的脸呢？画什么？面罩吗？蒙面人？”</p> 
<p>“我一点也不明白，什么面罩！”将军夫人很生气，其实她心里开始很清楚地明白，“可怜的骑士”这个称号指的是谁（看来，这是早就约定的称呼）。但是特别使她恼火的是，列夫·尼古拉耶维奇公爵也在不好意思，后来完全窘得像个１０岁的孩子，“怎么啦，这种愚蠢的把戏有完没完？到底给不给我讲清楚这个‘可怜的骑士’是怎么回事？是不得了的秘密，绝不能让别人知道还是怎么的？”</p> 
<p>但大家只是继续笑着。</p> 
<p>“这是最简单不过的，有一首奇怪的俄罗斯诗歌，”终于出公爵插进来说，显然他想尽快了结这场谈话，改换一个话题，“是关于‘可怜的骑士，的，没有开端和结尾的一个片断。一个月前光景，有一次午餐后大家在一起说笑，照例为阿杰莱达·伊万诺夫娜未来的画寻找素材，您知道，为阿杰莱达·伊万诺夫娜的画寻找素材早日成为全家的共同任务了。于是就谈到了‘可怜的骑士’，谁是第一个说的，我不记得了……”</p> 
<p>“是阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜！”科利亚嚷了起来。</p> 
<p>“也许是，只不过我不记得了，” 公爵继续说，“有的人嘲笑这个素材，另一些人则宜称，没有比这更高级的了，但是要画‘可怜的骑士’无论怎样总得要画脸，于是便开始逐个挑选所有熟人的脸，结果却一张也不合适，事情也就到此为止。这就是全部经过。我不明白，为什么尼古拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇忽然想起来提这件事而且还加以引伸。这在当时是顺便说起，很可笑，而在现在则根本没有什么意思了。”</p> 
<p>“因为又有了另有所指的愚蠢的新花招，既刻薄又欺人，”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜毫不客气地说。</p> 
<p>“除了深深的敬意，没有丝毫愚蠢，”突然阿格拉娅完全出人意料地郑重而又严肃地说，她已经恢复常态，克服了刚才窘迫的神态。不但如此，你看着她，根据某些迹象可以认为，现在她自己也乐意这玩笑开下去，越开越玄妙。她身上发生这一转折的瞬间，正是公爵窘态毕露而且越来越厉害，达到非常明显的地步。</p> 
<p>“一会儿像个疯子似的放声大笑，一会又突然表示深深的敬意！真是疯了！为什么要尊敬？马上给我说，为什么你无缘无故忽然就有了深深的敬意。”</p> 
<p>“之所以有深深的敬意，”阿格拉娅依然那样郑重和严肃地回答母亲，那几乎是充满愤恨的问题，“是因为在这首诗里就描写了一个有理想的人；其次，既然确立了理想，就会把它作为信仰，而有了信仰，就会不顾一切地把自己的一生奉献给它。在我们这个时代这是不常有的。在这首诗里没有说‘可怜的骑士’的理想究竟是什么，但可以看得出，这是一个光明的形象，‘纯洁的美的形象’，而热衷于自己信仰的骑士脖子上不是系着围巾而是挂着念珠。确实，那诗里还有一句令人费解、同意未尽的箴言，他写在自己盾牌上的三个字母：Ａ，Ｈ。Ｂ……”</p> 
<p>“是Ａ，Ｈ，贝，”科利亚纠正说。</p> 
<p>“可我说是Ａ。Ｈ。Ｂ，而且我愿意这样讲，”阿格拉娅烦恼地打断他说，“不论怎么样，有一点是很清楚的：不论他的女士是什么人，也不管她做什么事，对这个可怜的骑士来说都无所谓。是</p>
