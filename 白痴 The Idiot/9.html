Gania was motionless with horror.</p> 
<p>Nastasia's arrival was a most unexpected and overwhelming event to all parties. In the first place, she had never been before. Up to now she had been so haughty that she had never even asked Gania to introduce her to his parents. Of late she had not so much as mentioned them. Gania was partly glad of this; but still he had put it to her debit in the account to be settled after marriage.</p> 
<p>He would have borne anything from her rather than this visit. But one thing seemed to him quite clear-her visit now, and the present of her portrait on this particular day, pointed out plainly enough which way she intended to make her decision!</p> 
<p>The incredulous amazement with which all regarded the prince did not last long, for Nastasia herself appeared at the door and passed in, pushing by the prince again.</p> 
<p>"At last I've stormed the citadel! Why do you tie up your bell?" she said, merrily, as she pressed Gania's hand, the latter having rushed up to her as soon as she made her appearance. "What are you looking so upset about? Introduce me, please!"</p> 
<p>The bewildered Gania introduced her first to Varia, and both women, before shaking hands, exchanged looks of strange import. Nastasia, however, smiled amiably; but Varia did not try to look amiable, and kept her gloomy expression. She did not even vouchsafe the usual courteous smile of etiquette. Gania darted a terrible glance of wrath at her for this, but Nina Alexandrovna, mended matters a little when Gania introduced her at last. Hardly, however, had the old lady begun about her " highly gratified feelings," and so on, when Nastasia left her, and flounced into a chair by Gania's side in the corner by the window, and cried: "Where's your study? and where are the--the lodgers? You do take in lodgers, don't you?"</p> 
<p>Gania looked dreadfully put out, and tried to say something in reply, but Nastasia interrupted him:</p> 
<p>"Why, where are you going to squeeze lodgers in here? Don't you use a study? Does this sort of thing pay?" she added, turning to Nina Alexandrovna.</p> 
<p>"Well, it is troublesome, rather," said the latter; "but I suppose it will 'pay' pretty well. We have only just begun, however--"</p> 
<p>Again Nastasia Philipovna did not hear the sentence out. She glanced at Gania, and cried, laughing, "What a face! My goodness, what a face you have on at this moment!"</p> 
<p>Indeed, Gania did not look in the least like himself. His bewilderment and his alarmed perplexity passed off, however, and his lips now twitched with rage as he continued to stare evilly at his laughing guest, while his countenance became absolutely livid.</p> 
<p>There was another witness, who, though standing at the door motionless and bewildered himself, still managed to remark Gania's death-like pallor, and the dreadful change that had come over his face. This witness was the prince, who now advanced in alarm and muttered to Gania:</p> 
<p>"Drink some water, and don't look like that!"</p> 
<p>It was clear that he came out with these words quite spontaneously, on the spur of the moment. But his speech was productive of much--for it appeared that all. Gania's rage now overflowed upon the prince. He seized him by the shoulder and gazed with an intensity of loathing and revenge at him, but said nothing--as though his feelings were too strong to permit of words.</p> 
<p>General agitation prevailed. Nina Alexandrovna gave a little cry of anxiety; Ptitsin took a step forward in alarm; Colia and Ferdishenko stood stock still at the door in amazement;--only Varia remained coolly watching the scene from under her eyelashes. She did not sit down, but stood by her mother with folded hands. However, Gania recollected himself almost immediately. He let go of the prince and burst out laughing.</p> 
<p>"Why, are you a doctor, prince, or what?" he asked, as naturally as possible. "I declare you quite frightened me! Nastasia Philipovna, let me introduce this interesting character to you-- though I have only known him myself since the morning."</p> 
<p>Nastasia gazed at the prince in bewilderment. "Prince? He a Prince? Why, I took him for the footman, just now, and sent him in to announce me! Ha, ha, ha, isn't that good!"</p> 
<p>"Not bad that, not bad at all!" put in Ferdishenko, "se non e vero--"</p> 
<p>"I rather think I pitched into you, too, didn't I? Forgive me--do! Who is he, did you say? What prince? Muishkin?" she added, addressing Gania.</p> 
<p>"He is a lodger of ours," explained the latter.</p> 
<p>"An idiot!"--the prince distinctly heard the word half whispered from behind him. This was Ferdishenko's voluntary information for Nastasia's benefit.</p> 
<p>"Tell me, why didn't you put me right when I made such a dreadful mistake just now?" continued the latter, examining the prince from head to foot without the slightest ceremony. She awaited the answer as though convinced that it would be so foolish that she must inevitably fail to restrain her laughter over it.</p> 
<p>"I was astonished, seeing you so suddenly--" murmured the prince.</p> 
<p>"How did you know who I was? Where had you seen me before? And why were you so struck dumb at the sight of me? What was there so overwhelming about me?"</p> 
<p>"Oho! ho, ho, ho!" cried Ferdishenko. "NOW then, prince! My word, what things I would say if I had such a chance as that! My goodness, prince--go on!"</p> 
<p>"So should I, in your place, I've no doubt!" laughed the prince to Ferdishenko; then continued, addressing Nastasia: "Your portrait struck me very forcibly this morning; then I was talking about you to the Epanchins; and then, in the train, before I reached Petersburg, Parfen Rogojin told me a good deal about you; and at the very moment that I opened the door to you I happened to be thinking of you, when--there you stood before me!"</p> 
<p>"And how did you recognize me?"</p> 
<p>"From the portrait!"</p> 
<p>"What else?"</p> 
<p>"I seemed to imagine you exactly as you are--I seemed to have seen you somewhere."</p> 
<p>"Where--where?"</p> 
<p>"I seem to have seen your eyes somewhere; but it cannot be! I have not seen you--I never was here before. I may have dreamed of you, I don't know."</p> 
<p>The prince said all this with manifest effort--in broken sentences, and with many drawings of breath. He was evidently much agitated. Nastasia Philipovna looked at him inquisitively, but did not laugh.</p> 
<p>"Bravo, prince!" cried Ferdishenko, delighted.</p> 
<p>At this moment a loud voice from behind the group which hedged in the prince and Nastasia Philipovna, divided the crowd, as it were, and before them stood the head of the family, General Ivolgin. He was dressed in evening clothes; his moustache was dyed.</p> 
<p>This apparition was too much for Gania. Vain and ambitious almost to morbidness, he had had much to put up with in the last two months, and was seeking feverishly for some means of enabling himself to lead a more presentable kind of existence. At home, he now adopted an attitude of absolute cynicism, but he could not keep this up before Nastasia Philipovna, although he had sworn to make her pay after marriage for all he suffered now. He was experiencing a last humiliation, the bitterest of all, at this moment--the humiliation of blushing for his own kindred in his own house. A question flashed through his mind as to whether the game was really worth the candle.</p> 
<p>For that had happened at this moment, which for two months had been his nightmare; which had filled his soul with dread and shame--the meeting between his father and Nastasia Philipovna. He had often tried to imagine such an event, but had found the picture too mortifying and exasperating, and had quietly dropped it. Very likely he anticipated far worse things than was at all necessary; it is often so with vain persons. He had long since determined, therefore, to get his father out of the way, anywhere, before his marriage, in order to avoid such a meeting; but when Nastasia entered the room just now, he had been so overwhelmed with astonishment, that he had not thought of his father, and had made no arrangements to keep him out of the way. And now it was too late--there he was, and got up, too, in a dress coat and white tie, and Nastasia in the very humour to heap ridicule on him and his family circle; of this last fact, he felt quite persuaded. What else had she come for? There were his mother and his sister sitting before her, and she seemed to have forgotten their very existence already; and if she behaved like that, he thought, she must have some object in view.</p> 
<p>Ferdishenko led the general up to Nastasia Philipovna.</p> 
<p>"Ardalion Alexandrovitch Ivolgin," said the smiling general, with a low bow of great dignity, "an old soldier, unfortunate, and the father of this family; but happy in the hope of including in that family so exquisite--"</p> 
<p>He did not finish his sentence, for at this moment Ferdishenko pushed a chair up from behind, and the general, not very firm on his legs, at this post-prandial hour, flopped into it backwards. It was always a difficult thing to put this warrior to confusion, and his sudden descent left him as composed as before. He had sat down just opposite to Nastasia, whose fingers he now took, and raised to his lips with great elegance, and much courtesy. The general had once belonged to a very select circle of society, but he had been turned out of it two or three years since on account of certain weaknesses, in which he now indulged with all the less restraint; but his good manners remained with him to this day, in spite of all.</p> 
<p>Nastasia Philipovna seemed delighted at the appearance of this latest arrival, of whom she had of course heard a good deal by report.</p> 
<p>"I have heard that my son--" began Ardalion Alexandrovitch.</p> 
<p>"Your son, indeed! A nice papa you are! YOU might have come to see me anyhow, without compromising anyone. Do you hide yourself, or does your son hide you?"</p> 
<p>"The children of the nineteenth century, and their parents--" began the general, again.</p> 
<p>"Nastasia Philipovna, will you excuse the general for a moment? Someone is inquiring for him," said Nina Alexandrovna in a loud voice, interrupting the conversation.</p> 
<p>"Excuse him? Oh no, I have wished to see him too long for that. Why, what business can he have? He has retired, hasn't he? You won't leave me, general, will you?"</p> 
<p>"I give you my word that he shall come and see you--but he--he needs rest just now."</p> 
<p>"General, they say you require rest," said Nastasia Philipovna, with the melancholy face of a child whose toy is taken away.</p> 
<p>Ardalion Alexandrovitch immediately did his best to make his foolish position a great deal worse.</p> 
<p>"My dear, my dear!" he said, solemnly and reproachfully, looking at his wife, with one hand on his heart.</p> 
<p>"Won't you leave the room, mamma?" asked Varia, aloud.</p> 
<p>"No, Varia, I shall sit it out to the end."</p> 
<p>Nastasia must have overheard both question and reply, but her vivacity was not in the least damped. On the contrary, it seemed to increase. She immediately overwhelmed the general once more with questions, and within five minutes that gentleman was as happy as a king, and holding forth at the top of his voice, amid the laughter of almost all who heard him.</p> 
<p>Colia jogged the prince's arm.</p> 
<p>"Can't YOU get him out of the room, somehow? DO, please," and tears of annoyance stood in the boy's eyes. "Curse that Gania!" he muttered, between his teeth.</p> 
<p>"Oh yes, I knew General Epanchin well," General Ivolgin was saying at this moment; "he and Prince Nicolai Ivanovitch Muishkin--whose son I have this day embraced after an absence of twenty years--and I, were three inseparables. Alas one is in the grave, torn to pieces by calumnies and bullets; another is now before you, still battling with calumnies and bullets--"</p> 
<p>"Bullets?" cried Nastasia.</p> 
<p>"Yes, here in my chest. I received them at the siege of Kars, and I feel them in bad weather now. And as to the third of our trio, Epanchin, of course after that little affair with the poodle in the railway carriage, it was all UP between us."</p> 
<p>"Poodle? What was that? And in a railway carriage? Dear me," said Nastasia, thoughtfully, as though trying to recall something to mind.</p> 
<p>"Oh, just a silly, little occurrence, really not worth telling, about Princess Bielokonski's governess, Miss Smith, and--oh, it is really not worth telling!"</p> 
<p>"No, no, we must have it!" cried Nastasia merrily.</p> 
<p>"Yes, of course," said Ferdishenko. "C'est du nouveau."</p> 
<p>"Ardalion," said Nina Alexandrovitch, entreatingly.</p> 
<p>"Papa, you are wanted!" cried Colia.</p> 
<p>"Well, it is a silly little story, in a few words," began the delighted general. "A couple of years ago, soon after the new railway was opened, I had to go somewhere or other on business. Well, I took a first-class ticket, sat down, and began to smoke, or rather CONTINUED to smoke, for I had lighted up before. I was alone in the carriage. Smoking is not allowed, but is not prohibited either; it is half allowed--so to speak, winked at. I had the window open."</p> 
<p>"Suddenly, just before the whistle, in came two ladies with a little poodle, and sat down opposite to me; not bad-looking women; one was in light blue, the other in black silk. The poodle, a beauty with a silver collar, lay on light blue's knee. They looked haughtily about, and talked English together. I took no notice, just went on smoking. I observed that the ladies were getting angry--over my cigar, doubtless. One looked at me through her tortoise-shell eyeglass.</p> 
<p>"I took no notice, because they never said a word. If they didn't like the cigar, why couldn't they say so? Not a word, not a hint! Suddenly, and without the very slightest suspicion of warning, 'light blue' seizes my cigar from between my fingers, and, wheugh! out of the window with it! Well, on flew the train, and I sat bewildered, and the young woman, tall and fair, and rather red in the face, too red, glared at me with flashing eyes.</p> 
<p>"I didn't say a word, but with extreme courtesy, I may say with most refined courtesy, I reached my finger and thumb over towards the poodle, took it up delicately by the nape of the neck, and chucked it out of the window, after the cigar. The train went flying on, and the poodle's yells were lost in the distance."</p> 
<p>"Oh, you naughty man!" cried Nastasia, laughing and clapping her hands like a child.</p> 
<p>"Bravo!" said Ferdishenko. Ptitsin laughed too, though he had been very sorry to see the general appear. Even Colia laughed and said, "Bravo!"</p> 
<p>"And I was right, truly right," cried the general, with warmth and solemnity, "for if cigars are forbidden in railway carriages, poodles are much more so."</p> 
<p>"Well, and what did the lady do?" asked Nastasia, impatiently.</p> 
<p>" She--ah, that's where all the mischief of it lies!" replied Ivolgin, frowning. "Without a word, as it were, of warning, she slapped me on the cheek! An extraordinary woman!"</p> 
<p>"And you?"</p> 
<p>The general dropped his eyes, and elevated his brows; shrugged his shoulders, tightened his lips, spread his hands, and remained silent. At last he blurted out:</p> 
<p>"I lost my head!"</p> 
<p>"Did you hit her?"</p> 
<p>"No, oh no!--there was a great flare-up, but I didn't hit her! I had to struggle a little, purely to defend myself; but the very devil was in the business. It turned out that 'light blue' was an Englishwoman, governess or something, at Princess Bielokonski's, and the other woman was one of the old-maid princesses Bielokonski. Well, everybody knows what great friends the princess and Mrs. Epanchin are, so there was a pretty kettle of fish. All the Bielokonskis went into mourning for the poodle. Six princesses in tears, and the Englishwoman shrieking!</p> 
<p>"Of course I wrote an apology, and called, but they would not receive either me or my apology, and the Epanchins cut me, too!"</p> 
<p>"But wait," said Nastasia. "How is it that, five or six days since, I read exactly the same story in the paper, as happening between a Frenchman and an English girl? The cigar was snatched away exactly as you describe, and the poodle was chucked out of the window after it. The slapping came off, too, as in your case; and the girl's dress was light blue!"</p> 
<p>The general blushed dreadfully; Colia blushed too; and Ptitsin turned hastily away. Ferdishenko was the only one who laughed as gaily as before. As to Gania, I need not say that he was miserable; he stood dumb and wretched and took no notice of anybody.</p> 
<p>"I assure you," said the general, "that exactly the same thing happened to myself!"</p> 
<p>"I remembered there was some quarrel between father and Miss Smith, the Bielokonski's governess," said Colia.</p> 
<p>"How very curious, point for point the same anecdote, and happening at different ends of Europe! Even the light blue dress the same," continued the pitiless Nastasia. "I must really send you the paper."</p> 
<p>"You must observe," insisted the general, "that my experience was two years earlier."</p> 
<p>"Ah! that's it, no doubt!"</p> 
<p>Nastasia Philipovna laughed hysterically.</p> 
<p>"Father, will you hear a word from me outside!" said Gania, his voice shaking with agitation, as he seized his father by the shoulder. His eyes shone with a blaze of hatred.</p> 
<p>At this moment there was a terrific bang at the front door, almost enough to break it down. Some most unusual visitor must have arrived. Colia ran to open.</p>  
<p>纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的到来，特别是在这种时刻，对于所有的人都是最奇怪、最费解的意外。就一种情况就够让人吃惊了：纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜是第一次光临；直至现在她的态度十分傲慢，在与加尼亚的交谈中甚至都没有表示过要认识他的家人的愿望，而在最近这段时间里根本连提都不提他们，仿佛他们不存在在世上似的。加尼亚虽然在某种程度上感到高兴，因为可以避开这种对他来说颇为烦神的谈话，但是心里毕竟还是对她这种傲慢存有芥蒂。不论怎样，从她那里他等着得到的多半是对自己家庭的嘲讽和挖苦，而不是来访；他总算知道，她已经明白对于他的婚姻，他家里发生着什么情况以及他的家人会以怎样的目光来看着她。此刻她的来访，在送了照片以后并在她生日这一天，在她许诺要决定他命运的这一天，这一来访几乎就意味着她的决定本身。</p> 
<p>大家困惑不解地望着公爵，这种状况持续并不很久：纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜本人在门口出现了，在她走进房间的时候，又轻轻地推开了一下公爵。</p> 
<p>“总算进来了……你们干吗把门铃系起来了？”她把手递给慌忙奔向她的加尼亚，快活地说，“你这是干吗一副沮丧相？请介绍我……”</p> 
<p>完全不知所措的加尼亚首先把她介绍给瓦里娅，两个女人在彼此伸出手来以前，交换了奇怪的目光，不过，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜笑着，装得兴冲冲的样子；但瓦里娅不想装假阴沉而专注地看着她；在她脸上甚至没有用露出一般礼貌所要求的起码的笑容。加尼亚愣住了；已经没有什么也没有则问来请求了，于是他向瓦里娅投去威胁性的一瞥，就凭这种目光的威力，足以使她明启，此时此刻对她兄长来说意味着什么。于是，她好像决走对他让步，就朝纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜徽微笑了一下（在家里他们大家彼此还是十分相爱的）。尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜稍稍挽回了局面、加尼亚完全昏了头，在介绍了妹妹以后才方绍母亲，甚至把她带到纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜眼前。但是尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜刚开始表示自己“特别高兴”，纳斯塔西娅·费利伯夫娜不等听完她的话，很快就转向加尼亚，而且还没有受到邀请就坐到窗口角落里的一张小沙发上，大声嚷着：</p> 
<p>“您的书房在哪里？还有……房客在哪里？你们不是招房客的吗？”</p> 
<p>加尼亚脸红耳赤，结结巴巴地正要回答什么，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜立即又说：</p> 
<p>“这里哪儿还能招房客住呀？您连书房也没有。那么这有利可图吗？”她突然转向尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜问。</p> 
<p>“是添了些忙碌，”后者刚开始口答，“当然，应该会有收益的。不过，我们刚刚……”</p> 
<p>但是纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜又一次没有听下去：她望着加尼亚，笑着朝他喊了起来：</p> 
<p>“您这张脸怎么啦？喔，我的上帝，瞧您这个时候这张脸！”</p> 
<p>这一笑声持续了好一会几，加尼亚的脸色果然大为变样：他那呆僵木讷、他那滑稽可笑、胆小畏怯的不知所措的神情突然消失了，但是脸色却十分苍白；双唇自为痉挛而歪斜着；他用一种粗野的目光默默地、目不转睛地凝视着继续在笑的女客的脸。</p> 
<p>此时在场的还有一个旁观者，他也还没有摆脱见到纳斯塔西娅·费利怕夫娜面惊讶得目瞪口呆的状态；但是虽然他像根“木柱子”似的原封不动地站在会客室门口，他还是注意到了加尼亚苍白的脸色和变化不祥的神情。他几乎处于惊吓之中，突然机械地迈步向前。</p> 
<p>“去喝点水，”他对加尼亚低语说，“别这样看人……”</p> 
<p>显然，他说这话未经任何思虑，没有任何特别的意图，而只是想到什么说什么；但是他的话却产生了不同寻常的作用。看来，加尼亚的全部怨气突然倾注到公爵身上：他抓住公爵的肩膀，充满仇恨，复仇的心默默望着他，仿佛难以说出话来。这引起了大家的惊慌不安：尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜甚至轻轻喊出了声，普季岑焦急地朝前跨了一步，来到门口的科利亚和费尔迪先科惊愕得停住了，只有瓦里娅一个人依然皱眉蟹额地看着一切，但很注意观察。她没有坐下来，而是双手交叉在胸前站在母亲旁边一侧。</p> 
<p>但是加尼亚马上醒悟过来，几乎就在自己作出这一举动的最初那一刻，他就神经质地哈哈大笑起来。他完全冷静下来了。</p> 
<p>“您怎么啦，公爵，难道是医生不成？”他尽可能快活和浑朴地大声说，“甚至都吓了我一跳；纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜，可以向您介绍，这是位极为难能可贵的人物，虽然我自己也只是早晨才认识他的。”</p> 
<p>纳斯塔西砸·费利帕夫娜疑惑不解地望着公爵。</p> 
<p>“公爵？他是公爵？您倒想想，我刚才在前厅把他当作仆人，还打发他来报告！哈一哈一哈！”</p> 
<p>“不要紧，不要紧！”费尔迪先科应声说，一边急忙走近来，看到大家笑了起来而兴致勃勃，“不要紧： ｓｅ ｎｏｎ ｅ ｖｅｒｏ＊……”</p> 
<p>“还差点骂了您，公爵。请原谅。费尔迪先科，在这样的时刻，您怎么在这里？我以为，起码不会遇见您。他是什么人？哪个公爵？梅什金？”她重问着加尼亚，而此时他虽已介绍了公爵，却仍然抓着他的肩膀。</p> 
<p>“我们的房客，”加尼亚重复说。</p> 
<p>显然，公爵被当作某种稀罕的（也是适于使大家摆脱虚伪局面的）东西来介绍的，并差不多是把他硬塞给纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的；公爵甚至清楚地听到“白痴”这个字眼，好像是费尔迪先科在他背后向纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜解释时低声说的。</p> 
<p>“请告诉我，我刚才这么该死……把您弄锗了，您为什么不纠正我？”纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜一边用毫不客气的方式从头到脚打量着公爵，一边继续问道。她迫不及待地等着回答，似乎完全确信，回答一定是愚不可及，不会不引人发笑。</p> 
<p>“这么突然地看见您，我十分惊讶……”公爵刚开始喃喃着说。</p> 
<p>“您怎么知道这是我？您过去在什么地方见过我吗？这是怎么回事，真的，我好像在哪儿见过他？请问，为什么您刚才呆呆地站在那里？我身上有什么能让人发呆的？”</p> 
<p>“说呀，说呀！”费尔迪先科继续做着鬼脸说，“倒是说呀！噢，上帝啊，对这样的问题，假如是我，可以说出多少名堂来啊！倒是说呀……要不说呀，公爵，您可真是傻瓜了！”</p> 
<p>＊意大利语：即使是不对。</p> 
<p>“换了是您，我也能说出许多活来，”公爵朝费尔迪先科笑了起来，“刚才您的照片使我大为惊叹，”他对纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜继续说着，“后来我跟叶潘钦家的人也谈起过您……而清晨，还是抵达彼得堡前，在铁路上，帕尔芬·罗戈任对我讲了许多关宁您的事……就在我为您开门的那一刻，我也还在想到您，可突然您就在这里。”</p> 
<p>“您怎么知道，这就是我？”</p> 
<p>“根据照片……”</p> 
<p>“还有呢？”</p> 
<p>“还因为，我想象中的您正是这样的……我也仿佛在那儿见过您。”</p> 
<p>“在哪儿？在哪儿？”</p> 
<p>“我真的像在什么地方看见过您的眼睛……但这是不可能的！我这是这么觉得……我从来也没有来过这里。也许，是在梦中……”</p> 
<p>“真有您的，公爵！”费尔迪先科叫了起来，“我收回自己的话，ｓｅｎｏｏ；ｖｅｒ０。不过……不过，他说这些可全是因为天真单纯！”他惋惜地补了这么一句。</p> 
<p>公爵说这几句话声音很不平静，时断时续，还频频换一口气。一切都显露出他内心异常激动。纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜好奇地望着他，但已经不再笑了。就在此时，从紧紧围住公爵和纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的人群后面传来了一个新的大大咧咧的声音，可以说，这声音在人群中开出一条道来，将他们分成两半。在纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜面前站着一家之长伊沃尔金将军。他穿着燕尾服和干净的胸衣，小胡子还抹上染须剂……</p> 
<p>这可是加尼亚已经不能容忍的了。</p> 
<p>他自尊、爱虚荣到疑神疑鬼的地步，到抑郁寡欢的状态；在这两个月中他一直寻求着可以使他体面地立足和使他显得高贵的一个支点；他感觉到在所选择的道路上他尚是个新手，大概难以坚持下去；绝望的心境中他终于发现在称王称霸的自己家里恣肆骄横，但却不敢在纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜面前来这一套，因为直到目前这一刻她仍使他莫名其妙并毫不留情地对他占着上风；照纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的说法，他是个“迫不及待的穷光蛋”，这一点已经有人传话给他了；他千赌咒万发誓往后要她抵偿这一切，与此同时，有时他又天真地暗自幻想着能把各方拢到一起，使对立者和解，--而现在，他还得喝下这杯浓烈的苦酒，主要是在这种时刻！对于一个爱虚荣的人来说，有一种未曾料到，但却是最可怕的折磨--在自己家里为自己的亲人感到脸红的痛苦落到了他的身上，在这瞬间加尼亚的头脑中闪过这样的念头：“补偿本身到底是否抵得了这一切！”</p> 
<p>就在此刻发生了这两个月中只是夜里做恶梦所梦见的事，吓得他浑身透凉，羞得他满身灼热：终于他父亲跟纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜进行了家庭的会面。有时他招惹和刺激自己，试着去想象婚礼仪式上将军的模样，但是总是不能把这幅令人难受的景象想到底，便赶快抛开它。也许，他过分夸大了这种不快，但是爱虚荣的人却总是这样的。在这两个月中他来得及反复多想和作出决定，他向自己许下诺言，无论如何怎么也得约束住自己父亲，哪怕是一段时间让他别出头露面，如果不可能的话，甚至离开彼得堡，不管母亲同意还是不同意那样做。１０分钟前，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜走进来的时候，他是那么震惊、那么愕然，竟完全忘掉了阿尔达利翁·亚历山德罗维奇有可能在吵嘴时出现，也就没做任何安排。这下将军就出现在这里，在众人面前，而且还郑重其事地做了准备，穿了燕尾服，并且正是在纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜“只想寻找机会对他和他的家人大加奚落嘲笑”的时候。（他对此确信无疑。）再说，实际上她此刻来访若不是这个目的，那又是什么意思呢？她来是跟他母亲和妹妹亲近友好还是要在他家中对他们羞辱一番？但是根据双方形成时局面来看，已经不必怀疑：他的母亲和妹妹如遭人唾弃一般坐在一旁，而纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜甚至好像忘记了，她们跟她是在一个房间里……既然她是这样举止，那么；她当然是有自己的目的！</p> 
<p>费尔迪先科扶住将军，把他带到眼前。</p> 
<p>“阿尔达利翁·亚历山德罗维奇·伊沃尔金，”微笑躬身的将军庄重地说，“一个不幸的老兵和一家之长，这个家不胜荣幸的是有望纳入这么一位美妙的。……”</p> 
<p>他没有说完，费尔迪先科很快地从后面给他端上一把椅子，将军在午餐后这一刻站着有点腿脚发软，因此扑通一声或者最好是说倒到椅子上；不过这不会使他感到不好意思，他就对着纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜坐好了，用一种可爱的姿态从容而动人地把她的纤指贴近自己嘴边。一般来说要使将军感到困窘是相当困难的。他的外表，除了有点不修边幅，还是相当体面的，这一点他自己也知道得很清楚，过去他也常有机会出入高贵的上流社会，他完全被排除在外总共不过是两三年前的事。从那时起他就不加约束地过分沉溺于自己的某些爱好，但是挥洒自如，令人好感的风度在他身上保留至今，纳斯塔西娜·赞利帕夫娜似乎很高兴阿尔达利翁·亚历山德罗维奇的出现，对于他，当然她过去就有所闻。</p> 
<p>“我听说，我的儿子……”阿尔达利翁·亚历山德罗维奇本已开始说。</p> 
<p>“是啊，您的儿子！您也挺好呀，可尊敬的爸爸！为什么在我那儿从来也见不到您呀？怎么啦，是您自己躲起来的，还是儿子把您藏起来了？您倒是可以到我这儿来的，不会损害谁的名誉的。”</p> 
<p>“十九世纪的孩子和他们的父母……”将军又开始说。</p> 
<p>“纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜，请放开阿尔达利翁·亚历山德罗维奇一会儿，有人找他，”尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜大声说。</p> 
<p>“放开他！哪能呢，我听说过许多许多关于他的事，早就想见到他了！再说他又会有什么事？他不是退伍了吗？您别留下我，将军，您不定开吧？”</p> 
<p>“我向您保证，他自己会到您那儿去的，但现在他需要休息。”</p> 
<p>“阿尔达利翁·亚历山德罗维奇，他们说，您需要休息！”纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜做着不满和厌恶的鬼脸嚷道，犹如被夺去了玩具的轻桃的傻丫头。将军则偏偏还起劲地把自己的处境弄得更糟糕。</p> 
<p>“我的朋友！我的朋友！”他郑重其事地转向妻子，把手放到心口，含着责备说。</p> 
<p>“妈妈，”您不从这儿走开吗？”瓦里娅大声问。</p> 
<p>“不，瓦里娅，我要坐到底。”</p> 
<p>纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜不会没有听到这一同一答，但是她似乎因此而更加快活。她马上又向将军抛出一连串问题，而过了５分钟将军已处于最昂扬的情绪之中，在在场人的一片笑声中夸夸其谈着。</p> 
<p>科利亚拽了一下公爵的后襟。</p> 
<p>“您怎么也得想个法几把他带走！不成吗？请带开他吧！”可怜的男孩眼睛上甚至闪动着恼愤的热泪。“嘿，这该诅咒的加尼卡！”他暗自补了一句。</p> 
<p>“我过去跟伊万·费奥多罗维奇·叶潘钦确实很有交情，”将军对纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的问题兴致勃勃地回答着，“我，他以及已故的列夫·尼古拉耶维奇·梅什金公爵（２０年离别后我今天拥抱了他的儿子），我们三人可以说是形影不离的骑马闲游的伙伴：阿托斯、波尔托斯和阿拉米斯＊。可是，唉，一个已经进了坟墓，他是被诬蔑和子弹害死的，另一个就在您面前，还在跟诬蔑和子弹作斗争……”</p> 
<p>＊此系法国作家大仲马所者《三个人枪手》中的主人公。</p> 
<p>“跟子弹！”纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜喊了起来。</p> 
<p>“它们在这里，在我胸膛里，是在卡尔斯城下得的，天气不好时我就会感觉到它们。所有其它方面，我过着哲学家般的生活，走走，敬散步，像个辞职退隐的布尔乔亚那样在我去的咖啡馆下棋，看《Ｉｎｄｅｐｅｎｄａｎｃｃ》＊。但是，跟我们的波尔托斯，即叶潘钦，自从前年铁路上为了一条哈巴狗的事，我就彻底与他拉倒了。”</p> 
<p>“为了一条哈巴狗？这是怎么回事？”纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜特别好奇地问，“这条狗是怎么回事？让我想想，是在铁路上呀！……”她仿佛在想什么。</p> 
<p>“嗬，那是件无聊的事，不值得再提它：是因为别洛孔斯卡娅公爵夫人的家庭女教师施密特夫人，但是……不值得再重提了。”</p> 
<p>“您可一定要讲！”纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜快活地嚷着。</p> 
<p>“我也还没有听说过！”费尔迪先科说，“Ｃｅｓｔ ｄｕｎｏｕｖｅａｕ＊＊”</p> 
<p>“阿尔达利翁·亚历山德罗维奇！”又响起了尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜央求的声音。</p> 
<p>“爸爸，在找您呢！”科利亚喊道。</p> 
<p>“真是件无聊事，我三言两语讲一下，”将军洋洋得意地开始说，“两年前，对，差不多就在一条新的什么铁路线开辟后不久，我（已经穿着便装大衣）忙着办理对我来说非常重要的移交职务方面的事，买了一等车厢的票，走了进去，坐着抽烟，就是说我继续抽着烟，在此前就已经开始抽了。单间里就我一人。既不禁止抽烟，但也不允许；通常就算是半许可吧；当然还得看是谁。窗子拉开着。就在汽笛鸣响前，突然两位太太带着一只哈巴狗正对着我安顿下来；她们迟到了，一位雍容华贵打扮得非常漂亮，穿的是浅蓝色衣裙；另一位比较朴素，穿着带披肩的黑色绸衣。她们长得都本错，看起人来很傲慢，说的是英国话。我当然不当一回事；抽着烟。也就是说，我曾经想到过，但是，我却继续抽烟，因为窗子开着，就朝着窗外抽。哈巴狗在穿浅蓝色衣裙的小姐的膝盖上静卧着，它很小，就我拳头这么大，黑体白爪，倒是很少见的，项目是银制的，上面还有铭文。我没有理会。只不过我觉察到，女士们好像在生气，自然是因为我抽雪茄。一个戴着单目眼镜盯着我，眼镜框还是玳瑁做的，我依然无动于衷：因为他们什么也没说呀！可她们终究是有人的舌头的呀，如果说了，提醒了，请求了，就另当别论！可是她们却闭口不言……突然。我要告诉你们，没有一点提醒，就是说没有一丝表示、的的确确完全像发疯似的，那个穿浅蓝色衣裙的小姐从我手中夺过雪茄，就扔到窗外去了。列车在奔驰。我像个呆子似的望着她。这女人真粗野、真是个野蛮的女人，的的确确完全处于狂野的状态；不过，这是个粗壮的女人，肥胖而又高大，金色的头发，脸色徘红（甚至大红了），眼睛对台我熠熠闪光。我一句话也不说，非常客气，十二万分有礼，可以说是极为雍容大雅、彬彬有礼地向哈巴狗伸出两个指头，闲雅斯文地抓起它的脖颈，紧接着我的雪茄，把它向窗外一扔！它只发出一声尖叫！火车继续奔驰着……”</p> 
<p>＊法语：《独立》。</p> 
<p>＊＊法语：这是新闻。</p> 
<p>“您可真是个恶魔！”纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜喊道，她像个小姑娘似的哈哈笑着，拍着手掌。</p> 
<p>“妙极了，妙极了！”费尔迪先科喊着。将军的出现本来也令普季岑感到不快，现在他也笑了一下，甚至连科利亚也笑起来了，也喊了一声：“妙极了！”</p> 
<p>“而且我是对的，对的，加倍地对！”洋洋得意的将军热情洋溢地说，“因为，既然车厢里禁止抽烟，那么更不用说带狗了。”</p> 
<p>“棒极了，爸爸。”科利亚激昂地喊着，“太好了！换了我一定，一定也是这样干的！”</p> 
<p>“但是小姐怎么样呢？”纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜迫不及待地要问个究竟。</p> 
<p>“她？嘿，全部不愉快的根源就在她身上，”将军皱起眉头，继续说，“她一句话也不说，也没有一丝提示，就打了我一记耳光！真是个野蛮的女人；完全处于狂野的状态！”</p> 
<p>“那么您呢。”</p> 
<p>将军垂下眼睛，扬起眉毛，耸起肩膀，闭紧双唇，摊开双手，沉默了一会，突然低声说：</p> 
<p>“我很冲动。”</p> 
<p>“闹得很厉害吗？很厉害吗？”</p> 
<p>“真的，不厉害！事情闹出来了，但并不厉害。我只是挥了一下手，仅仅挥了唯一的一次。但是这一下可是自己碰上魔鬼了：穿浅蓝色的那个是英国人，是别洛孔斯卡娅公爵夫人家的家庭教师或者甚至是那一家人的什么朋友，而穿黑裙的则是别洛孔斯基家中最大的公爵小姐，她是个３５岁左右的老姑娘：众所周知，叶潘钦将军夫人与别洛孔斯基家是一种什么关系。所有的公爵小姐都晕倒了，泪水涟涟，为她们的宠物--哈巴狗服丧举哀，六位公爵小姐尖声哭喊，英国女人尖声哭叫--简直就像是到了世界未日。当然罗，我去表示悔过认错，请求原谅，写了信，但是他们既不接待我，也不收下我的信，而跟叶潘钦从此翻了脸，后来就是开除、驱逐！”</p> 
<p>“但是，请问，这到底是怎么回事？”突然纳斯塔西颀·费利帕夫娜问，“五六天前我在《１ｎｄｅｐｅｎｄａｎｃｅ》上也读到过一个这样的故事，我是经常看《１ｎｄｅｎｐｅｎｄａｎｃｅ》的。而且绝对是一样的故事！这事发生在莱茵河沿岸的铁路线上，在车厢里，牵涉到一个法国男人和一个英国女人：也是这样夺下了一枝雪茄，也是这样千条哈巴狗被抛到了窗外，最后，也是像您讲的那样结束，连衣裙也是浅蓝色的！”</p> 
<p>将军满脸啡红，科利亚也脸红了，双手夹紧脑袋；普季岑很快转过身去。只有费尔迪先科一个人仍像原来那样哈哈大笑。至于加尼亚就不用说了：他一直站在那里，强忍着无声的和难以忍受的痛苦。</p> 
<p>“请您相信，”将军喃喃说道，“我确实发生过同样的事……”</p> 
<p>“爸爸确实跟施密德大太，即别洛孔斯基家的家庭教师有过不愉快的事，”科利亚嚷了起来，“我记得。”</p> 
<p>“怎么！一模一样？在欧洲的两个地方发生同一个故事，在所有的细节上，直至浅蓝色裙子都毫厘不差。”纳斯塔西娅·赞利帕夫娜坚不让步，毫不留情，“我把《１ｎｄｅｎｅｎｄａｎｃｅ Ｂｅ１ｇｅ》派人给您送来！”</p> 
<p>“噢，但是请注意，”将军仍然坚持着，“我是两年前发生这事的……”</p> 
<p>“竟可能全是这样！”</p> 
<p>纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜如歇斯底里一般哈哈大笑起来。</p> 
<p>“爸爸，我请您出去说两句话，”加尼亚机械地抓住父亲的肩膀，用颤抖的痛苦不堪的声音说。在他的目光中充满着无限的仇恨。</p> 
<p>就在这一瞬间从外间里传来了非常响的门铃声。这样子拉铃会把门铃都扯下来的。预示着将是不同一般的来访。科利亚跑了去开门。</p>
