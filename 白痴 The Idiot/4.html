<p>Elizabetha Prokofievna sometimes informed the girls that they were a little too candid in this matter, but in spite of their outward deference to their mother these three young women, in solemn conclave, had long agreed to modify the unquestioning obedience which they had been in the habit of according to her; and Mrs. General Epanchin had judged it better to say nothing about it, though, of course, she was well aware of the fact.</p> 
<p>It is true that her nature sometimes rebelled against these dictates of reason, and that she grew yearly more capricious and impatient; but having a respectful and well-disciplined husband under her thumb at all times, she found it possible, as a rule, to empty any little accumulations of spleen upon his head, and therefore the harmony of the family was kept duly balanced, and things went as smoothly as family matters can.</p> 
<p>Mrs. Epanchin had a fair appetite herself, and generally took her share of the capital mid-day lunch which was always served for the girls, and which was nearly as good as a dinner. The young ladies used to have a cup of coffee each before this meal, at ten o'clock, while still in bed. This was a favourite and unalterable arrangement with them. At half-past twelve, the table was laid in the small dining-room, and occasionally the general himself appeared at the family gathering, if he had time.</p> 
<p>Besides tea and coffee, cheese, honey, butter, pan-cakes of various kinds (the lady of the house loved these best), cutlets, and so on, there was generally strong beef soup, and other substantial delicacies.</p> 
<p>On the particular morning on which our story has opened, the family had assembled in the dining-room, and were waiting the general's appearance, the latter having promised to come this day. If he had been one moment late, he would have been sent for at once; but he turned up punctually.</p> 
<p>As he came forward to wish his wife good-morning and kiss her hands, as his custom was, he observed something in her look which boded ill. He thought he knew the reason, and had expected it, but still, he was not altogether comfortable. His daughters advanced to kiss him, too, and though they did not look exactly angry, there was something strange in their expression as well.</p> 
<p>The general was, owing to certain circumstances, a little inclined to be too suspicious at home, and needlessly nervous; but, as an experienced father and husband, he judged it better to take measures at once to protect himself from any dangers there might be in the air.</p> 
<p>However, I hope I shall not interfere with the proper sequence of my narrative too much, if I diverge for a moment at this point, in order to explain the mutual relations between General Epanchin's family and others acting a part in this history, at the time when we take up the thread of their destiny. I have already stated that the general, though he was a man of lowly origin, and of poor education, was, for all that, an experienced and talented husband and father. Among other things, he considered it undesirable to hurry his daughters to the matrimonial altar and to worry them too much with assurances of his paternal wishes for their happiness, as is the custom among parents of many grown-up daughters. He even succeeded in ranging his wife on his side on this question, though he found the feat very difficult to accomplish, because unnatural; but the general's arguments were conclusive, and founded upon obvious facts. The general considered that the girls' taste and good sense should be allowed to develop and mature deliberately, and that the parents' duty should merely be to keep watch, in order that no strange or undesirable choice be made; but that the selection once effected, both father and mother were bound from that moment to enter heart and soul into the cause, and to see that the matter progressed without hindrance until the altar should be happily reached.</p> 
<p>Besides this, it was clear that the Epanchins' position gained each year, with geometrical accuracy, both as to financial solidity and social weight; and, therefore, the longer the girls waited, the better was their chance of making a brilliant match.</p> 
<p>But again, amidst the incontrovertible facts just recorded, one more, equally significant, rose up to confront the family; and this was, that the eldest daughter, Alexandra, had imperceptibly arrived at her twenty-fifth birthday. Almost at the same moment, Afanasy Ivanovitch Totski, a man of immense wealth, high connections, and good standing, announced his intention of marrying. Afanasy Ivanovitch was a gentleman of fifty-five years of age, artistically gifted, and of most refined tastes. He wished to marry well, and, moreover, he was a keen admirer and judge of beauty.</p> 
<p>Now, since Totski had, of late, been upon terms of great cordiality with Epanchin, which excellent relations were intensified by the fact that they were, so to speak, partners in several financial enterprises, it so happened that the former now put in a friendly request to the general for counsel with regard to the important step he meditated. Might he suggest, for instance, such a thing as a marriage between himself and one of the general's daughters?</p> 
<p>Evidently the quiet, pleasant current of the family life of the Epanchins was about to undergo a change.</p> 
<p>The undoubted beauty of the family, par excellence, was the youngest, Aglaya, as aforesaid. But Totski himself, though an egotist of the extremest type, realized that he had no chance there; Aglaya was clearly not for such as he.</p> 
<p>Perhaps the sisterly love and friendship of the three girls had more or less exaggerated Aglaya's chances of happiness. In their opinion, the latter's destiny was not merely to be very happy; she was to live in a heaven on earth. Aglaya's husband was to be a compendium of all the virtues, and of all success, not to speak of fabulous wealth. The two elder sisters had agreed that all was to be sacrificed by them, if need be, for Aglaya's sake; her dowry was to be colossal and unprecedented.</p> 
<p>The general and his wife were aware of this agreement, and, therefore, when Totski suggested himself for one of the sisters, the parents made no doubt that one of the two elder girls would probably accept the offer, since Totski would certainly make no difficulty as to dowry. The general valued the proposal very highly. He knew life, and realized what such an offer was worth.</p> 
<p>The answer of the sisters to the communication was, if not conclusive, at least consoling and hopeful. It made known that the eldest, Alexandra, would very likely be disposed to listen to a proposal.</p> 
<p>Alexandra was a good-natured girl, though she had a will of her own. She was intelligent and kind-hearted, and, if she were to marry Totski, she would make him a good wife. She did not care for a brilliant marriage; she was eminently a woman calculated to soothe and sweeten the life of any man; decidedly pretty, if not absolutely handsome. What better could Totski wish?</p> 
<p>So the matter crept slowly forward. The general and Totski had agreed to avoid any hasty and irrevocable step. Alexandra's parents had not even begun to talk to their daughters freely upon the subject, when suddenly, as it were, a dissonant chord was struck amid the harmony of the proceedings. Mrs. Epanchin began to show signs of discontent, and that was a serious matter. A certain circumstance had crept in, a disagreeable and troublesome factor, which threatened to overturn the whole business.</p> 
<p>This circumstance had come into existence eighteen years before. Close to an estate of Totski's, in one of the central provinces of Russia, there lived, at that time, a poor gentleman whose estate was of the wretchedest description. This gentleman was noted in the district for his persistent ill-fortune; his name was Barashkoff, and, as regards family and descent, he was vastly superior to Totski, but his estate was mortgaged to the last acre. One day, when he had ridden over to the town to see a creditor, the chief peasant of his village followed him shortly after, with the news that his house had been burnt down, and that his wife had perished with it, but his children were safe.</p> 
<p>Even Barashkoff, inured to the storms of evil fortune as he was, could not stand this last stroke. He went mad and died shortly after in the town hospital. His estate was sold for the creditors; and the little girls--two of them, of seven and eight years of age respectively,--were adopted by Totski, who undertook their maintenance and education in the kindness of his heart. They were brought up together with the children of his German bailiff. Very soon, however, there was only one of them left- Nastasia Philipovna--for the other little one died of whooping- cough. Totski, who was living abroad at this time, very soon forgot all about the child; but five years after, returning to Russia, it struck him that he would like to look over his estate and see how matters were going there, and, arrived at his bailiff's house, he was not long in discovering that among the children of the latter there now dwelt a most lovely little girl of twelve, sweet and intelligent, and bright, and promising to develop beauty of most unusual quality-as to which last Totski was an undoubted authority.</p> 
<p>He only stayed at his country scat a few days on this occasion, but he had time to make his arrangements. Great changes took place in the child's education; a good governess was engaged, a Swiss lady of experience and culture. For four years this lady resided in the house with little Nastia, and then the education was considered complete. The governess took her departure, and another lady came down to fetch Nastia, by Totski's instructions. The child was now transported to another of Totski's estates in a distant part of the country. Here she found a delightful little house, just built, and prepared for her reception with great care and taste; and here she took up her abode together with the lady who had accompanied her from her old home. In the house there were two experienced maids, musical instruments of all sorts, a charming "young lady's library," pictures, paint-boxes, a lap- dog, and everything to make life agreeable. Within a fortnight Totski himself arrived, and from that time he appeared to have taken a great fancy to this part of the world and came down each summer, staying two and three months at a time. So passed four years peacefully and happily, in charming surroundings.</p> 
<p>At the end of that time, and about four months after Totski's last visit (he had stayed but a fortnight on this occasion), a report reached Nastasia Philipovna that he was about to be married in St. Petersburg, to a rich, eminent, and lovely woman. The report was only partially true, the marriage project being only in an embryo condition; but a great change now came over Nastasia Philipovna. She suddenly displayed unusual decision of character; and without wasting time in thought, she left her country home and came up to St. Petersburg, straight to Totski's house, all alone.</p> 
<p>The latter, amazed at her conduct, began to express his displeasure; but he very soon became aware that he must change his voice, style, and everything else, with this young lady; the good old times were gone. An entirely new and different woman sat before him, between whom and the girl he had left in the country last July there seemed nothing in common.</p> 
<p>In the first place, this new woman understood a good deal more than was usual for young people of her age; so much indeed, that Totski could not help wondering where she had picked up her knowledge. Surely not from her "young lady's library"? It even embraced legal matters, and the "world" in general, to a considerable extent.</p> 
<p>Her character was absolutely changed. No more of the girlish alternations of timidity and petulance, the adorable naivete, the reveries, the tears, the playfulness... It was an entirely new and hitherto unknown being who now sat and laughed at him, and informed him to his face that she had never had the faintest feeling for him of any kind, except loathing and contempt-- contempt which had followed closely upon her sensations of surprise and bewilderment after her first acquaintance with him.</p> 
<p>This new woman gave him further to understand that though it was absolutely the same to her whom he married, yet she had decided to prevent this marriage--for no particular reason, but that she chose to do so, and because she wished to amuse herself at his expense for that it was "quite her turn to laugh a little now!"</p> 
<p>Such were her words--very likely she did not give her real reason for this eccentric conduct; but, at all events, that was all the explanation she deigned to offer.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, Totski thought the matter over as well as his scattered ideas would permit. His meditations lasted a fortnight, however, and at the end of that time his resolution was taken. The fact was, Totski was at that time a man of fifty years of age; his position was solid and respectable; his place in society had long been firmly fixed upon safe foundations; he loved himself, his personal comforts, and his position better than all the world, as every respectable gentleman should!</p> 
<p>At the same time his grasp of things in general soon showed Totski that he now had to deal with a being who was outside the pale of the ordinary rules of traditional behaviour, and who would not only threaten mischief but would undoubtedly carry it out, and stop for no one.</p> 
<p>There was evidently, he concluded, something at work here; some storm of the mind, some paroxysm of romantic anger, goodness knows against whom or what, some insatiable contempt--in a word, something altogether absurd and impossible, but at the same time most dangerous to be met with by any respectable person with a position in society to keep up.</p> 
<p>For a man of Totski's wealth and standing, it would, of course, have been the simplest possible matter to take steps which would rid him at once from all annoyance; while it was obviously impossible for Nastasia Philipovna to harm him in any way, either legally or by stirring up a scandal, for, in case of the latter danger, he could so easily remove her to a sphere of safety. However, these arguments would only hold good in case of Nastasia acting as others might in such an emergency. She was much more likely to overstep the bounds of reasonable conduct by some extraordinary eccentricity.</p> 
<p>Here the sound judgment of Totski stood him in good stead. He realized that Nastasia Philipovna must be well aware that she could do nothing by legal means to injure him, and that her flashing eyes betrayed some entirely different intention.</p> 
<p>Nastasia Philipovna was quite capable of ruining herself, and even of perpetrating something which would send her to Siberia, for the mere pleasure of injuring a man for whom she had developed so inhuman a sense of loathing and contempt. He had sufficient insight to understand that she valued nothing in the world--herself least of all--and he made no attempt to conceal the fact that he was a coward in some respects. For instance, if he had been told that he would be stabbed at the altar, or publicly insulted, he would undoubtedly have been frightened; but not so much at the idea of being murdered, or wounded, or insulted, as at the thought that if such things were to happen he would be made to look ridiculous in the eyes of society.</p> 
<p>He knew well that Nastasia thoroughly understood him and where to wound him and how, and therefore, as the marriage was still only in embryo, Totski decided to conciliate her by giving it up. His decision was strengthened by the fact that Nastasia Philipovna had curiously altered of late. It would be difficult to conceive how different she was physically, at the present time, to the girl of a few years ago. She was pretty then . . . but now! . . . Totski laughed angrily when he thought how short-sighted he had been. In days gone by he remembered how he had looked at her beautiful eyes, how even then he had marvelled at their dark mysterious depths, and at their wondering gaze which seemed to seek an answer to some unknown riddle. Her complexion also had altered. She was now exceedingly pale, but, curiously, this change only made her more beautiful. Like most men of the world, Totski had rather despised such a cheaply-bought conquest, but of late years he had begun to think differently about it. It had struck him as long ago as last spring that he ought to be finding a good match for Nastasia; for instance, some respectable and reasonable young fellow serving in a government office in another part of the country. How maliciously Nastasia laughed at the idea of such a thing, now!</p> 
<p>However, it appeared to Totski that he might make use of her in another way; and he determined to establish her in St. Petersburg, surrounding her with all the comforts and luxuries that his wealth could command. In this way he might gain glory in certain circles.</p> 
<p>Five years of this Petersburg life went by, and, of course, during that time a great deal happened. Totski's position was very uncomfortable; having "funked" once, he could not totally regain his ease. He was afraid, he did not know why, but he was simply afraid of Nastasia Philipovna. For the first two years or so he had suspected that she wished to marry him herself, and that only her vanity prevented her telling him so. He thought that she wanted him to approach her with a humble proposal from his own side, But to his great, and not entirely pleasurable amazement, he discovered that this was by no means the case, and that were he to offer himself he would be refused. He could not understand such a state of things, and was obliged to conclude that it was pride, the pride of an injured and imaginative woman, which had gone to such lengths that it preferred to sit and nurse its contempt and hatred in solitude rather than mount to heights of hitherto unattainable splendour. To make matters worse, she was quite impervious to mercenary considerations, and could not be bribed in any way.</p> 
<p>Finally, Totski took cunning means to try to break his chains and be free. He tried to tempt her in various ways to lose her heart; he invited princes, hussars, secretaries of embassies, poets, novelists, even Socialists, to see her; but not one of them all made the faintest impression upon Nastasia. It was as though she had a pebble in place of a heart, as though her feelings and affections were dried up and withered for ever.</p> 
<p>She lived almost entirely alone; she read, she studied, she loved music. Her principal acquaintances were poor women of various grades, a couple of actresses, and the family of a poor schoolteacher. Among these people she was much beloved.</p>  
<p>When Totski had approached the general with his request for friendly counsel as to a marriage with one of his daughters, he had made a full and candid confession. He had said that he intended to stop at no means to obtain his freedom; even if Nastasia were to promise to leave him entirely alone in future, he would not (he said) believe and trust her; words were not enough for him; he must have solid guarantees of some sort. So he and the general determined to try what an attempt to appeal to her heart would effect. Having arrived at Nastasia's house one day, with Epanchin, Totski immediately began to speak of the intolerable torment of his position. He admitted that he was to blame for all, but candidly confessed that he could not bring himself to feel any remorse for his original guilt towards herself, because he was a man of sensual passions which were inborn and ineradicable, and that he had no power over himself in this respect; but that he wished, seriously, to marry at last, and that the whole fate of the most desirable social union which he contemplated, was in her hands; in a word, he confided his all to her generosity of heart.</p> 
<p>General Epanchin took up his part and spoke in the character of father of a family; he spoke sensibly, and without wasting words over any attempt at sentimentality, he merely recorded his full admission of her right to be the arbiter of Totski's destiny at this moment. He then pointed out that the fate of his daughter, and very likely of both his other daughters, now hung upon her reply.</p> 
<p>To Nastasia's question as to what they wished her to do, Totski confessed that he had been so frightened by her, five years ago, that he could never now be entirely comfortable until she herself married. He immediately added that such a suggestion from him would, of course, be absurd, unless accompanied by remarks of a more pointed nature. He very well knew, he said, that a certain young gentleman of good family, namely, Gavrila Ardalionovitch Ivolgin, with whom she was acquainted, and whom she received at her house, had long loved her passionately, and would give his life for some response from her. The young fellow had confessed this love of his to him (Totski) and had also admitted it in the hearing of his benefactor, General Epanchin. Lastly, he could not help being of opinion that Nastasia must be aware of Gania's love for her, and if he (Totski) mistook not, she had looked with some favour upon it, being often lonely, and rather tired of her present life. Having remarked how difficult it was for him, of all people, to speak to her of these matters, Totski concluded by saying that he trusted Nastasia Philipovna would not look with contempt upon him if he now expressed his sincere desire to guarantee her future by a gift of seventy-five thousand roubles. He added that the sum would have been left her all the same in his will, and that therefore she must not consider the gift as in any way an indemnification to her for anything, but that there was no reason, after all, why a man should not be allowed to entertain a natural desire to lighten his conscience, etc., etc.; in fact, all that would naturally be said under the circumstances. Totski was very eloquent all through, and, in conclusion, just touched on the fact that not a soul in the world, not even General Epanchin, had ever heard a word about the above seventy-five thousand roubles, and that this was the first time he had ever given expression to his intentions in respect to them.</p> 
<p>Nastasia Philipovna's reply to this long rigmarole astonished both the friends considerably.</p> 
<p>Not only was there no trace of her former irony, of her old hatred and enmity, and of that dreadful laughter, the very recollection of which sent a cold chill down Totski's back to this very day; but she seemed charmed and really glad to have the opportunity of talking seriously with him for once in a way. She confessed that she had long wished to have a frank and free conversation and to ask for friendly advice, but that pride had hitherto prevented her; now, however, that the ice was broken, nothing could be more welcome to her than this opportunity.</p> 
<p>First, with a sad smile, and then with a twinkle of merriment in her eyes, she admitted that such a storm as that of five years ago was now quite out of the question. She said that she had long since changed her views of things, and recognized that facts must be taken into consideration in spite of the feelings of the heart. What was done was done and ended, and she could not understand why Totski should still feel alarmed.</p> 
<p>She next turned to General Epanchin and observed, most courteously, that she had long since known of his daughters, and that she had heard none but good report; that she had learned to think of them with deep and sincere respect. The idea alone that she could in any way serve them, would be to her both a pride and a source of real happiness.</p> 
<p>It was true that she was lonely in her present life; Totski had judged her thoughts aright. She longed to rise, if not to love, at least to family life and new hopes and objects, but as to Gavrila Ardalionovitch, she could not as yet say much. She thought it must be the case that he loved her; she felt that she too might learn to love him, if she could be sure of the firmness of his attachment to herself; but he was very young, and it was a difficult question to decide. What she specially liked about him was that he worked, and supported his family by his toil.</p> 
<p>She had heard that he was proud and ambitious; she had heard much that was interesting of his mother and sister, she had heard of them from Mr. Ptitsin, and would much like to make their acquaintance, but--another question!--would they like to receive her into their house? At all events, though she did not reject the idea of this marriage, she desired not to be hurried. As for the seventy-five thousand roubles, Mr. Totski need not have found any difficulty or awkwardness about the matter; she quite understood the value of money, and would, of course, accept the gift. She thanked him for his delicacy, however, but saw no reason why Gavrila Ardalionovitch should not know about it.</p> 
<p>She would not marry the latter, she said, until she felt persuaded that neither on his part nor on the part of his family did there exist any sort of concealed suspicions as to herself. She did not intend to ask forgiveness for anything in the past, which fact she desired to be known. She did not consider herself to blame for anything that had happened in former years, and she thought that Gavrila Ardalionovitch should be informed as to the relations which had existed between herself and Totski during the last five years. If she accepted this money it was not to be considered as indemnification for her misfortune as a young girl, which had not been in any degree her own fault, but merely as compensation for her ruined life.</p> 
<p>She became so excited and agitated during all these explanations and confessions that General Epanchin was highly gratified, and considered the matter satisfactorily arranged once for all. But the once bitten Totski was twice shy, and looked for hidden snakes among the flowers. However, the special point to which the two friends particularly trusted to bring about their object (namely, Gania's attractiveness for Nastasia Philipovna), stood out more and more prominently; the pourparlers had commenced, and gradually even Totski began to believe in the possibility of success.</p> 
<p>Before long Nastasia and Gania had talked the matter over. Very little was said--her modesty seemed to suffer under the infliction of discussing such a question. But she recognized his love, on the understanding that she bound herself to nothing whatever, and that she reserved the right to say "no" up to the very hour of the marriage ceremony. Gania was to have the same right of refusal at the last moment.</p> 
<p>It soon became clear to Gania, after scenes of wrath and quarrellings at the domestic hearth, that his family were seriously opposed to the match, and that Nastasia was aware of this fact was equally evident. She said nothing about it, though he daily expected her to do so.</p> 
<p>There were several rumours afloat, before long, which upset Totski's equanimity a good deal, but we will not now stop to describe them; merely mentioning an instance or two. One was that Nastasia had entered into close and secret relations with the Epanchin girls--a most unlikely rumour; another was that Nastasia had long satisfied herself of the fact that Gania was merely marrying her for money, and that his nature was gloomy and greedy, impatient and selfish, to an extraordinary degree; and that although he had been keen enough in his desire to achieve a conquest before, yet since the two friends had agreed to exploit his passion for their own purposes, it was clear enough that he had begun to consider the whole thing a nuisance and a nightmare.</p> 
<p>In his heart passion and hate seemed to hold divided sway, and although he had at last given his consent to marry the woman (as he said), under the stress of circumstances, yet he promised himself that he would "take it out of her," after marriage.</p> 
<p>Nastasia seemed to Totski to have divined all this, and to be preparing something on her own account, which frightened him to such an extent that he did not dare communicate his views even to the general. But at times he would pluck up his courage and be full of hope and good spirits again, acting, in fact, as weak men do act in such circumstances.</p> 
<p>However, both the friends felt that the thing looked rosy indeed when one day Nastasia informed them that she would give her final answer on the evening of her birthday, which anniversary was due in a very short time.</p> 
<p>A strange rumour began to circulate, meanwhile; no less than that the respectable and highly respected General Epanchin was himself so fascinated by Nastasia Philipovna that his feeling for her amounted almost to passion. What he thought to gain by Gania's marriage to the girl it was difficult to imagine. Possibly he counted on Gania's complaisance; for Totski had long suspected that there existed some secret understanding between the general and his secretary. At all events the fact was known that he had prepared a magnificent present of pearls for Nastasia's birthday, and that he was looking forward to the occasion when he should present his gift with the greatest excitement and impatience. The day before her birthday he was in a fever of agitation.</p> 
<p>Mrs. Epanchin, long accustomed to her husband's infidelities, had heard of the pearls, and the rumour excited her liveliest curiosity and interest. The general remarked her suspicions, and felt that a grand explanation must shortly take place--which fact alarmed him much.</p> 
<p>This is the reason why he was so unwilling to take lunch (on the morning upon which we took up this narrative) with the rest of his family. Before the prince's arrival he had made up his mind to plead business, and "cut" the meal; which simply meant running away.</p> 
<p>He was particularly anxious that this one day should be passed-- especially the evening--without unpleasantness between himself and his family; and just at the right moment the prince turned up--"as though Heaven had sent him on purpose," said the general to himself, as he left the study to seek out the wife of his bosom.</p>  
<p>其实，将军夫人自己也没有失去食欲，通常在１２点半和女儿们一起共进几乎像聚餐一样的丰盛的早餐。再早些，１０点正的时候，小姐们刚醒来，在被窝里要喝上一杯咖啡。她们喜欢这样，便形成了不可更改的规矩。１２点半在靠近妈妈房间的小餐厅里开饭。如果时间许可的话，将军本人有时也会来参加。这一亲密的家庭早餐除了茶、咖啡、乳酪、蜂蜜、黄油，将军夫人自己爱吃的一种特别的油炸饼、肉丸和其它食物以外，甚至还端上了浓浓的热荤汤。在我们的故事开始的那个早晨，全家正聚集在餐厅，等待答应在１２点半前来的将军，要是他迟到那怕１分钟，便会立即派人去请，但是将军准时来到了。他走到跟前问候了夫人，吻了一下她的手，发现今天夫人的脸上有某种非常特别的神色。虽然还在昨天晚上他就预感到，因为一桩“轶事”（这是他自己的习惯表达），今天一定会是这样，因此昨天睡觉时就惶惶不安，但现在仍然很畏怯。女儿们走到眼前吻了他，虽然不是对他生气，可终究也似乎有什么特别的神态。确实，由于某些情况，将军过分疑虑了，但因为他是有经验的和精明的父亲和丈夫，所以马上就采取自己的手段。</p> 
<p>如果我们在这里停一下，惜助于某些说明来直截了当和准确无误地确定我们故事开端时叶潘钦将军一家所处的关系和情况，大概不会有损于弄清楚我们的故事。我们刚才已经说过了，将军本人虽然没有受过很多教育，相反，正如他自己说自己那样，是个“自学出来的人”，但却是个有经验的丈夫和精明的父亲。顺便说，他采取不急于把女儿嫁出去的原则，也就是“不使她们厌烦”，也不以过分操心她们幸福的父母之爱使她们不安，甚至在有好几个成年女儿的最明智的家庭里也常常发生这种由不得自己，听其自然的情况。他甚至做到了使叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜也接受了自己的原则，虽然这种事总的来说是很困难的，之所以困难，是因为它不自然，可是将军的论据建立在显而易见的事实上，非常有力。再说，未婚的姑娘们被容许享有自己的意志和自己的决定后，自然地，最终将不得不自己去拿主意，那时事情就会红火起来，因为她们愿意去做，就会把任性和过分的挑剔搁在一旁，剩下来父母该做的便只是十分留神和尽量不被觉察地观察，以免做出什么奇怪的选择或者不自然的偏差，然后抓住适当的时机，一下子全力相助，并施加全部影响使事情顺利发展，最后，比如说，光是他们的财产和社会地位每年成几何级数增长这一点，就表明，时光越是流逝，女儿们也就越有利，即使作为未婚妻也是这样。但是在所有这些毋庸反驳的事实中也还有一个事实：大女儿亚历山德拉突然间、几乎完全出人意料地（常常总会有这样的事）过了２５岁。几乎就在这个时候阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇·托茨基这位有着高层关系，财富惊人的上流社会名人又流露出自己想要结婚的夙愿，此人５５岁，有着优美的性格，异常高雅的情趣。他想结一门好亲，是个不寻常的美的鉴赏家，因为从某个时候起他与叶潘钦将军已有了非同一般的情谊，特别是彼此加入了一些金融企业更加强了这种交情，所以他告诉将军，这么说吧，请求得到友好的忠告和指教：他有意与将军的一位女儿结婚，这种打算是否有可能实现？于是在叶潘钦将军宁静美满，优游舒缓的家庭生活中发生了明显的急剧转折。</p> 
<p>家里无可争议的美人，上面已经说过，是最小的阿格拉娅。但是，连托茨基自己，这个异常自私的人，也明白，他不应该找这一个，阿格拉娅不是为他而生的，也许，出于多少有些盲目的钟爱和过分热烈的情谊，姐姐们把妹妹的婚嫁看得过高了。但他们之间的最真诚的态度事先已经确定了阿格拉娅的命运，这不是一般的命运，而是尽可能要成为人世间天堂的理想。阿格拉娅未来的丈夫应该是个完美无暇、万事亨通的人，财富就不用说了。两个姐姐还似乎没有特别多费口舌就决定；为了阿格拉娅的利益，如果必要的话，她们可以作出牺牲，并且准备给阿格拉娅一笔数目巨大、非同小可的陪嫁。父母知道两个姐姐的这一协定，因此，当托茨基请求商量这件事的时候，他们之间几乎没有丝毫怀疑，两个姐姐中的一个大概不会拒绝满足他们的愿望，况且阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇对于陪嫁是不会为难的，将军本人以其独有的精于世故立即就对托茨基的提议予以极高的评价。因为托茨基本人由于某些特殊的情况暂时对自己的步骤还采取十分谨慎的态度，还只是试探这事的可能与否，因此父母也就只是表面上建议女儿们考虑这－－还很遥远的设想。从女儿那里得到的回答，虽然也不很明确，但至少是令人慰藉的。大女儿亚历山德拉大概是不会拒绝的。这姑娘虽然性格坚强，但很善良，理智，十分随和。她甚至会乐意嫁给托茨基，而且，如果她同意婚事，就会诚实地去履行，她不喜欢炫耀，不仅没有带来过麻烦和急剧转折的危险，而且还能妥善安排好生活。使日子过得安逸宁静。她长得很好，虽然不很动人，但对托茨基来说还会有更好的吗？</p> 
<p>然而，事情的进展依然是试探性的，在托茨基和将军之间彼此友好地商定，时机成熟以前避免采取一切正式的，无可挽回的步骤，甚至父母也还没有完全开诚布公地跟女儿们谈这件事。于是家里似乎就蒙上了不和谐的气氛：家里的母亲叶潘钦将军夫人不知为什么变得不顺心起来，而这一点很重要。这里存在一个妨碍一切的情况，有一件难办和麻烦的事情，整个局面便因此而无可挽回地受到了破坏。</p> 
<p>这一难办和麻烦的“事情”（托茨基自己这么称）还是在很久以前，大约１８年前开始的。阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇在俄罗斯的一个中部省份有好几处最富饶的田产，在其中一处旁边则有个穷困的小地主过着清苦贫寒的生活，此人因屡屡遭逢可笑的倒霉事而惹人关注。他是个退役军官，有着很好的贵族姓氏，在这一点上甚至比托茨基还高贵些，此人叫费利普·亚历山德罗维奇·巴拉什科夫，他一身债务，典当光家产，在一番几乎跟农夫一样的苦役般的劳作后，终于好歹安置了一份勉强能过日子的小小家业，这一微小的成功便使他异常振奋。他满怀希望，精神星烁，容光焕发，离开了村庄去县城几天，想见见一位主要的债主，可能的话，跟他彻底谈妥，他来到城里第三天，他的村长带着烧伤的脸，烧焦的胡子骑马赶来向他报告，“领地烧掉了，”昨天中午，“夫人也烧死了，而女孩还活着。”即使是已经习惯于被“命运揍得青一块紫一块”的巴拉什科夫也难以承受这样的意外变故，他疯了，过一个月便死于热病。焚毁的庄园连同沦为乞丐的农民都变卖抵偿债务，巴拉什科夫的孩子，两个小女孩，６岁和７岁，阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇·托茨基出于慷慨而收着并给以教育，她们开始跟阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇的管家的孩子们一起受教育。管家是个退职的官吏，家口颇多，还是个德国人，不久便只剩下一个小女孩纳斯佳，小的那个死于百日咳。而托茨基住在国外，很快便把她们俩忘得一干二净。过了５年，有一次阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇路过那里，忽然想起要看看自己的庄园，不料在自己的乡间房子里，在自己的德国人家里，却发现有一个非常好看的孩子，这个１２岁左右的小女孩，活泼、可爱、聪颖，定会出落成非凡的美人。在这方面阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇是个准确无误的行家；这次他在庄园只住了几天，但是却做出了安排，于是女孩的教育便发生了重要的变化，请了一位令人敬重的上了年纪的家庭女教师，她是瑞士人，有学问，除了法语还教过各种学科，在对少女进行高等教育方面很有经验。她住到了乡间屋子里，于是小纳斯塔西娅的教育便有了非同一般的改观。过了整整四年这种教育结束了，女教师走了，一位太太来接纳斯佳，她也是一个女地主，也是托茨基先生庄园的邻居，但是在另一个遥远的省份。根据阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇的指示和全权委托，她带走了纳斯佳，在这个不大的庄园里也有一座虽然不大，但是刚盖好的木屋，它拾缀得特别雅致，而这个小村庄仿佛故意似的叫做快乐村。女地主把纳斯佳直接带到这座幽静的小屋里，固为她自己，一个没有孩子的漏妇，就住在总共才几俄里远的地方，因此也搬来与纳斯佳同住。纳斯佳身边还有一个管家老太婆和年轻有经验的家庭女教师。屋子里也有各种乐器，姑娘读的精美图书，画、版画、铅笔、画笔、颜料，一条令人惊叹的小狗，两个星期后阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇本人也光临了……从那时起他似乎特别眷恋这座僻静的草原上的小村子，每年夏天都要来，作客两个甚至三个月，就这样过了相当长的时间，约四年左右，安逸和幸福，有情趣的风雅。</p> 
<p>有一次发生了一件事，仿佛是在冬初，是在阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇夏临之后四个月。这一次他只住了两个星期，却传出了风声，或者，最好是说，不知怎么地流言蜚语传到了纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜这里，说阿法纳西·伊凡诺维奇在彼得堡将跟一位名门闺秀、富家小姐结婚，总之，是在攀一门声名显赫，璀璨光耀的婚事，后来表明这一传闻在细节上并不全都准确。这门婚事当时还只是在拟议之中，一切还很暧昧，但从这时起在纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的命运中终究发生了异常大的转折。她突然表现出不同寻常的决心，显示出最出乎意料的性格，她未多加考虑，就抛弃了自己的乡村小屋，突然只身来到彼得堡，径直去找托茨基。后者大为惊讶，刚开始说话，却几乎从讲第一句话时起就忽然发觉，应该完全改变迄今为止运用得非常成功的表达技巧、嗓子声调、令人愉快和颇具雅兴的过去的话题，还有逻辑——一切的一切！他面前坐着的完全是一个女人，丝毫也不像他至今所了解的、七月间在快乐村才与他分手的那个女人。</p> 
<p>这个以新面目出现的女人，原来，第一，知道和懂得的东西非常之多，多得足以让人深感诧异，她从哪儿获得这些知识，形成这样确切的概念。莫非是从少女的藏书中得来的？此外，她甚至在法律方面也懂得非常之多，纵然对整个世界还没有真正了解，但至少对世上某些事情的来肮去脉知道得一清二楚；第二，她已经完全不是过去那种性格的人，也就是不再羞怯，不再像贵族女子学校里的学生那样捉摸不定，有时是独具风韵的天真活泼，有时郁郁寡欢和想人非非，有时大惊小怪和疑意重重、有时位涕涟涟和心烦意乱－－不，此刻在他面前哈哈大笑并用刻薄恶毒的冷嘲热讽来挖苦他的是个非同一般、出入不意的人物。她直截了当向他申明，在她心里除了对他的深深蔑视，从来也没有别的感情，而且在发生第一次令她惊愕的事后立即就产生的，这种蔑视达到了让人恶心的地步。这个新生的女人宣称，无论他跟谁，即使是马上结婚，她也完全无所谓，但是，她来这里就是不许他结这门亲，是出于愤恨而不允许，唯一的原因便是她想这样做，因而也就该这样，——“嘿，那怕只是为了我能畅快地嘲笑你一通，因为现在我终于也想笑了。”</p> 
<p>至少她是这样说的，她头脑里想到的一切，大概，她没有全说出来。但是在这个新的纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜哈哈大笑的时候，阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇暗自斟酌着这件事，尽可能要把自己多少有点散乱的思绪理出个眉目来。这种思量持续了不少时间，他深谋远虑几乎两个星期要最后做出决定，而过了两个星期他做出了决定。关键在于阿法纳西· 伊万诺维奇那时已经将近５０岁了，是个有着高贵的声望和稳固的身价的人。他在上流社会和社会上的地位很久很久前就在牢固的基础上确立起来了。正像一个上流社会的高等人理该那样，在世上他最喜欢和珍重的是自己：自己的安宁和舒适。他一生确定和形成的这般美好的生活形式是不容许有丝毫的破坏、些微的动摇的。从另一方面来说，对于事物的经验和深邃的洞察力又很快地、非常准确地告诉他，现在与之打交道的完全是个不同凡响的人物，这正是那种不仅仅是要挟，而且也一定说到做到的人，主要的是，无论在哪个面前她都决不善罢甘休，况且对世间任何东西都全然不加珍重，因此甚至不可能诱惑她。这里显然另有什么名堂，反映出某种精神上的内心的浑饨慌乱，——某种充满浪漫色彩的天知道对谁和为了什么的愤懑，某种完全超出了分寸的不满足的蔑视感，——总之，是极其可笑和为上流社会所不容的，对于任何上流社会的人来说、遇上这种情况真正是碰上魔障了。当然，凭着托茨基的财富和关系可以立即做出某种小小的、完全是无可非议的恶行，以避免发生不愉快。另一方面，很显然，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜自己是几乎无能为力来做任何有害的事情的，比如说，哪怕是从法律方面来损害他、甚至她也不会做出什么不得了的无理取闹的事来，因为她总是很容易被约制住的。但是这一切只能适用于这种情况，即如果纳斯塔拉娅·费利帕夫娜决定像一般人在类似情境中一般采取的行动那样来行动，而不过分荒唐地越出常轨。但是此刻托茨基的准确眼光于他很有用处，这使他能猜透，纳斯塔西娅· 费利帕夫娜自己也清楚地懂得，在法律上她是难以损害他的，但是她头脑中想的完全是另外的计谋……这在她那双熠熠发亮的眼睛里也看得出。她对什么都不珍重，尤其是对自己（需要十分精明睿智和敏锐的洞察力才能在这时悟到，她早就已经不再珍重自己，而他这个上流社会上无耻之辈和怀疑主义者应该相信这种感情的严肃性），她能以无法挽回和不成体统的方式来毁掉自己，哪怕是去西伯利亚和服苦役，只要能玷辱她恨不得食肉寝皮的那个人，阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇从来也不隐瞒，他是个有点胆小怕事的人，或者，最好说是个极为保守的人。如果他知道，比方说，在教堂举行婚礼时有人要杀他或者发生被社会认为是不体面的，可笑的和不愉快的这类事件，他当然是会惊恐害怕的，但这种情况下，与其说他害怕的是被杀死、受伤流血或者脸上当众被人吐口沫等等，不如说是怕用反常和难堪的方式叫他受辱。而纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜虽然对此还缄默不言，可是她恰恰预示着要这样做。他知道，她对他了如指掌，因而她也知道，该如何来击中他的要害。因为婚事确实还只是在图谋之中，所以阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇也就容忍了纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜，并且做了让步。</p> 
<p>还有一个情况也帮助他做出了决定：很难想象这个新的纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜跟过去的她不同到什么地步。过去她仅仅是个很好的小姑娘，而现在……托茨基久久不能原谅自己，他看了她四年，却没有看透她。确实，双方在内心突然发生急剧的变化。这一点也很有关系。他想起了，其实，过去也有过许多瞬间曾经闪出过一些奇怪的念头，例如，有时看着她的那双眼睛，似乎预感到某种深幽莫测的阴郁。这种目光望着你，犹如给你出谜语。近两年中他常常惊异于纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜脸色的变化，她变得非常苍白，奇怪的是，却因此反而变得更好看了。托茨基正如所有那些一生纵情玩乐的绅士一样，开始时轻贱地认为，他把这个未经调教的姑娘弄到手多么便宜，近来他则怀疑起自己的看法来。不论怎样，还是在去年春天他就已经决定，在不久的将来要让纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜带着丰厚的陪嫁好好嫁给一个在另一个省份的明理和正派的先生（嗬，现在纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜可是非常恶劣、非常刻薄地嘲笑这件事！）但是现在阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇却为新的念头所动，甚至想到，他可以重新利用这个女人。他决定让纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜迁居彼得堡，将她安置在豪华舒适的环境之中。可谓失此得彼，可以利用纳斯塔拉娅·费利帕夫娜来炫耀自己，甚至在一定的社交圈内可以出一番风头，阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇在这方面可是很珍重自己的名声的。</p> 
<p>已经过了五年彼得堡的生活，当然，在这期间许多事情都确定了。阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇的情况却不能令人慰藉。最糟糕的是，他的胆怯，就再也不能放下心来。他害怕，甚至自己也不知道怕什么，就是怕纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜。头两年，他一度曾经怀疑，纳斯塔拉娅·费利帕夫娜自己想跟他结婚，但出于极度的虚荣心而缄口不言，执拗地等待他的求婚。若有这种奢望是令人奇怪的。阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇愁眉不展，苦思冥想着。因为一个偶然的情况，他忽然确信，即使他提出求婚，她也不会接受他的。很长时间他都未能理解这一点。他觉得只可能有一个解释，即“受了侮辱而又想人非非的女人”的骄矜已经到了发狂的地步：宁愿用拒绝来发泄对他的蔑视，以图一时的痛快，而放弃可以永远确定自己地位和得到不可企望的显荣的机会。最糟糕的是，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜在许多方面大占上风。她也不为利益而动心，甚至是很大的好处也不能打动她，虽然她接受了提供给她的舒适，但她生活得很朴素，在这五年中几乎什么也没积蓄，阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇为了砸断自己的锁链，曾经冒险采用狡侩的手段：他藉助于圆滑练达，用各种最理想的诱惑者，不被察觉地巧妙地引诱她，但是这些理想的化身：公爵，骠骑兵，使馆秘书，诗人，小说家，甚至社会主义者一—无论谁都未能给纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜留下任何印象，仿佛她长的不是心而是石头，而感情也己枯竭，永远绝迹了。她多半过的是离群索居的生活，看看书，甚至还进行学习，喜欢音乐。她也很少跟人家结交，认识的尽是些穷困可笑的小官吏的妻子，两个女演员，还有些老大婆，她很喜欢一位受人尊敬的教师的人口众多的家庭，而这个家庭也很爱她，并乐意接待她。每到晚上常常有五、六个熟人到她这儿来，不会更多。托茨基经常来，而且很准时。最近，叶潘钦将军好不容易才认识了纳斯塔拉娅·费利帕夫娜，而在同时，一个姓费尔迪先科的年轻官员却不费吹灰之力，很容易就认识了她。这个费尔迪先科是个厚颜无耻，有伤大雅的小丑，嗜好吃喝玩乐。还有一个奇怪的年轻人也认识了她，他姓普季岑，为人谦和、举止端庄、打扮讲究、出身穷困，如今却成了高利贷者。终于，加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇也与她结识了……结果是，有关纳斯塔拉娅·费利怕夫娜形成了一种奇怪的名声：大家都知道了她的美貌，但仅此而已，谁也不能炫耀什么，谁也不能胡说什么。这样的名声、她的教养，典雅的风度、机敏的谈吐——这一切最终使阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇确信可以实施一个计划，也就在这时，叶潘钦将军本人开始以十分积极的异常关切的态度参预了这件事。</p>  
<p>在她身上不仅觉察不到哪怕是一丝原先的嘲笑，原先的敌意和仇恨、原先的纵声大笑（只要一想起这笑声，至今托茨基都会感到阵阵寒意，砭人肌骨），相反，她仿佛很高兴她终于能跟人坦诚和友好地谈一谈。她表白说，她自己早就想请教得到友好的忠告，只是孤做妨碍她这样做，但现在坚冰已被打碎，这就再好也没有了。开始她是忧郁地微笑，后来则是快活而调皮地大笑了一通。她又说，无论如何已不存在过去的风暴，她早已多多少少改变了自己对事物的看法，虽然在内心她并没有改变自己，但毕竟不得不容忍许许多多既成的事实；已经做了的就是做了，已经过去的就是过去了，因此阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇还依然这么大惊小怪，她甚至感到诧异，这时她又转向伊万·费奥多罗维奇，用一副深为敬重的样子对他说，她早就听说了许多关于他的女儿们的事，井早已习惯于深深地、真挚地尊敬她们。要是她能为她们效劳，仅仅这一念头对她来说好像就是幸福和骄傲。她现在苦恼、寂寞，很寂寞，这是真的；阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇猜到了她的愿望；她认识到新的生活目的后，纵然不是在爱情上，就建立家庭而言，她也愿意使生活获得新生；至于说到加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇，她几乎不好说什么。确实，他似乎是爱她的；她感到，如果她能相信她对她的眷恋是矢志不移的，那么她自己也会爱上他的；但是，即使他一片真心，毕竟大年轻；马上要做决定是困艰的。其实，她最喜欢的是，他在工作，劳动，一人肩负起全家的生活。她听说，他是个有魄力的、高傲的人，想要功名，想要博取地位。她也听说，加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇的母亲尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜·伊沃尔金娜是个非常好的、非常令人尊敬的妇女；他的妹妹瓦尔瓦拉·阿尔达利翁诺夫娜是个非常出众的、坚毅刚强的姑娘；她是从普季岑那里听了许多关于她的情况。她听说，她们勇敢地承受着自己的不幸；．她很愿意认识她们，但她们是否在意在家里接待她，这还是个问题。总的来说，她没有说任何反对这桩婚姻可能性的话，但是对这件事还应该好好想想；她希望不要催促她。关于七万五千卢布，阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇难以启齿是完全不必要的，她自己也明白这些钱的价值，当然，她会收下的。她感谢阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇考虑缜密，感谢他不仅对加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇，甚至对将军也没有提及此事，但是，为什么不让加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇早点知道这件事呢？她接受这笔钱，走进他们的家庭，是没什么可以感到羞耻的。不管怎么样，她无意于为任何事向任何人去请求原谅，她希望他们知道这一点，在没有确信加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇和他的家庭对她没有暗存芥蒂之前，她是不会嫁给他的。无论怎样，她认为自己是没有丝毫过错的，因此最好是让加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇知道，这整整五年在彼得堡她是靠什么度过的，与阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇是什么关系，是否积攒了许多财产。最后，如果她现在接受了一笔钱，那也根本不是作为对她处女的耻辱的酬报（这方面她是无辜的），那只是对她那被摧残扭曲的命运的补偿。</p> 
<p>在说到末了的时候，她甚至颇为激昂和愤然（其实，这也很自然），以致叶潘钦将军倒很满意，认为事情有了彻底了结；但一度感到惊骇的托茨基到现在也不完全相信，而且长久地害怕，在花丛下面是否藏有毒蛇。但是还是开始了谈判；两位朋友整个策略立足的基点，也就是使纳斯塔西娅·费利帕多娜钟情于加尼亚这种可能性，逐渐变得明朗、确实，因而连托茨基有时也开始相信事情有可能取得成功。同时，纳斯塔拉娅·费利帕夫娜对加尼亚作了说明：她话说得很少，仿佛讲话使她的贞洁蒙受了损害。但是，她同意和允许他爱她，可又坚决声明，她不想受到任何束缚；直至婚礼前（如果举行婚礼的话）她仍保留说“不”的权利，哪怕是在最后那一刻；她也给加尼亚完全同等的权利。不久加尼亚通过热心帮忙的人明确地了解到，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜已经纤悉无遗地知道了他全家对这桩婚事以及对她本人的反感，因此而发生家庭口角；虽然他每天都等待着，她自己对他却只字不提这件事。其实，有关这次说媒及谈判显露出来的种种故事和情况，本来还可以说上更多，但就这样我们已经说远了，加上有些情况还只是十分模棱两可的传闻。比方说，托茨基似乎不知从哪儿了解到，纳斯塔西娜·费利帕夫娜与叶潘钦小姐们建立起某种暧昧的、对大家都保密的关系一这完全是难以置信的。因而他不由地要相信另一种传闻，并且怕得做恶梦一样：他听了当真的，说什么纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜似乎非常清楚地知道，加尼亚只是跟钱结婚，加尼亚有一颗卑鄙肮脏，贪得无厌、急不可耐、嫉妒眼馋和无与伦比地自尊的灵魂；虽然过去加尼亚确实热烈地要征服纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜，但当两位朋友决定利用双方刚开始产生的热情来为自己的利益服务，把纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜卖给他当合法妻子，以此收买加尼亚，这时他则如梦魔一样憎恶起她来，在他的心里仿佛奇怪地融合了激情和憎恨两种感情，尽管他在经过了苦恼的犹豫滂惶之后同意了跟这个“下流的女人”结婚，但是他自己在心里发誓要为此向她进行令她痛苦的报复，如他自己所说的，今后叫她“瞧厉害的”。所有这一切纳斯塔拉娅·费利帕夫娜似乎都知道，并且暗底里也做着什么准备。托茨基已经胆怯心虚得连对叶潘钦也不再诉说自己的惶恐不安；但是他虽是个软弱的人，也常常会</p>
