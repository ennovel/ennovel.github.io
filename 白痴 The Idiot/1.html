The morning was so damp and misty that it was only with great difficulty that the day succeeded in breaking; and it was impossible to distinguish anything more than a few yards away from the carriage windows.</p> 
<p>Some of the passengers by this particular train were returning from abroad; but the third-class carriages were the best filled, chiefly with insignificant persons of various occupations and degrees, picked up at the different stations nearer town. All of them seemed weary, and most of them had sleepy eyes and a shivering expression, while their complexions generally appeared to have taken on the colour of the fog outside.</p> 
<p>When day dawned, two passengers in one of the third-class carriages found themselves opposite each other. Both were young fellows, both were rather poorly dressed, both had remarkable faces, and both were evidently anxious to start a conversation. If they had but known why, at this particular moment, they were both remarkable persons, they would undoubtedly have wondered at the strange chance which had set them down opposite to one another in a third-class carriage of the Warsaw Railway Company.</p> 
<p>One of them was a young fellow of about twenty-seven, not tall, with black curling hair, and small, grey, fiery eyes. His nose was broad and flat, and he had high cheek bones; his thin lips were constantly compressed into an impudent, ironical--it might almost be called a malicious--smile; but his forehead was high and well formed, and atoned for a good deal of the ugliness of the lower part of his face. A special feature of this physiognomy was its death-like pallor, which gave to the whole man an indescribably emaciated appearance in spite of his hard look, and at the same time a sort of passionate and suffering expression which did not harmonize with his impudent, sarcastic smile and keen, self-satisfied bearing. He wore a large fur--or rather astrachan--overcoat, which had kept him warm all night, while his neighbour had been obliged to bear the full severity of a Russian November night entirely unprepared. His wide sleeveless mantle with a large cape to it--the sort of cloak one sees upon travellers during the winter months in Switzerland or North Italy--was by no means adapted to the long cold journey through Russia, from Eydkuhnen to St. Petersburg.</p> 
<p>The wearer of this cloak was a young fellow, also of about twenty-six or twenty-seven years of age, slightly above the middle height, very fair, with a thin, pointed and very light coloured beard; his eyes were large and blue, and had an intent look about them, yet that heavy expression which some people affirm to be a peculiarity. as well as evidence, of an epileptic subject. His face was decidedly a pleasant one for all that; refined, but quite colourless, except for the circumstance that at this moment it was blue with cold. He held a bundle made up of an old faded silk handkerchief that apparently contained all his travelling wardrobe, and wore thick shoes and gaiters, his whole appearance being very un-Russian.</p> 
<p>His black-haired neighbour inspected these peculiarities, having nothing better to do, and at length remarked, with that rude enjoyment of the discomforts of others which the common classes so often show:</p> 
<p>"Cold?"</p> 
<p>"Very," said his neighbour, readily. "and this is a thaw, too. Fancy if it had been a hard frost! I never thought it would be so cold in the old country. I've grown quite out of the way of it."</p> 
<p>"What, been abroad, I suppose?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, straight from Switzerland."</p> 
<p>"Wheugh! my goodness!" The black-haired young fellow whistled, and then laughed.</p> 
<p>The conversation proceeded. The readiness of the fair-haired young man in the cloak to answer all his opposite neighbour's questions was surprising. He seemed to have no suspicion of any impertinence or inappropriateness in the fact of such questions being put to him. Replying to them, he made known to the inquirer that he certainly had been long absent from Russia, more than four years; that he had been sent abroad for his health; that he had suffered from some strange nervous malady--a kind of epilepsy, with convulsive spasms. His interlocutor burst out laughing several times at his answers; and more than ever, when to the question, " whether he had been cured?" the patient replied:</p> 
<p>"No, they did not cure me."</p> 
<p>"Hey! that's it! You stumped up your money for nothing, and we believe in those fellows, here!" remarked the black-haired individual, sarcastically.</p> 
<p>"Gospel truth, sir, Gospel truth!" exclaimed another passenger, a shabbily dressed man of about forty, who looked like a clerk, and possessed a red nose and a very blotchy face. "Gospel truth! All they do is to get hold of our good Russian money free, gratis, and for nothing. "</p> 
<p>"Oh, but you're quite wrong in my particular instance," said the Swiss patient, quietly. "Of course I can't argue the matter, because I know only my own case; but my doctor gave me money--and he had very little--to pay my journey back, besides having kept me at his own expense, while there, for nearly two years."</p> 
<p>"Why? Was there no one else to pay for you?" asked the black- haired one.</p> 
<p>"No--Mr. Pavlicheff, who had been supporting me there, died a couple of years ago. I wrote to Mrs. General Epanchin at the time (she is a distant relative of mine), but she did not answer my letter. And so eventually I came back."</p> 
<p>"And where have you come to?"</p> 
<p>"That is--where am I going to stay? I--I really don't quite know yet, I--"</p> 
<p>Both the listeners laughed again.</p> 
<p>"I suppose your whole set-up is in that bundle, then?" asked the first.</p> 
<p>"I bet anything it is!" exclaimed the red-nosed passenger, with extreme satisfaction, "and that he has precious little in the luggage van!--though of course poverty is no crime--we must remember that!"</p> 
<p>It appeared that it was indeed as they had surmised. The young fellow hastened to admit the fact with wonderful readiness.</p> 
<p>"Your bundle has some importance, however," continued the clerk, when they had laughed their fill (it was observable that the subject of their mirth joined in the laughter when he saw them laughing); "for though I dare say it is not stuffed full of friedrichs d'or and louis d'or--judge from your costume and gaiters--still--if you can add to your possessions such a valuable property as a relation like Mrs. General Epanchin, then your bundle becomes a significant object at once. That is, of course, if you really are a relative of Mrs. Epanchin's, and have not made a little error through--well, absence of mind, which is very common to human beings; or, say--through a too luxuriant fancy?"</p> 
<p>"Oh, you are right again," said the fair-haired traveller, "for I really am ALMOST wrong when I say she and I are related. She is hardly a relation at all; so little, in fact, that I was not in the least surprised to have no answer to my letter. I expected as much."</p> 
<p>"H'm! you spent your postage for nothing, then. H'm! you are candid, however--and that is commendable. H'm! Mrs. Epanchin--oh yes! a most eminent person. I know her. As for Mr. Pavlicheff, who supported you in Switzerland, I know him too--at least, if it was Nicolai Andreevitch of that name? A fine fellow he was--and had a property of four thousand souls in his day."</p> 
<p>"Yes, Nicolai Andreevitch--that was his name," and the young fellow looked earnestly and with curiosity at the all-knowing gentleman with the red nose.</p> 
<p>This sort of character is met with pretty frequently in a certain class. They are people who know everyone--that is, they know where a man is employed, what his salary is, whom he knows, whom he married, what money his wife had, who are his cousins, and second cousins, etc., etc. These men generally have about a hundred pounds a year to live on, and they spend their whole time and talents in the amassing of this style of knowledge, which they reduce--or raise--to the standard of a science.</p> 
<p>During the latter part of the conversation the black-haired young man had become very impatient. He stared out of the window, and fidgeted, and evidently longed for the end of the journey. He was very absent; he would appear to listen-and heard nothing; and he would laugh of a sudden, evidently with no idea of what he was laughing about.</p> 
<p>"Excuse me," said the red-nosed man to the young fellow with the bundle, rather suddenly; "whom have I the honour to be talking to?"</p> 
<p>"Prince Lef Nicolaievitch Muishkin," replied the latter, with perfect readiness.</p> 
<p>"Prince Muishkin? Lef Nicolaievitch? H'm! I don't know, I'm sure! I may say I have never heard of such a person," said the clerk, thoughtfully. "At least, the name, I admit, is historical. Karamsin must mention the family name, of course, in his history- -but as an individual--one never hears of any Prince Muishkin nowadays."</p> 
<p>"Of course not," replied the prince; "there are none, except myself. I believe I am the last and only one. As to my forefathers, they have always been a poor lot; my own father was a sublieutenant in the army. I don't know how Mrs. Epanchin comes into the Muishkin family, but she is descended from the Princess Muishkin, and she, too, is the last of her line."</p> 
<p>"And did you learn science and all that, with your professor over there?" asked the black-haired passenger.</p> 
<p>"Oh yes--I did learn a little, but--"</p> 
<p>"I've never learned anything whatever," said the other.</p> 
<p>"Oh, but I learned very little, you know!" added the prince, as though excusing himself. "They could not teach me very much on account of my illness. "</p> 
<p>"Do you know the Rogojins?" asked his questioner, abruptly.</p> 
<p>"No, I don't--not at all! I hardly know anyone in Russia. Why, is that your name?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, I am Rogojin, Parfen Rogojin."</p> 
<p>"Parfen Rogojin? dear me--then don't you belong to those very Rogojins, perhaps--" began the clerk, with a very perceptible increase of civility in his tone.</p> 
<p>"Yes--those very ones," interrupted Rogojin, impatiently, and with scant courtesy. I may remark that he had not once taken any notice of the blotchy-faced passenger, and had hitherto addressed all his remarks direct to the prince.</p> 
<p>"Dear me--is it possible?" observed the clerk, while his face assumed an expression of great deference and servility--if not of absolute alarm: "what, a son of that very Semen Rogojin-- hereditary honourable citizen--who died a month or so ago and left two million and a half of roubles?"</p> 
<p>"And how do YOU know that he left two million and a half of roubles?" asked Rogojin, disdainfully, and no deigning so much as to look at the other. "However, it's true enough that my father died a month ago, and that here am I returning from Pskoff, a month after, with hardly a boot to my foot. They've treated me like a dog! I've been ill of fever at Pskoff the whole time, and not a line, nor farthing of money, have I received from my mother or my confounded brother!"</p> 
<p>"And now you'll have a million roubles, at least--goodness gracious me!" exclaimed the clerk, rubbing his hands.</p> 
<p>"Five weeks since, I was just like yourself," continued Rogojin, addressing the prince, "with nothing but a bundle and the clothes I wore. I ran away from my father and came to Pskoff to my aunt's house, where I caved in at once with fever, and he went and died while I was away. All honour to my respected father's memory--but he uncommonly nearly killed me, all the same. Give you my word, prince, if I hadn't cut and run then, when I did, he'd have murdered me like a dog."</p> 
<p>"I suppose you angered him somehow?" asked the prince, looking at the millionaire with considerable curiosity But though there may have been something remarkable in the fact that this man was heir to millions of roubles there was something about him which surprised and interested the prince more than that. Rogojin, too, seemed to have taken up the conversation with unusual alacrity it appeared that he was still in a considerable state of excitement, if not absolutely feverish, and was in real need of someone to talk to for the mere sake of talking, as safety-valve to his agitation.</p> 
<p>As for his red-nosed neighbour, the latter--since the information as to the identity of Rogojin--hung over him, seemed to be living on the honey of his words and in the breath of his nostrils, catching at every syllable as though it were a pearl of great price.</p> 
<p>"Oh, yes; I angered him--I certainly did anger him," replied Rogojin. "But what puts me out so is my brother. Of course my mother couldn't do anything--she's too old--and whatever brother Senka says is law for her! But why couldn't he let me know? He sent a telegram, they say. What's the good of a telegram? It frightened my aunt so that she sent it back to the office unopened, and there it's been ever since! It's only thanks to Konief that I heard at all; he wrote me all about it. He says my brother cut off the gold tassels from my father's coffin, at night because they're worth a lot of money!' says he. Why, I can get him sent off to Siberia for that alone, if I like; it's sacrilege. Here, you--scarecrow!" he added, addressing the clerk at his side, "is it sacrilege or not, by law?'</p> 
<p>"Sacrilege, certainly--certainly sacrilege," said the latter.</p> 
<p>"And it's Siberia for sacrilege, isn't it?"</p> 
<p>"Undoubtedly so; Siberia, of course!"</p> 
<p>"They will think that I'm still ill," continued Rogojin to the prince, "but I sloped off quietly, seedy as I was, took the train and came away. Aha, brother Senka, you'll have to open your gates and let me in, my boy! I know he told tales about me to my father--I know that well enough but I certainly did rile my father about Nastasia Philipovna that's very sure, and that was my own doing."</p> 
<p>"Nastasia Philipovna?" said the clerk, as though trying to think out something.</p> 
<p>"Come, you know nothing about HER," said Rogojin, impatiently.</p> 
<p>"And supposing I do know something?" observed the other, triumphantly.</p> 
<p>"Bosh! there are plenty of Nastasia Philipovnas. And what an impertinent beast you are!" he added angrily. "I thought some creature like you would hang on to me as soon as I got hold of my money. "</p> 
<p>"Oh, but I do know, as it happens," said the clerk in an aggravating manner. "Lebedeff knows all about her. You are pleased to reproach me, your excellency, but what if I prove that I am right after all? Nastasia Phillpovna's family name is Barashkoff--I know, you see-and she is a very well known lady, indeed, and comes of a good family, too. She is connected with one Totski, Afanasy Ivanovitch, a man of considerable property, a director of companies, and so on, and a great friend of General Epanchin, who is interested in the same matters as he is."</p> 
<p>"My eyes!" said Rogojin, really surprised at last. "The devil take the fellow, how does he know that?"</p> 
<p>"Why, he knows everything--Lebedeff knows everything! I was a month or two with Lihachof after his father died, your excellency, and while he was knocking about--he's in the debtor's prison now--I was with him, and he couldn't do a thing without Lebedeff; and I got to know Nastasia Philipovna and several people at that time."</p> 
<p>"Nastasia Philipovna? Why, you don't mean to say that she and Lihachof--" cried Rogojin, turning quite pale.</p> 
<p>"No, no, no, no, no! Nothing of the sort, I assure you!" said Lebedeff, hastily. "Oh dear no, not for the world! Totski's the only man with any chance there. Oh, no! He takes her to his box at the opera at the French theatre of an evening, and the officers and people all look at her and say, 'By Jove, there's the famous Nastasia Philipovna!' but no one ever gets any further than that, for there is nothing more to say."</p> 
<p>"Yes, it's quite true," said Rogojin, frowning gloomily; "so Zaleshoff told me. I was walking about the Nefsky one fine day, prince, in my father's old coat, when she suddenly came out of a shop and stepped into her carriage. I swear I was all of a blaze at once. Then I met Zaleshoff--looking like a hair-dresser's assistant, got up as fine as I don't know who, while I looked like a tinker. 'Don't flatter yourself, my boy,' said he; 'she's not for such as you; she's a princess, she is, and her name is Nastasia Philipovna Barashkoff, and she lives with Totski, who wishes to get rid of her because he's growing rather old--fifty- five or so--and wants to marry a certain beauty, the loveliest woman in all Petersburg.' And then he told me that I could see Nastasia Philipovna at the opera-house that evening, if I liked, and described which was her box. Well, I'd like to see my father allowing any of us to go to the theatre; he'd sooner have killed us, any day. However, I went for an hour or so and saw Nastasia Philipovna, and I never slept a wink all night after. Next morning my father happened to give me two government loan bonds to sell, worth nearly five thousand roubles each. 'Sell them,' said he, 'and then take seven thousand five hundred roubles to the office, give them to the cashier, and bring me back the rest of the ten thousand, without looking in anywhere on the way; look sharp, I shall be waiting for you.' Well, I sold the bonds, but I didn't take the seven thousand roubles to the office; I went straight to the English shop and chose a pair of earrings, with a diamond the size of a nut in each. They cost four hundred roubles more than I had, so I gave my name, and they trusted me. With the earrings I went at once to Zaleshoff's. 'Come on!' I said, 'come on to Nastasia Philipovna's,' and off we went without more ado. I tell you I hadn't a notion of what was about me or before me or below my feet all the way; I saw nothing whatever. We went straight into her drawing-room, and then she came out to us.</p> 
<p>"I didn't say right out who I was, but Zaleshoff said: 'From Parfen Rogojin, in memory of his first meeting with you yesterday; be so kind as to accept these!'</p> 
<p>"She opened the parcel, looked at the earrings, and laughed.</p> 
<p>"'Thank your friend Mr. Rogojin for his kind attention,' says she, and bowed and went off. Why didn't I die there on the spot? The worst of it all was, though, that the beast Zaleshoff got all the credit of it! I was short and abominably dressed, and stood and stared in her face and never said a word, because I was shy, like an ass! And there was he all in the fashion, pomaded and dressed out, with a smart tie on, bowing and scraping; and I bet anything she took him for me all the while!</p> 
<p>"'Look here now,' I said, when we came out, 'none of your interference here after this-do you understand?' He laughed: 'And how are you going to settle up with your father?' says he. I thought I might as well jump into the Neva at once without going home first; but it struck me that I wouldn't, after all, and I went home feeling like one of the damned."</p> 
<p>"My goodness!" shivered the clerk. "And his father," he added, for the prince's instruction, "and his father would have given a man a ticket to the other world for ten roubles any day--not to speak of ten thousand!"</p> 
<p>The prince observed Rogojin with great curiosity; he seemed paler than ever at this moment.</p> 
<p>"What do you know about it?" cried the latter. "Well, my father learned the whole story at once, and Zaleshoff blabbed it all over the town besides. So he took me upstairs and locked me up, and swore at me for an hour. 'This is only a foretaste,' says he; 'wait a bit till night comes, and I'll come back and talk to you again.'</p> 
<p>"Well, what do you think? The old fellow went straight off to Nastasia Philipovna, touched the floor with his forehead, and began blubbering and beseeching her on his knees to give him back the diamonds. So after awhile she brought the box and flew out at him. 'There,' she says, 'take your earrings, you wretched old miser; although they are ten times dearer than their value to me now that I know what it must have cost Parfen to get them! Give Parfen my compliments,' she says, 'and thank him very much!' Well, I meanwhile had borrowed twenty-five roubles from a friend, and off I went to Pskoff to my aunt's. The old woman there lectured me so that I left the house and went on a drinking tour round the public-houses of the place. I was in a high fever when I got to Pskoff, and by nightfall I was lying delirious in the streets somewhere or other!"</p> 
<p>"Oho! we'll make Nastasia Philipovna sing another song now!" giggled Lebedeff, rubbing his hands with glee. "Hey, my boy, we'll get her some proper earrings now! We'll get her such earrings that--"</p> 
<p>"Look here," cried Rogojin, seizing him fiercely by the arm, "look here, if you so much as name Nastasia Philipovna again, I'll tan your hide as sure as you sit there!"</p> 
<p>"Aha! do--by all means! if you tan my hide you won't turn me away from your society. You'll bind me to you, with your lash, for ever. Ha, ha! here we are at the station, though."</p> 
<p>Sure enough, the train was just steaming in as he spoke.</p> 
<p>Though Rogojin had declared that he left Pskoff secretly, a large collection of friends had assembled to greet him, and did so with profuse waving of hats and shouting.</p> 
<p>"Why, there's Zaleshoff here, too!" he muttered, gazing at the scene with a sort of triumphant but unpleasant smile. Then he suddenly turned to the prince: "Prince, I don't know why I have taken a fancy to you; perhaps because I met you just when I did. But no, it can't be that, for I met this fellow " (nodding at Lebedeff) "too, and I have not taken a fancy to him by any means. Come to see me, prince; we'll take off those gaiters of yours and dress you up in a smart fur coat, the best we can buy. You shall have a dress coat, best quality, white waistcoat, anything you like, and your pocket shall be full of money. Come, and you shall go with me to Nastasia Philipovna's. Now then will you come or no?"</p> 
<p>"Accept, accept, Prince Lef Nicolaievitch" said Lebedef solemnly; "don't let it slip! Accept, quick!"</p> 
<p>Prince Muishkin rose and stretched out his hand courteously, while he replied with some cordiality:</p> 
<p>"I will come with the greatest pleasure, and thank you very much for taking a fancy to me. I dare say I may even come today if I have time, for I tell you frankly that I like you very much too. I liked you especially when you told us about the diamond earrings; but I liked you before that as well, though you have such a dark-clouded sort of face. Thanks very much for the offer of clothes and a fur coat; I certainly shall require both clothes and coat very soon. As for money, I have hardly a copeck about me at this moment."</p> 
<p>"You shall have lots of money; by the evening I shall have plenty; so come along!"</p> 
<p>"That's true enough, he'll have lots before evening!" put in Lebedeff.</p> 
<p>"But, look here, are you a great hand with the ladies? Let's know that first?" asked Rogojin.</p> 
<p>"Oh no, oh no! said the prince; "I couldn't, you know--my illness--I hardly ever saw a soul."</p> 
<p>"H'm! well--here, you fellow-you can come along with me now if you like!" cried Rogojin to Lebedeff, and so they all left the carriage.</p> 
<p>Lebedeff had his desire. He went off with the noisy group of Rogojin's friends towards the Voznesensky, while the prince's route lay towards the Litaynaya. It was damp and wet. The prince asked his way of passers-by, and finding that he was a couple of miles or so from his destination, he determined to take a droshky.</p>  
<p>在一节三等车厢里，有两个旅客从天亮起就面对面坐在窗口，两人都年轻，两人几乎都不带什么行李，两人穿得也讲究，两人都有相当引人注目的长相，再有，两人又都愿意互相攀谈。如果他们俩一个知道另一个此刻特别出众在什么地方，那么无疑会对机遇这么奇妙地使他们面对面坐在彼得堡－华沙铁路线的三等车厢里感到不胜惊讶了。他们中一个个子不高、２７岁左右，有着几乎是黑色的卷曲的头发，一双灰色的但是炯炯有神的小眼睛，宽而扁的鼻子，颧骨大大的脸庞。他那薄薄的嘴唇时而露出一种厚颜无耻的、嘲讽的、甚至刻毒的微笑，但是他有一个高高的额头，样子很好看，这就掩饰了长得丑陋的脸的下部。在这张脸上死一般苍白的脸色特别显眼，虽然年轻人体格相当强壮，但是这种苍白却使他的整个脸呈现出疲惫不堪的样子。与此同时，他的脸上还有某种激情，令人不安，这和他那无耻、粗野的微笑以及犀利、自我满足的目光很不相称。他穿得很暖和，身上是一件宽大的黑色面子的羔羊皮袄，所以夜间没有挨冻，而他的邻座显然对１１月俄罗斯潮湿的寒夜缺少准备，因而浑身打颤，不得不饱受寒冷的滋味。他身穿一件带有一顶大风帽的相当肥大的无袖斗蓬，与遥远的国外如瑞士或意大利北部冬天旅客们常穿的斗蓬完全一样，而他们当然没有考虑从艾德库年到彼得堡这样的路程。但是在意大利适用而且完全可以满足需要的东西，在俄罗斯却显得全然不合适了。穿着带风帽斗蓬的人是个年轻人，也是２６或２７岁左右，中等偏高的个子，有一头稠密的颜色非常浅的头发，凹陷的双颊稀疏地长着几乎是全白的楔形胡须。他那碧蓝的大眼睛专注凝神，但目光中有某种平静而沉郁的神态，充满了奇怪的表情，有些人根据这种表情一眼就能猜测到这个人患有癫痫病。不过，年轻人的脸是讨人喜欢的，清瘦而秀气，但是没有血色，现在甚至冻得发青。他的手中晃动着一个用褪色旧花布裹起来的小包袱，大概，其中便是他的全部行装了。他的脚上是一双带鞋罩的厚底鞋。这一切都不是俄罗斯的装束。穿皮袄的黑发邻座看出了这一切，浮现。出一丝粗鲁的嘲笑，有时候人们在旁人失败时就是这样无礼地、漫不经心地表达他们的幸灾乐祸的。部分地是因为无事可做，终于他问道：</p> 
<p>“冷吗？”</p> 
<p>他说着，耸了耸肩。</p> 
<p>“很冷，”邻座非常乐意回答说，“而且，您瞧，还是解冻的日子，如果到了严寒，会是怎样呢：我甚至没有想到，我们这儿竟这么冷，已经不习惯了。”</p> 
<p>“从国外来，是吗？”</p> 
<p>“是的，从瑞士来。”</p> 
<p>“嗬，瞧您！……”</p> 
<p>黑头发的年轻人吹了一声口哨，便哈哈大笑起来。</p> 
<p>话就这样攀谈开了，穿着瑞士斗蓬的浅色卷发的年轻人准备回答皮肤黝黑的邻座提出的所有问题。他的这种态度是令人惊讶的，而且他丝毫没有计较有些问题提得十分随便，不得体和无聊。他一边回答，一边顺便表明，他确实有很长时间不在俄罗斯了，有四年多了，他是因病去国外的，那是一种奇怪的神经毛病，类似癫痫或舞蹈病，不知怎么的要打颤和痉挛。黑皮肤那个人听着他说，好几次都暗自窃笑。当他问到：“结果治好了吗？”而浅色卷发者回答说“没有，没治好”时，他更是笑了起来。</p> 
<p>“嘿，钱呢，一定白白花了许多，而我们这里的人就是相信他们，”黑皮肤那一个讥讽说。</p> 
<p>“千真万确，”坐在旁边的一个插进来说。这位先生穷得很蹩脚，大概是十多年未升迁的小公务员，４０岁左右，体格强壮，红鼻子，脸上长满粉刺。“干真万确，只不过俄罗斯的财力全都被他们白白弄去了。”</p> 
<p>“哦，我这件事上您可就错了，”从瑞士回来的病人平静和忍让地说，“当然，我不会争论，因为我不了解整个情况，但是我的医生却倾其所有给我到这里的路费，而且在那里供养了我几乎有两年。”</p> 
<p>“怎么，没有人给您钱吗？”黑皮肤的问。</p> 
<p>“是的，在那里供养我的帕夫利谢夫先生两年前去世了，后来我写信给这里的叶潘钦将军夫人，她是我的远房亲戚，但我没有收到口信、这样我就回来了。”</p> 
<p>“您去哪里呢？”</p> 
<p>“也就是我住在哪里吗？……我还不知道，真的……是这样……”</p> 
<p>“还没有决定吗？”</p> 
<p>两位听者重又哈哈大笑起来。</p> 
<p>“您的全部财产不会都在这个包裹里吧？”黑皮肤的人问。</p> 
<p>“我准备打赌，就是这样，”红鼻子公务员异常得意地附和着，“行李车厢里没有别的行李，虽然贫穷不是罪，这点还是不能不指出的。”</p> 
<p>原来正是这样。浅色卷发的年轻人立即异常急促地承认了这一点。</p> 
<p>“您的包裹总是有点用处的，”当大家畅笑一通后（值得注意的是包裹，所有者本人一边望着他们，一边终于也笑了起来，这更使他们快活），小公务员继续说， “虽然前以打赌；这个包裹里没有包着拿破仑金币和用；特烈金币、甚至荷兰市的一包包外国的金币，只要根据蒙在您那外国鞋上的攀罩也可以断定这一点，但是……假如您的包裹之外再添上像叶潘钦将军夫人这么一位所谓的女亲戚，那么这个包裹也就会有另一种意义了，当然，只有在叶潘钦将军夫人真南是您亲戚的情况下才是这样。您不会因为漫不经心而搞错吧……这是人非常容易犯的毛病，哪怕是……由于过分丰富的想象。”</p> 
<p>“嘿，您又猜对了，”浅色头发的年轻人应着说，“我真的几乎弄错了，也就是说，她几乎不是我的亲戚，我们的关系太远，以致于他们没给我回信，我丝毫也不感到惊讶，真的，我早就料到是这样。”</p> 
<p>“白白花费了邮资，嗯……至少您是忠厚老实的，这是值得称赞的！嗯……叶潘钦将军我们是知道的，其实是因为他是社会名流；还有在瑞士供养您的已故的帕夫利谢夫先生，我也知道，如果这是指尼古拉·安德列耶维奇·帕夫利谢夫，因为他们是两位堂兄弟，另一位至今还在克里米亚，而尼古拉·安德列耶维奇这位故人就是在广泛的社交界也是位令人敬重的人，那时拥有四千农奴……”</p> 
<p>“确实，他叫尼古拉·安德列耶维奇·帕夫利谢夫，”回答完了，年轻人专注而文好奇地打量了一番这位无所不知的先生。</p> 
<p>在一定的社会阶层，有时候，甚至相当经常地可以遇见这种无所不知的先生，他们什么都知道。他们的智慧和能力，他们那时刻涌动的好奇心都不。可遏制地倾注到一个方面，现代的思想家会说，当然这是因为缺少比较重要的生活情趣和观点的缘故。不过，“什么都知道”这句话所指的范围是有限的。某个人在某处供职，他跟谁认识，他有多少财产，在什么地方当过省长，跟谁结的婚，得到多少陪嫁，谁是他的堂兄弟，谁是表兄弟，等等等等，诸如此类。这些无所不知的先生大部分都穿着肘部磨破的衣服，每个月只拿１７卢布的薪俸。被他们了解全部内情的人们，当然怎么也想象不到；是什么兴趣驱使着他们，与此同时，他们中又有许多人又因为这种几乎无异于整门科学的知识而感到欣慰，因为他们得到了自尊，甚至是高度的精神满足。再说，这门科学也挺诱人的，我看到过不少学者、文学家、诗人和政治活动家在这门科学里寻求和寻得了自己高度的安宁和目的，甚至就凭这一点得到了功名，在整个这场谈话中，黑皮肤的年轻人打着呵欠，漫无目的地望着窗外，急不可耐地等待着旅程结束，他似乎有点心不在焉，甚至非常心不在焉，几乎是焦躁不安，以致变得有点令人奇怪：有时似听非听，似看非看，有时他笑，又不知道和不明白在笑什么。</p> 
<p>“请问，您尊姓？……”突然，脸上长粉刺的先生问拿着小包的浅色头发的青年。</p> 
<p>“列夫·尼古拉耶维奇·梅什金公爵，”后者完全不加思索地马上回答说。</p> 
<p>“梅什金公爵？列夫·尼古拉耶维奇？我不知道，甚至还没有听说过，”小公务员沉思着说，“就是说，我不是指姓名，这个姓名历史上就有、在卡拉姆辛写的历史书里可以也应该能找得到，我是说人，再说，不知怎么的无论在哪儿都遇不到梅什金公爵家族的人，甚至沓无音讯。”</p> 
<p>“噢，那还用说！”公爵立即回答说，“除我之外，现在根本就没有梅什金公爵家族的人了。我好像是我们家族的最后一个人了。至于说到父辈、祖辈，他们都是独院小地主＊，不过，我的父亲是陆军少尉，他是士官生土身。连我也不知道，叶潘钦将军夫人怎么从梅什金公爵女儿们中间冒出来的。她也是自己那一族的最后一人了……”</p> 
<p>“嘻－嘻－嘻！自己族的最后一个！嘻－嘻！您怎么倒过来这么说，”小公务员嘻嘻笑着说。</p> 
<p>＊拥有农奴的小地主，通常一院一户。</p> 
<p>黑皮肤的年轻人也冷笑了一下。浅色头发的青年则有点惊讶，他竟会说出相当不好的双关语。＊</p> 
<p>“您要知道，我完全不加思索就说了，”惊讶之余，他终于解释道。</p> 
<p>“可以理解，可以理解，”小公务员快活地连声说。</p> 
<p>“公爵，在国外您在教授那里学过什么科学吧？”突然黑皮肤的年轻人问。</p> 
<p>“是的……学过……”</p> 
<p>“可我从来也没有学过什么。”</p> 
<p>“但我也只是随便学了点，”公爵补充说，差不多是表示道歉，“因为有病，认为我不可能进行系统学习。”</p> 
<p>“您知道罗戈任家吗？”黑皮肤的很快问着。</p> 
<p>“不知道，完全不知道。我在俄罗斯认识的人很少。您就是罗戈任？”</p> 
<p>“是的，我姓罗戈任，叫帕尔芬。”</p> 
<p>“帕尔芬？这不就是那一家罗戈任……”小公务员特别傲慢地说。</p> 
<p>“是的，是那家，就是那家，”黑皮肤的年轻，人很快地、不讲礼貌地、急迫地打断了他。其实，他根本一次也没有对长粉刺的小公务员说话，从一开始他就只对公爵一个人说话。</p> 
<p>“是吗……这是怎么回事？”小公务员惊呆了，几乎瞪出了眼珠。他的整张脸马上就现出一种虔敬和馅媚的，甚至是惶恐的神情。“您就是那位世袭荣誉公民谢苗·帕尔芬诺维奇·罗戈任的公子吗？他不是一个月前故世，留下了两百五十万财产吗？”</p> 
<p>“您打哪儿知道他留下了两百五十万财产。”黑皮肤的打断他问，就连这次他也没有赏给小公务员上一瞥。“您瞧，”他朝公爵霎了霎眼，意指说的是小公务员， “他们知道这些会得到什么好处，于吗他们马上就像走狗似的一个劲地粘上来？我父亲去世了，这是真的，已经过了一个月，现在我差点连靴子也没有从普斯科夫赶回家，无论是混账哥哥，还是母亲，都不给我寄钱，也不寄消息……什么都不寄，犹如对待一条狗！我在普斯科夫患热病，躺了整整一个月！……”</p> 
<p>“可现在一下子就必能得到一百多万，这是起码的，天哪！”小公务员双手一拍说。</p> 
<p>＊俄语Ｂ cboem pone还有一种含义：“就某一点来说”。</p> 
<p>“您倒说说，这管他什么事！”罗戈任恼怒和愤感地又朝他点了一下头，“此刻你即使在我面前做倒立，我也不会给你一戈比。”</p> 
<p>“我还是愿意做，愿意做。”</p> 
<p>“瞧你！可是要知道，你哪怕跳一个星期舞，我也不会给，不会给的！”</p> 
<p>“也不用给！我就该这样，不用给！我要跳舞，我就是抛下妻子、小孩，还是要在你面前跳舞，让你满意，让你快活！”</p> 
<p>“去你的！”黑皮肤的啐了一口；“五个星期前我就像您这样，”他对公爵说，“带着一个小包裹逃离父亲去普斯科夫的姑妈家，在那里得了热病，躺倒了，而父亲却在我不在的情况下去世了，是中风而死的。死者千古，而那时他差点没把我打死。您相信吗，公爵，”这是真的！那时我要是不跑，马上就会把我打死的。”</p> 
<p>“您做了什么事让他发脾气了？”公爵接过话茬说。他怀着一种特别的好奇心打量着穿皮袄的百万富翁，虽然百万富翁身上和得到遗产这件事确有某种值得注意的东西，但是使公爵惊奇和产生兴趣的还有别的因素，再说，罗戈任本人不知为什么特别愿意把公爵看作交谈的对象，尽管他需要交谈，似乎是无意识多于精神的需求，似乎是漫不经心多于心地忠厚，是出于忐忑不安，忧心焦虑，交谈只是为了望着对方，随便胡扯些什么。好像他到现在仍患着热病，至少也是疟疾。至于说那小公务员，他硬是缠住罗戈任，气也不敢喘一口，留神和琢磨着每一句话，就像寻找钻石一般。</p> 
<p>“脾气是发了，也许，也是该发的，”罗戈任回答说，“但是我那哥哥害得我最苦，至于老母亲是没什么可说的，她年纪大了，只是看看日课经文月书，与老太太们坐着聊聊天，谢恩卡哥哥决定什么就是什么，而他当时为什么不让我知道呢？我可是明白的！我那时神志昏迷，这是真的，据说，也发来过电报、但是给姑妈的，她在那里寡居３０年了，从早到晚总跟一些装疯卖傻的修士在一起，她修女不是修女，却比修女更有过之无不及，电报把她吓坏了，她拆也不拆，就把它送到警察局去了，至今它还留在那儿。只有科涅夫·瓦西利·瓦西利耶维奇帮了大忙，把一切都告诉了我；夜里哥哥从盖在灵枢上的绵缎上剪下了流苏，那是铸金的，说什么‘据说，它们很值钱！’可是就凭这一点，只要我想干的话，他就可能去西伯利亚，因为这是亵读神圣的。喂，你这个家伙！”他朝小公务员说，“照法律讲，是亵读神圣吗？”</p> 
<p>“是亵读神圣！亵读神圣！”小公务员立即附和说。</p> 
<p>“为此要流放去西伯利亚吗。”</p> 
<p>“要去西伯利亚，西伯利亚！立即去西伯利亚！”</p> 
<p>“他们一直以为我还病着，”罗戈任对公爵说，“而我一句话也不说，抱着病体，悄悄地上了火车，就这么走了。谢苗·谢苗内奇哥哥，请开门吧！他对故世的父亲说了我许多坏话，我知道。我确实因为纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜当时惹恼了父亲，这是真的，这是我一个人做的事，我是有过失。”</p> 
<p>“因为纳斯塔西娅，费利帕夫娜。”小公务员馅媚地说，他似乎在揣度着什么。</p> 
<p>“你可是不会知道的！”罗戈任不耐烦地朝他喊了一声。</p> 
<p>“我就知道！”小公务员以胜利的口吻回答说。</p> 
<p>“瞧你！叫纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的人还少吗？我说你呀，是个多么厚颜无耻的家伙！嘿，我就知道，就有这样的家伙马上来缠住你！”他继续对公爵说。</p> 
<p>“可是，也许，我是知道的呢。”小公务员连忙接着说，“列别杰夫是知道的！您，阁下，可以责备我，但是，要是我能证明，又怎么样呢，是有纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜此人的，为了她，您父亲要用英莲木拐杖来教训您。而纳斯塔拉娅·费利帕夫娜是姓巴拉什科娃，说起来还是个名门闺秀；也是公爵小姐之类的，她跟一个姓托茨基，叫阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇的来往，就只跟他一个人交往，那人是个地主兼资本家，许多公司和社团的股东和要员，因此与叶潘钦将军有很深的交谊……”</p> 
<p>“晦，原来你还真有两下子。”罗戈任终于真正感到惊讶了，“呸，真见鬼，他倒真的什么都知道！”</p> 
<p>“全都知道！列别杰夫无所不知！阁下，我还和利哈乔夫·阿列克萨什卡一起周游了两个月，也是在他父亲去世以后。我知道所有的角落和小巷，没有我列别杰夫，他甚至寸步难行。他现在身陷债务监狱，而就在那个时候我有机会认识阿尔曼斯和科拉利娅，帕茨卡娅公爵夫人和纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜，也就有机会知道许多事。”</p> 
<p>“你认识纳斯塔拉娅·费利帕夫娜？难道她跟利哈乔夫……”罗戈任恶狠狠地瞥了他一眼，连嘴唇也变白了，哆嗦起来。</p> 
<p>“没什么！没——什么的！的确没什么！”小公务员有所领悟，便急忙说，“也就是说，利哈乔夫无论用多少钱也未能把她弄到手！不，这可不是那个阿尔曼斯，她只有一一个托茨基，晚。上在大剧院或者法兰西剧院她也只坐在自己的包厢里，那里军官们相互间闲话还少吗，可他们对她却说不出什么名堂来，‘瞧，据说，这就是那个纳斯塔西娅·赞利帕夫娜。’仅此而已，再要说什么就没什么可说了！因此，是没有什么的。”</p> 
<p>“这事确实这样，”罗戈任皱起眉目，阴郁地肯定说，“扎廖热夫那时也对我这么说过。公爵，我那时穿着父亲那件只穿了三天的腰部打招的大衣过涅瓦大街，而她正从商店出来，坐上马车。当时我一下子犹如浑身着了似的。我常见到扎廖热夫，他跟我可不一样，打扮得像个理发店的伙计。只眼睛上架着眼镜，可我在父亲家里穿的是抹了油的皮靴，喝的是素汤，说这个跟你不相配，还说，这是位公爵小姐，名叫纳斯塔拉娅·费利帕夫娜，姓巴拉什科娃，她跟托茨基同居，而托茨基现在都不知道怎么摆脱她，因为他，这么说吧，完全到了真正的年龄，５５岁，想要跟全彼得堡头号美女结婚。扎廖热夫当下就怂恿我说，今天你可以在大剧院见到纳斯塔西娅·费里帕夫娜，她将坐在第一层厢座自己的包厢里看芭蕾，可在我们家里你倒试试去看芭蕾——准会受到惩罚，父亲会把我们打死！但是，我还是偷偷地去了一小时，又一次看见了纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜。那天一整夜我都没有睡着。第二天早晨父亲给了我两张百分之五利率的证券，每张五千卢布。他说，去卖掉它们，七千五百卢布拿到安德列耶夫事务所，付清了，哪儿也别去，把一万剩下的数拿来交给我，我等你。我卖了证券，拿了钱，但是没有去安德列耶夫事务所，而是哪儿也不张望，径自去了一家英国商店，用全部钱挑了一副耳坠，每个耳坠上都有一颗钻石，几乎就像核桃那么大，还欠了四百卢布，我讲出了姓名，他们相信了。我带了耳坠去找扎廖热夫，如此这般说了一番，‘兄弟，我们去找纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜’，我们就去了。当时我脚下是什么，前面是什么，旁边是什么——概都不知道，也不记得，我们径直走进她的客厅。她亲自出来见我们。我当时没有说出自己来，而由扎廖热夫说‘帕尔芬·罗戈任送给您的，以作昨天邂逅相遇的纪念，请俯允受纳。’她打开盒子，瞥了一眼，冷笑一声说：‘请感谢您的朋友罗戈任先生，感谢他的感情厚意。’她转身便走开了。唉，我于吗当时不马上死掉！如果真的想去死，是因为我想，‘反正回去也活不！’最使我委屈的是，我觉得扎廖热夫这骗子占尽了风流。我个子也小，穿得像个仆人，因为自惭形秽，便一声不吭地站在那里。只是瞪着眼睛看她。可扎廖热夫却非常时髦，头发抹手油亮；还烫成卷发，脸色红润，结着方格领带，一味的奉承，满嘴的恭维，另时她大概把他当作是我了。我们出来后，我就说：‘喂，现在再不许你想我的人，明白吗？”他笑着说，“现在你怎么向谢苗·帕尔芬内奇交帐。”我当时真的想家也不回就去投河，可是又想，‘反正都一样’，于是犹如十恶不赦的罪人似的回家去了。”</p> 
<p>“哎哟！喔嗬！”小公务员做了个鬼脸，甚至打起颤来，“要知道，已故先人不要说为一万卢布，就是为十个卢布也会把人打发到阴间去。”他朝公点了下头，公爵好奇地端详着罗戈任，好像此刻他的脸更加苍白了。</p> 
<p>“打发到阴间！”罗戈任重复说了一遍，“你知道什么？”他对公爵说，“父亲马上全都知道了，再说，扎廖热夫也逢人便吹。父亲把我抓起来，关在楼上，教训我足足一小时，他说，‘我这只是先让你有个准备，到夜里我再跟你告别。’你想怎么着？老头到纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜那儿去了，连连向她叩头，央求着，哭着，她终于拿出了盒子，扔了给她，说，‘喏，给你，胡子，你的耳环，现在它们对我来说价值珍贵十倍，因为它是帕尔芬冒着么大的风险弄来的，向帕尔芬·谢苗诺维奇致意，向他表示感谢！’而我在这个时候得到母亲的赞同，在谢廖什卡·普罗图京那儿弄了２０卢布，就乘车到普斯科夫去了，到那几时我正害着疟疾，在那里一些老妇人没完没了令人心烦地对我念教堂日历，而我坐在那里喝得醉熏熏的，后来我去了好几家酒馆，花光了最后一点钱，一整夜躺在街上不省人事，到了早晨发起了热病，而夜里的时候狗还咬了我，好不容易才醒过来。”</p> 
<p>“好了，好了，现在纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜会改变态度了！”小公务一边搓着手，一边嘻嘻笑着，“现在，老爷，耳坠算得了什么！现在我们可补偿给她同样的耳坠……”</p> 
<p>“要是你再说一次有关纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的一个字，你就给我滚蛋，我就揍死你，尽管你跟随过利哈乔夫！”罗戈任紧紧抓住他的手，嚷道。</p> 
<p>“既然你要揍死我，就是说你不会放开我！揍吧！揍了，也就铭记住了……瞧，我们到站了！”</p> 
<p>确实，火车驶进了站台，虽然罗戈任说过，他是偷偷地来的，但是已有好几个人在等候他。他们呼喊着，向他挥舞着帽子。</p> 
<p>“瞧，扎廖热夫也在！”罗戈任嘟哝着说，一边得意地甚至狞笑着望着他们，突然，他转向公爵说，“公爵，我也不知道，我喜欢上你什么，也许是为这种时刻遇见了你，不过也还遇上了他（他指了指列别杰夫），可我没有喜欢上他、到我家来吧，公爵，我们要脱下你脚上的这副鞋罩，我要给你穿最好的貂皮大衣，给你缝制上等的燕尾服，白色的或者随便什么颜色的背，口袋里钱塞得满满的……再一起到纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜那里去！你来不来呀？”</p> 
<p>“听从吧，列夫·尼古拉耶维奇公爵！”列别杰夫颇能感化人地郑重其事地附和说，“嗨，可别错过机会！嗨，可别错过机会！”</p> 
<p>梅什金公爵站起来，彬彬有礼地向罗戈任递过手去，客气地说：</p> 
<p>“我将十分乐意去府上拜访，蒙您喜欢我，不胜感激，甚至，如果来得及的话，也许今天我就会来的，因为，我坦率地对您说，我也非常喜欢您本人，特别是您讲到钻石耳坠的时候，甚至在讲耳坠之前就喜欢了，尽管您脸上一副愁眉不展的样手。我也感谢您允诺为我添置衣物和皮大衣，因为我确实很快就需要衣服和皮大衣了，眼前我几乎身无分文。”</p> 
<p>“钱会有的，到傍晚就有，来吧。”</p> 
<p>“会有的，会有的，”小公务员应声说，“不到晚霞时分就会有了！”</p> 
<p>“您，公爵，对女人兴趣大吗？早点告诉我。”</p> 
<p>“我，不——不！我可是……您大概不知道，我因为先天的毛病，甚至根本不懂女人的事。”</p> 
<p>“噢，既然这样。”罗戈任大声嚷着，“公爵，你真是一位苦行僧了，像你这样的人，上帝都会喜欢的！”</p> 
<p>“这样的人上帝会喜欢的！”小公务员应声说。</p> 
<p>“那你就跟我走吧，应声虫，”罗戈任对列别杰夫说。他们走出了车厢。</p> 
<p>列别杰夫终于达到了自己的目的。熙熙攘攘的人群沿着去沃兹涅先斯基大街的方向远去。公爵本应该拐向利捷伊纳亚街。天气很潮湿，公爵向行人问了路，到他所要去的地方有三俄里左右，他决定雇一辆马车。</p>
