<p>Aglaya did not so much as glance at the new arrivals, but went on with her recitation, gazing at the prince the while in an affected manner, and at him alone. It was clear to him that she was doing all this with some special object.</p> 
<p>But the new guests at least somewhat eased his strained and uncomfortable position. Seeing them approaching, he rose from his chair, and nodding amicably to the general, signed to him not to interrupt the recitation. He then got behind his chair, and stood there with his left hand resting on the back of it. Thanks to this change of position, he was able to listen to the ballad with far less embarrassment than before. Mrs. Epanchin had also twice motioned to the new arrivals to be quiet, and stay where they were.</p> 
<p>The prince was much interested in the young man who had just entered. He easily concluded that this was Evgenie Pavlovitch Radomski, of whom he had already heard mention several times. He was puzzled, however, by the young man's plain clothes, for he had always heard of Evgenie Pavlovitch as a military man. An ironical smile played on Evgenie's lips all the while the recitation was proceeding, which showed that he, too, was probably in the secret of the 'poor knight' joke. But it had become quite a different matter with Aglaya. All the affectation of manner which she had displayed at the beginning disappeared as the ballad proceeded. She spoke the lines in so serious and exalted a manner, and with so much taste, that she even seemed to justify the exaggerated solemnity with which she had stepped forward. It was impossible to discern in her now anything but a deep feeling for the spirit of the poem which she had undertaken to interpret.</p> 
<p>Her eyes were aglow with inspiration, and a slight tremor of rapture passed over her lovely features once or twice. She continued to recite:</p> 
<p>"Once there came a vision glorious, Mystic, dreadful, wondrous fair; Burned itself into his spirit, And abode for ever there!</p> 
<p>"Never more--from that sweet moment-- Gazed he on womankind; He was dumb to love and wooing And to all their graces blind.</p> 
<p>"Full of love for that sweet vision, Brave and pure he took the field; With his blood he stained the letters N. P. B. upon his shield.</p> 
<p>"'Lumen caeli, sancta Rosa!' Shouting on the foe he fell, And like thunder rang his war-cry O'er the cowering infidel.</p> 
<p>"Then within his distant castle, Home returned, he dreamed his days- Silent, sad,--and when death took him He was mad, the legend says."</p> 
<p>When recalling all this afterwards the prince could not for the life of him understand how to reconcile the beautiful, sincere, pure nature of the girl with the irony of this jest. That it was a jest there was no doubt whatever; he knew that well enough, and had good reason, too, for his conviction; for during her recitation of the ballad Aglaya had deliberately changed the letters A. N. B. into N. P. B. He was quite sure she had not done this by accident, and that his ears had not deceived him. At all events her performance--which was a joke, of course, if rather a crude one,--was premeditated. They had evidently talked (and laughed) over the 'poor knight' for more than a month.</p> 
<p>Yet Aglaya had brought out these letters N. P. B. not only without the slightest appearance of irony, or even any particular accentuation, but with so even and unbroken an appearance of seriousness that assuredly anyone might have supposed that these initials were the original ones written in the ballad. The thing made an uncomfortable impression upon the prince. Of course Mrs. Epanchin saw nothing either in the change of initials or in the insinuation embodied therein. General Epanchin only knew that there was a recitation of verses going on, and took no further interest in the matter. Of the rest of the audience, many had understood the allusion and wondered both at the daring of the lady and at the motive underlying it, but tried to show no sign of their feelings. But Evgenie Pavlovitch (as the prince was ready to wager) both comprehended and tried his best to show that he comprehended; his smile was too mocking to leave any doubt on that point.</p> 
<p>"How beautiful that is!" cried Mrs. Epanchin, with sincere admiration. "Whose is it? '</p> 
<p>"Pushkin's, mama, of course! Don't disgrace us all by showing your ignorance," said Adelaida.</p> 
<p>"As soon as we reach home give it to me to read."</p> 
<p>"I don't think we have a copy of Pushkin in the house."</p> 
<p>"There are a couple of torn volumes somewhere; they have been lying about from time immemorial," added Alexandra.</p> 
<p>"Send Feodor or Alexey up by the very first train to buy a copy, then.--Aglaya, come here--kiss me, dear, you recited beautifully! but," she added in a whisper, "if you were sincere I am sorry for you. If it was a joke, I do not approve of the feelings which prompted you to do it, and in any case you would have done far better not to recite it at all. Do you understand?--Now come along, young woman; we've sat here too long. I'll speak to you about this another time."</p> 
<p>Meanwhile the prince took the opportunity of greeting General Epanchin, and the general introduced Evgenie Pavlovitch to him.</p> 
<p>"I caught him up on the way to your house," explained the general. "He had heard that we were all here."</p> 
<p>"Yes, and I heard that you were here, too," added Evgenie Pavlovitch; "and since I had long promised myself the pleasure of seeking not only your acquaintance but your friendship, I did not wish to waste time, but came straight on. I am sorry to hear that you are unwell."</p> 
<p>"Oh, but I'm quite well now, thank you, and very glad to make your acquaintance. Prince S. has often spoken to me about you," said Muishkin, and for an instant the two men looked intently into one another's eyes.</p> 
<p>The prince remarked that Evgenie Pavlovitch's plain clothes had evidently made a great impression upon the company present, so much so that all other interests seemed to be effaced before this surprising fact.</p> 
<p>His change of dress was evidently a matter of some importance. Adelaida and Alexandra poured out a stream of questions; Prince S., a relative of the young man, appeared annoyed; and Ivan Fedorovitch quite excited. Aglaya alone was not interested. She merely looked closely at Evgenie for a minute, curious perhaps as to whether civil or military clothes became him best, then turned away and paid no more attention to him or his costume. Lizabetha Prokofievna asked no questions, but it was clear that she was uneasy, and the prince fancied that Evgenie was not in her good graces.</p> 
<p>"He has astonished me," said Ivan Fedorovitch. "I nearly fell down with surprise. I could hardly believe my eyes when I met him in Petersburg just now. Why this haste? That's what I want to know. He has always said himself that there is no need to break windows."</p> 
<p>Evgenie Pavlovitch remarked here that he had spoken of his intention of leaving the service long ago. He had, however, always made more or less of a joke about it, so no one had taken him seriously. For that matter he joked about everything, and his friends never knew what to believe, especially if he did not wish them to understand him.</p> 
<p>"I have only retired for a time," said he, laughing. "For a few months; at most for a year."</p> 
<p>"But there is no necessity for you to retire at all," complained the general, "as far as I know."</p> 
<p>"I want to go and look after my country estates. You advised me to do that yourself," was the reply. "And then I wish to go abroad."</p> 
<p>After a few more expostulations, the conversation drifted into other channels, but the prince, who had been an attentive listener, thought all this excitement about so small a matter very curious. "There must be more in it than appears," he said to himself.</p> 
<p>"I see the 'poor knight' has come on the scene again," said Evgenie Pavlovitch, stepping to Aglaya's side.</p> 
<p>To the amazement of the prince, who overheard the remark, Aglaya looked haughtily and inquiringly at the questioner, as though she would give him to know, once for all, that there could be no talk between them about the 'poor knight,' and that she did not understand his question.</p> 
<p>"But not now! It is too late to send to town for a Pushkin now. It is much too late, I say!" Colia was exclaiming in a loud voice. "I have told you so at least a hundred times."</p> 
<p>"Yes, it is really much too late to send to town now," said Evgenie Pavlovitch, who had escaped from Aglaya as rapidly as possible. "I am sure the shops are shut in Petersburg; it is past eight o'clock," he added, looking at his watch.</p> 
<p>"We have done without him so far," interrupted Adelaida in her turn. "Surely we can wait until to-morrow."</p> 
<p>"Besides," said Colia, "it is quite unusual, almost improper, for people in our position to take any interest in literature. Ask Evgenie Pavlovitch if I am not right. It is much more fashionable to drive a waggonette with red wheels."</p> 
<p>"You got that from some magazine, Colia," remarked Adelaida.</p> 
<p>"He gets most of his conversation in that way," laughed Evgenie Pavlovitch. "He borrows whole phrases from the reviews. I have long had the pleasure of knowing both Nicholai Ardalionovitch and his conversational methods, but this time he was not repeating something he had read; he was alluding, no doubt, to my yellow waggonette, which has, or had, red wheels. But I have exchanged it, so you are rather behind the times, Colia."</p> 
<p>The prince had been listening attentively to Radomski's words, and thought his manner very pleasant. When Colia chaffed him about his waggonette he had replied with perfect equality and in a friendly fashion. This pleased Muishkin.</p> 
<p>At this moment Vera came up to Lizabetha Prokofievna, carrying several large and beautifully bound books, apparently quite new.</p> 
<p>"What is it?" demanded the lady.</p> 
<p>"This is Pushkin," replied the girl. "Papa told me to offer it to you."</p> 
<p>"What? Impossible!" exclaimed Mrs. Epanchin.</p> 
<p>"Not as a present, not as a present! I should not have taken the liberty," said Lebedeff, appearing suddenly from behind his daughter. "It is our own Pushkin, our family copy, Annenkoff's edition; it could not be bought now. I beg to suggest, with great respect, that your excellency should buy it, and thus quench the noble literary thirst which is consuming you at this moment," he concluded grandiloquently.</p> 
<p>"Oh! if you will sell it, very good--and thank you. You shall not be a loser! But for goodness' sake, don't twist about like that, sir! I have heard of you; they tell me you are a very learned person. We must have a talk one of these days. You will bring me the books yourself?"</p> 
<p>"With the greatest respect ... and ... and veneration," replied Lebedeff, making extraordinary grimaces.</p> 
<p>"Well, bring them, with or without respect, provided always you do not drop them on the way; but on the condition," went on the lady, looking full at him, "that you do not cross my threshold. I do not intend to receive you today. You may send your daughter Vera at once, if you like. I am much pleased with her."</p> 
<p>"Why don't you tell him about them?" said Vera impatiently to her father. "They will come in, whether you announce them or not, and they are beginning to make a row. Lef Nicolaievitch,"--she addressed herself to the prince--"four men are here asking for you. They have waited some time, and are beginning to make a fuss, and papa will not bring them in."</p> 
<p>"Who are these people?" said the prince.</p> 
<p>"They say that they have come on business, and they are the kind of men, who, if you do not see them here, will follow you about the street. It would be better to receive them, and then you will get rid of them. Gavrila Ardalionovitch and Ptitsin are both there, trying to make them hear reason."</p> 
<p>"Pavlicheff's son! It is not worth while!" cried Lebedeff. "There is no necessity to see them, and it would be most unpleasant for your excellency. They do not deserve ..."</p> 
<p>"What? Pavlicheff's son!" cried the prince, much perturbed. "I know ... I know--but I entrusted this matter to Gavrila Ardalionovitch. He told me ..."</p> 
<p>At that moment Gania, accompanied by Ptitsin, came out to the terrace. From an adjoining room came a noise of angry voices, and General Ivolgin, in loud tones, seemed to be trying to shout them down. Colia rushed off at once to investigate the cause of the uproar.</p> 
<p>"This is most interesting!" observed Evgenie Pavlovitch.</p> 
<p>"I expect he knows all about it!" thought the prince.</p> 
<p>"What, the son of Pavlicheff? And who may this son of Pavlicheff be?" asked General Epanchin with surprise; and looking curiously around him, he discovered that he alone had no clue to the mystery. Expectation and suspense were on every face, with the exception of that of the prince, who stood gravely wondering how an affair so entirely personal could have awakened such lively and widespread interest in so short a time.</p> 
<p>Aglaya went up to him with a peculiarly serious look</p> 
<p>"It will be well," she said, "if you put an end to this affair yourself AT ONCE: but you must allow us to be your witnesses. They want to throw mud at you, prince, and you must be triumphantly vindicated. I give you joy beforehand!"</p> 
<p>"And I also wish for justice to be done, once for all," cried Madame Epanchin, "about this impudent claim. Deal with them promptly, prince, and don't spare them! I am sick of hearing about the affair, and many a quarrel I have had in your cause. But I confess I am anxious to see what happens, so do make them come out here, and we will remain. You have heard people talking about it, no doubt?" she added, turning to Prince S.</p> 
<p>"Of course," said he. "I have heard it spoken about at your house, and I am anxious to see these young men!"</p> 
<p>"They are Nihilists, are they not?"</p> 
<p>"No, they are not Nihilists," explained Lebedeff, who seemed much excited. "This is another lot--a special group. According to my nephew they are more advanced even than the Nihilists. You are quite wrong, excellency, if you think that your presence will intimidate them; nothing intimidates them. Educated men, learned men even, are to be found among Nihilists; these go further, in that they are men of action. The movement is, properly speaking, a derivative from Nihilism--though they are only known indirectly, and by hearsay, for they never advertise their doings in the papers. They go straight to the point. For them, it is not a question of showing that Pushkin is stupid, or that Russia must be torn in pieces. No; but if they have a great desire for anything, they believe they have a right to get it even at the cost of the lives, say, of eight persons. They are checked by no obstacles. In fact, prince, I should not advise you ..."</p> 
<p>But Muishkin had risen, and was on his way to open the door for his visitors.</p> 
<p>"You are slandering them, Lebedeff," said he, smiling.</p> 
<p>"You are always thinking about your nephew's conduct. Don't believe him, Lizabetha Prokofievna. I can assure you Gorsky and Daniloff are exceptions--and that these are only ... mistaken. However, I do not care about receiving them here, in public. Excuse me, Lizabetha Prokofievna. They are coming, and you can see them, and then I will take them away. Please come in, gentlemen!"</p> 
<p>Another thought tormented him: He wondered was this an arranged business--arranged to happen when he had guests in his house, and in anticipation of his humiliation rather than of his triumph? But he reproached himself bitterly for such a thought, and felt as if he should die of shame if it were discovered. When his new visitors appeared, he was quite ready to believe himself infinitely less to be respected than any of them.</p> 
<p>Four persons entered, led by General Ivolgin, in a state of great excitement, and talking eloquently.</p> 
<p>"He is for me, undoubtedly!" thought the prince, with a smile. Colia also had joined the party, and was talking with animation to Hippolyte, who listened with a jeering smile on his lips.</p> 
<p>The prince begged the visitors to sit down. They were all so young that it made the proceedings seem even more extraordinary. Ivan Fedorovitch, who really understood nothing of what was going on, felt indignant at the sight of these youths, and would have interfered in some way had it not been for the extreme interest shown by his wife in the affair. He therefore remained, partly through curiosity, partly through good-nature, hoping that his presence might be of some use. But the bow with which General Ivolgin greeted him irritated him anew; he frowned, and decided to be absolutely silent.</p> 
<p>As to the rest, one was a man of thirty, the retired officer, now a boxer, who had been with Rogojin, and in his happier days had given fifteen roubles at a time to beggars. Evidently he had joined the others as a comrade to give them moral, and if necessary material, support. The man who had been spoken of as "Pavlicheff's son," although he gave the name of Antip Burdovsky, was about twenty-two years of age, fair, thin and rather tall. He was remarkable for the poverty, not to say uncleanliness, of his personal appearance: the sleeves of his overcoat were greasy; his dirty waistcoat, buttoned up to his neck, showed not a trace of linen; a filthy black silk scarf, twisted till it resembled a cord, was round his neck, and his hands were unwashed. He looked round with an air of insolent effrontery. His face, covered with pimples, was neither thoughtful nor even contemptuous; it wore an expression of complacent satisfaction in demanding his rights and in being an aggrieved party. His voice trembled, and he spoke so fast, and with such stammerings, that he might have been taken for a foreigner, though the purest Russian blood ran in his veins. Lebedeff's nephew, whom the reader has seen already, accompanied him, and also the youth named Hippolyte Terentieff. The latter was only seventeen or eighteen. He had an intelligent face, though it was usually irritated and fretful in expression. His skeleton-like figure, his ghastly complexion, the brightness of his eyes, and the red spots of colour on his cheeks, betrayed the victim of consumption to the most casual glance. He coughed persistently, and panted for breath; it looked as though he had but a few weeks more to live. He was nearly dead with fatigue, and fell, rather than sat, into a chair. The rest bowed as they came in; and being more or less abashed, put on an air of extreme self-assurance. In short, their attitude was not that which one would have expected in men who professed to despise all trivialities, all foolish mundane conventions, and indeed everything, except their own personal interests.</p> 
<p>"Antip Burdovsky," stuttered the son of Pavlicheff.</p> 
<p>"Vladimir Doktorenko," said Lebedeff's nephew briskly, and with a certain pride, as if he boasted of his name.</p> 
<p>"Keller," murmured the retired officer.</p> 
<p>"Hippolyte Terentieff," cried the last-named, in a shrill voice.</p> 
<p>They sat now in a row facing the prince, and frowned, and played with their caps. All appeared ready to speak, and yet all were silent; the defiant expression on their faces seemed to say, "No, sir, you don't take us in!" It could be felt that the first word spoken by anyone present would bring a torrent of speech from the whole deputation.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>陪同将军来的年轻人２８岁左右，高挑的个子，身材匀称，有一张漂亮而聪明的脸蛋，乌黑的大眼睛目光炯炯，充满着俏皮和嘲弄的神色。阿格拉娅甚至都没有朝他看一眼，继续朗诵着诗，依然正儿八经地只望着公爵一个人，也只面对着他一个人。公爵开始明白，她做这一切是别有用心的。但是起码新来的客人使他多少调整了尴尬的状态。看见他们后，他欠身站起，从远处亲切地向将军点了点头，示意不要打断朗诵，自己则遇到扶手椅后面，左手搁在椅背上继续听着朗诵，这样他就比较自然，不像坐在扶手椅里那样“可笑”了。叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜则用命令式的手势朝进来的人挥了挥手，让他们停在那里。而公爵对于陪同将军来的新客则产生了极大的兴趣，明确地肯定这人是叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇·拉多姆斯基，因为已经听说有不少有关此人的事，也不止一次想到过他。只有他穿的那件便装使他感到困惑，因为他听说，叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇是个军人。在诗朗诵这段时间里这位新客的唇间始终挂着嘲弄的微笑，似乎他已经听说过有关“可怜的骑士”的事儿。</p> 
<p>“也许，这是他自己想出来的名堂，”公爵暗自想道。</p> 
<p>但是阿格拉娅的情况却完全不同。她开始表演朗诵时那种装模作样和刻意夸张的姿态已为严肃认真所掩盖。她已全神贯注于诗歌作品的精神内涵，而且就是以对这种内涵的理解来念出每一个词，以高度的朴实来朗读每一个诗句，因此当朗诵结束的时候，她不仅仅吸引了全体的注意，而且通过表达诗歌的高尚精神仿佛证实了她那么一本正经走到露台中央时竭力显示的装模作样和郑重其事多多少少是正确的。现在可以认为，这种郑重其事的姿态仅仅反映了她对于自己所要表达的那种高尚精神无限的，也许甚至于天真的敬意，她的眼睛闪闪发亮，灵感和欣喜引起的几乎不为人注意的轻微的肌肉抽动数次掠过她那漂亮的脸庞。她朗诵着：</p> 
<p>世上有位可怜的骑士，</p> 
<p>沉默寡言又单纯朴实，</p> 
<p>外表忧郁，脸色苍占，</p> 
<p>精神勇敢，禀性耿直。</p> 
<p>一个不可理喻的幻影，</p> 
<p>在他的眼前紊绕浮现，</p> 
<p>它那魅人的深刻印象，</p> 
<p>深深地嵌入他的心扉。</p> 
<p>从此他的心熊熊燃烧，</p> 
<p>再不对女人瞧上一眼，</p> 
<p>至死对任何一个女人，</p> 
<p>也不想吐露片言只语。</p> 
<p>他在自己的脖颈上面，</p> 
<p>戴上念珠而不是围巾，</p> 
<p>无论在什么人的面前，</p> 
<p>都不掀起脸上的钢罩。</p> 
<p>他充满着纯洁的爱情，</p> 
<p>他忠实于甜美的理想，</p> 
<p>他用自己赤红的鲜血，</p> 
<p>在盾牌上写上Ａ，Ｈ，Ｄ。</p> 
<p>此时在巴勒斯坦荒漠，</p> 
<p>骑士们攀登悬崖峭壁，</p> 
<p>高呼着心上人的芳名，</p> 
<p>跃马驰骋飞奔上战场，</p> 
<p>Ｌｕｍｅｎ ｃｏｅｌｉ，ｓａｎｃｔａ Ｒｏｃａ！＊</p> 
<p>他高声吼叫又狂又烈，</p> 
<p>他的声威如巨雷灌耳，</p> 
<p>使穆斯林们惊魂丧胆。</p> 
<p>他回到遥远的城堡后，</p> 
<p>离群索居囚禁般度日，</p> 
<p>总默默无言、郁郁不乐，</p> 
<p>终如痴如狂命归黄泉。</p> 
<p>＊拉丁文，意为“天国的光明，圣洁的玫瑰”。</p> 
<p>后来公爵回想起这一刻的情景，长久地感到困惑，并且为一个他百思不得其解的问题而苦恼不堪：怎么可以把如此真挚、美好的感情和这种明显的恶意嘲笑结合起来？这是一种嘲弄，对此公爵毫不怀疑；他清楚地理解这一点并且也有理由：在朗诵的时候阿洛拉娅擅自把Ａ。Ｍ。Ｄ。三个字母换成Ｈ。叩。Ｂ。＊他没有弄错，也没有听错，这一点他是没有怀疑的（后来也证实了这一点）。不论怎样，阿格拉娅的举动是有用心的，当然，她是开玩笑，尽管开得过于尖刻和轻率。还是一个月前大家就在议论和笑话的，‘可怜的骑士”。然而不论公爵后来怎么回忆，结果是，阿格拉娅说出这儿个字母不仅没有丝毫开玩笑的样子或是什么讥笑，甚至也没有特别强调这几个字母来突出其隐秘的含意，而是相反，她始终是那么认真、纯洁无暇和天真纯朴地朗诵，以致可以认为这些字母就是诗里的，书上就是这么印的。有一种沉重的和不愉快的感觉刺痛了公爵的心，叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜当然既不明白换了字母也没有发现什么意思，伊万·费奥多罗维奇只知道他们是朗诵诗歌。其余的听众中有很多人是明白的，他们对阿格拉娅的大胆举动和用意感到惊讶，但是都保持沉默，尽量不露声色。但是叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇（公爵甚至准备打赌）不仅仅明白，甚至还竭力要显露出他是明白底蕴的：他那莞尔一笑带有的嘲弄意味太明显了。</p> 
<p>“多么美妙呀！”将军夫人真正陶醉了，朗诵刚一结束便赞叹说，是谁写的诗？”</p> 
<p>“是普希金，妈妈，别让我们丢丑，这有多不好意思！”阿杰莱达高声说。</p> 
<p>“有你们在一起还不至于变得这么笨！”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜苦恼地抢白说，“真羞耻！回去以后，马上把普希金的这首诗给我拿来！”</p> 
<p>“可我们家里好像根本就没有普希金的书。”</p> 
<p>“不知什么时候起，”亚历山德拉补充说，“有两卷脏书搁在那里。”</p> 
<p>“马上派人去城里买，叫费多尔或者阿列克谢去，坐第一班火车，最好是阿列克谢去。阿格拉娅，到这儿来！吻吻我，你朗诵得很出色，但是，如果你是出于真心朗诵这首诗的话，”她几乎是低声耳语着补充说，那么我为你感到惋惜；如果你朗诵是嘲笑他，那么我也不赞成你的这种感情，因此不论怎样，最好是根本别朗诵。你懂吗？去吧，小姐，我以后再跟你说，我们在这里已经坐很久了。”</p> 
<p>＊这是纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜·巴拉什科娃的俄语缩写。</p> 
<p>与此同时，公爵正跟伊万·费奥多罗维奇致意问候，而将军则向他介绍了叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇·拉多姆斯基。</p> 
<p>“是在路上把他抓来的，他刚下火车；他获悉我要来这里，我们一家人都在这里……”</p> 
<p>“我获悉您也在这里，”叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇打断将军的话说，“因为我早就认为一定要寻找机会不仅仅结识您，而且还要得到您的友谊，所以我不想失去时机。您贵体不适？我刚刚才知道……”</p> 
<p>“现在完全好了，我很高兴认识您，久闻大名了，甚至还跟团公爵谈起过您，”列夫·尼古拉耶维奇一边通过手去，一边回答说。</p> 
<p>两人互相客套一番，握了握手，彼此都专注地看了一眼对方。霎那间谈话就变得很一般。公爵发现（他现在会既迅速又急切地发现一切，甚至也许还能注意到根本没有的事），叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇穿的便服使大家产生异常强烈的惊诧，以至所有其他的印象一时都被忘却和磨灭了。可以认为，改换服装包含着某种特别重要的意义。阿杰莱达和亚历山德拉困惑不解地向叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇询问着什么。他的亲戚山公爵甚至大为不安；将军跟他说话则显得很激动。只有阿格拉娅一个人好奇而又十分平静地对叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇打量了一会，仿佛想比较一下，是穿军装还是便服对他更合适，但过了一会她就转开脸，再也不朝他瞧一眼了。叶莉扎维塔·普罗得菲耶夫娜虽然可能有点不安，但是她也什么都不想间。公爵觉得，叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇似乎不受将军夫人的青睐。</p> 
<p>“他使我吃惊，大为惊讶！”伊万·费奥多罗维奇在回答大家提出的问题时反复说，“刚才在彼得堡遇见他时，我简直不敢相信。为什么突然这样改变？真是令人莫测。他可是自己首先高呼不要砸坏椅子的。＊”</p> 
<p>从热烈起来的谈话中可以知道，原来叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇很久很久前就已宣告要退役；但每次他都不是那么当真说的，因此使人不能相信。而且就是讲严肃正经的事，他也总是带着一副开玩笑的样子，叫人怎么也无法弄得清真假，当他自己想叫人分辨不清时，尤其如此。</p> 
<p>“我不过是一时的，就几个月，顶多退役一年，”拉多姆斯基笑着说。</p> 
<p>＊果戈理《钦差大臣》里的话，后用来表示“做过头”的意思。</p> 
<p>“没有任何必要，至少据我对您的事务多少了解的情况来看是这样，”将军仍然很激动。</p> 
<p>“不是要去田庄转转吗，还是您自己建议我；何况我还想去国外……”</p> 
<p>不过话题很快就改变了；但是非常特别的依然继续的不安情绪，在旁观的公爵看来，毕竟失去了分寸，这里一定有什么蹊跷。</p> 
<p>“这么说，“可怜的骑士’又登台了？”叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇走到阿格拉娅眼前问。</p> 
<p>使公爵大为惊诧的是，阿格拉娅困惑不解和疑问地打量着他，好像要他知道，他们之间是不可能谈什么“可怜的骑士”的话的，她甚至不明白他的问话。</p> 
<p>“太晚了，太晚了，现在差人到城里去买普希金的书是太晚了。”科利亚费尽力气与叶莉扎维塔·普罗种菲耶夫娜争辩，“我对您说了三千遍了：太晚了。”</p> 
<p>“是的，现在派人去城里确实太晚了，”叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇立即撇下阿格拉娅，突然凑到这边来说，“我想，彼得堡的店铺也已打烊了，８点多了，”他掏出怀表证实说。</p> 
<p>“多少日子等过去了，也没想起来，等到明天也可以忍耐的，”阿杰莱达加了一句。</p> 
<p>“再说，上流社会的人对文学大感兴趣也不体面，”科利亚补充说，“您问问叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇，对红轮子的黄敞蓬马车感兴趣要体面得多。”</p> 
<p>“您又是从书上看来的，科利亚，”阿杰莱达指出。</p> 
<p>“除了从书上看来的，他不会说别的，”叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇接过话茬说，“他希望整句整句引自评论文章，我早已有幸了解尼古拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇的谈话，但是这次他说的却不是从书本上看来的。尼古拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇显然指的是我那辆红轮于的黄敞蓬马车。只不过我已经将它换了，您说的是过了时的新闻。”</p> 
<p>公爵倾听着拉多姆斯基说的话……他觉得，叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇的举止潇洒，谦逊，活泼，他特别喜欢他对招惹他的科利亚说话所用的那种完全平等和友好的态度。</p> 
<p>“这是什么。”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜问列别杰夫的女儿维拉，她站在将军夫人面前，手里拿着几本书，大开本，装璜精美，几乎还是新的。</p> 
<p>“普希金的书，”维拉说，“我家藏的普希金的书。爸爸吩咐我给您拿来的。”</p> 
<p>“怎么能这样？这怎么可以？”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜很是惊奇。</p> 
<p>“不是作为礼物，不是作为礼物！我不敢！”列别杰夫从女儿身后跳出来说，“照原价便是。这是我家自己的藏书，安年科夫的版本，现在已经找不到这样的了，就照原价让给您。我是怀着敬意献上这些书，愿意卖给您，使将军夫人阁下对文学的崇高感情和高尚的迫不及待心情得到满足。”</p> 
<p>“啊，你要卖，那么就谢谢了，不过，别担心，不会让你吃亏的。只是请别装腔作势，先生。我听说过你，据说，你读了许多书，什么时候来聊聊；你自己把书送到我那里去，是吗？”</p> 
<p>“遵命……恭敬从命！”列别杰夫从女儿那里夺过书，十分满意地装腔作势说。</p> 
<p>“算了，只不过别给我弄丢了，拿来吧，不必恭敬，但是有一个条件，”她专注地打量着他，补充说，“我只许你到门口，今天我不打算接待你。要是差女儿维拉，哪怕现在就去也成，我很喜欢她。”</p> 
<p>“您怎么不说那些人的事？”维拉焦急不堪地对父亲说，“要是这样的话，他们可是会自己闯进来的：已经开始在那里闹了。列夫·尼古拉耶维，”她向已经拿起自己帽子的公爵说，“那里有几个人早就要到您这儿来，有四个人，在我们那里等着骂着，可爸爸却不让他们来见您。”</p> 
<p>“是什么客人。”公爵问。</p> 
<p>“说是有事找您，只不过他们这种人，现在不放他们进来，也会在路上拦住您的。列夫·尼古拉耶维奇，最好还是现在放他们进来，以后就免得麻烦。现在加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维和普季岑在劝说他们，他们不听。”</p> 
<p>“是帕夫利谢夫的儿子！是帕夫利谢夫的儿子！不必睬他们！不必睬他们！”列别杰夫连连挥动双手说，“他们的话也不值一听；最尊敬的公爵阁下，您为了他们伤自己的神也有失体面。就是这样。他们是不配……”</p> 
<p>“帕关利谢夫的儿子！我的上帝！”公爵异常窘困地惊呼起来：“我知道，但是我不是……已经把这件事委托加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇去办了吗？刚才加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇对我说……”</p> 
<p>但是加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维已经从房间里走到露台上来了；普季岑跟在他后面。在最近的上个房间里可以听到喧闹声和伊沃尔享将军的大嗓门，他似乎是想盖过几个嗓子的声音。科利亚立即朝喧闹声那里跑去。</p> 
<p>“这非常有意思！”叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇大声说。</p> 
<p>“这么说，他是知情的！”公爵思忖着。</p> 
<p>“哪个帕夫利谢夫的儿子？……哪来的帕夫利谢夫儿子？”伊万·费奥多罗维奇将军困惑地问。他好奇地打量着大家的脸并惊讶地发现，只有他一个人不知道这一新的事情。</p> 
<p>实际上，在场的人人都很紧张，等待着事态的发展。这件纯属个人的私事竟这般强烈地引起这里所有人的关注，这使公爵深为诧异。</p> 
<p>“如果您马上而且亲自了结这件事的话，这将是很好的，”阿格拉娅带着一副特别严肃的神情走近公爵说，“而且请允许我们做您的见证人。有人想玷污您的名誉，公爵，您应该理直气壮地证明自己是正确的，我先为您感到万分高兴。”</p> 
<p>“我也想最终了结这种卑劣的无理要求，”将军夫人高声嚷道，“公爵，好好教训教训他们，别留情！这件事已听得我耳里嗡嗡直响，为了你我也弄得十分烦恼。不过看一看也挺有趣。把他们叫来，我们坐下。阿格拉娅出的主意很好。您听说这件事什么没有，公爵？”她转向出公爵问。</p> 
<p>“当然听说过，就在你们这儿。但我特别想要瞧瞧这些年轻人，”ω公爵回答说。</p> 
<p>“这就是那些虚无主义者，是吗？”</p> 
<p>“不，他们也不能说是虚无主义者，”列别杰夫跨前一一步说，他也不安得几乎要打哆嗦，“这是另一些特殊的人，我外甥说，他们走得比虚无主义者还远。将军夫人阁下，您以为您在场就能使他们不好意思，这可是枉然，他们不会不好意思的，虚无主义者有时候毕竟是知书达理的，甚至是学者，可这些人走得更远，因为他们首先是实干的人，其实，这是虚无主义的某种后果，但不是通过直接的途径，而是由传闻间接造成的，他们也不是在哪家杂志上发表什么文章宣布自己的主张，而是直接付诸行动；比如，他们不会谈什么普希金毫无意义，也不会议论俄罗斯发解成几部分的必要性；不，他们现在已经理所当然地认为，如果很想做什么事，那么无论什么障碍都不能阻止他们，哪怕干这件事时必须得杀死八个人。所以，公爵，我劝您还是……”</p> 
<p>但是公爵已经走去劝客人们开门了。</p> 
<p>“您在诽谤，列别杰夫，”他微笑着说，“您外甥使您感到非常痛心，叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜，您别信他的。我请您相信，戈尔斯基和达尼洛夫*之流只不过是例外，而这些人仅仅是……弄错了……只是我不想在这里当着大家的面处理这件事。对不起，叶莉扎维塔·普罗得菲耶夫娜，他们就要进来，我让您见一见他们，然而就把他们带开。请吧，先先们。”</p> 
<p>*安戈尔斯基和达尼洛大系十九世纪六十年代两起杀人案的凶手。</p> 
<p>其实更使他不安的是另一个折留人的念头。他模模糊糊感到，这件事会不会是有人暗中事先指使的？就是要在此时此刻，就是要有这些人见证，也许，正是为了等若出他的丑，而不是希望他胜利？但是他又为自己有这种“古怪和恶意的疑心”而感到惆怅忧郁。他觉得，如果有人知道他头脑里有这样的念头，他宁肯死去。在他的新客人进来的那一刻，他真心诚意地愿意把自己看作是他周围所有的人中间道德上最最卑劣的人。</p> 
<p>走进来有五个人，四个是新客人，跟在他们后面的第五个是伊沃尔京将军，他焦躁激动，正在大发言辞。“此人一定是帮我说话的！”公爵脸带微笑想。科利亚跟这些人一起溜了进来，他正跟来访者中的伊波利特热烈地说着话，伊波利特听着，不时冷笑着。</p> 
<p>公爵请客人们坐下。所有这几个人都很年轻，甚至还未成年，因此眼前的事情以及由此而产生的礼仪，实在是很令人惊奇的。比如，伊万·费奥多罗维奇·叶潘钦对这桩“新事情”毫无所知也不甚明白，望着这些黄口小儿，他甚至很愤怒，要不是他夫人对公爵私人的利益表现出出奇的热心，从而抑制了他的发作，否则他一定会以某种方式表示反对的。不过他留下来，部分是出于好奇，部分是出于好心，甚至准备助一臂之力、无论怎么样他的威望还是管用的；但是刚进来的伊沃尔京将军老远就朝他鞠躬又惹得他气乎乎的；他皱眉蹙额，打定主意坚决保持沉默。</p> 
<p>其实，四个年轻来访者中有一人已３０岁左右，是“罗戈任那一伙人中的退役中尉，自己给别人一次就是１５个卢布的拳击手”。可以料想，他是作为其余几人的知心朋友陪他们来。为他们壮胆的，必要时可给他们支持。在那几个人中被称作“帕夫利谢夫的儿子”的那一个处于首要地位并起着首要作用，虽然他自报姓名是安季普·布尔多夫斯基。这是个衣着寒酸、不修边幅的年轻人，礼服上的袖子油光光如镜子一般可以照人，油腻的背心扣子一直扣到上面，衬衫却不知去向，黑色的丝围巾卷成了细带子，油污得无以复加，一双手也久未洗涤，脸上长满粉刺，头发是淡黄色的，目光既天真又无赖，如果可以这样形容的话，他个子不矮，身材消瘦，２２岁左右，他的脸上既没有丝毫的讽刺，也没有半了点儿踌躇；相反流露出完全但然的陶醉于自己拥有的权利的神情，与此同时还显示出必须始终使自己做一个受欺侮的人并觉得自己经常受欺侮，这已到了令人奇怪的地步，他说话很激动，很着急，结结巴巴；仿佛不能完全把词讲出来，就像是个口齿不清的人或者甚至像外国人说话，虽然他是地道的俄罗斯人。</p> 
<p>陪他来的首先是读者已经知道的列别杰夫的外甥，其次是伊波利特。伊波利特还很年轻，１７岁，也许是1８岁左右，他的脸相聪颖，但又经常带着恼火的神情，疾病也在上面留下了可怕的痕迹，他瘦得皮包骨头，肤色蜡黄，眼睛倒闪闪发亮，颧骨上燃着两团红晕。他不停地咳嗽；每讲一个词，每作一欢呼吸几乎总伴有嘶娅的声音。显然肺病已经到了相当厉害的程度。看来，他至多还能活两三个星期。他已经非常劳累，比大家都先要紧坐到椅子上。其余的人进来时还略为客套一下，几乎有点拘谨，是，看起人来却摆出一副架子，显然是怕有失尊严，这跟他们的名声出奇地不相符合，因为他们被看作是否定上流社会所有无用的繁文褥节、世俗偏见的人，除了自身的利益之外，他们几乎否定世上的一切。</p> 
<p>“琴季普·布尔多斯基，”“帕夫利谢夫的儿子”性急和结巴地申报着。</p> 
<p>“弗拉基米尔·多克托连科，”列别杰夫的外甥发音清晰、口齿清楚地自我介绍说，甚至像是在夸耀他是多克托连科。</p> 
<p>“凯勒尔！”退役中尉低低说了一声。</p> 
<p>“伊波利特·捷连季耶夫，”最后一个出入意料地发出了尖声尖气的声音。终于大家在公爵对面的一排椅子上落座，在自我介绍以后，现在大家又立即现出阴郁的脸色，为了振足精神他们把帽子从一只手换到另一只手，大家都准备好了要说话，可是大家又都沉默着，作出一副挑衅的姿态等待着什么，这种样子分明是表示：“不，兄弟，你在撒谎，你蒙骗不了人！”可以感觉到。只要随便什么人说出一个词开个头，马上所有的人便会七嘴入舌、争先恐后一起说起来。</p>
