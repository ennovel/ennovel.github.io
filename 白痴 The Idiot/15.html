<p>"Goodness knows what it means, ma'am," she said. "There is a whole collection of men come--all tipsy--and want to see you. They say that 'it's Rogojin, and she knows all about it.'"</p> 
<p>"It's all right, Katia, let them all in at once."</p> 
<p>"Surely not ALL, ma'am? They seem so disorderly--it's dreadful to see them."</p> 
<p>"Yes ALL, Katia, all--every one of them. Let them in, or they'll come in whether you like or no. Listen! what a noise they are making! Perhaps you are offended, gentlemen, that I should receive such guests in your presence? I am very sorry, and ask your forgiveness, but it cannot be helped--and I should be very grateful if you could all stay and witness this climax. However, just as you please, of course."</p> 
<p>The guests exchanged glances; they were annoyed and bewildered by the episode; but it was clear enough that all this had been pre- arranged and expected by Nastasia Philipovna, and that there was no use in trying to stop her now--for she was little short of insane.</p> 
<p>Besides, they were naturally inquisitive to see what was to happen. There was nobody who would be likely to feel much alarm. There were but two ladies present; one of whom was the lively actress, who was not easily frightened, and the other the silent German beauty who, it turned out, did not understand a word of Russian, and seemed to be as stupid as she was lovely.</p> 
<p>Her acquaintances invited her to their "At Homes" because she was so decorative. She was exhibited to their guests like a valuable picture, or vase, or statue, or firescreen. As for the men, Ptitsin was one of Rogojin's friends; Ferdishenko was as much at home as a fish in the sea, Gania, not yet recovered from his amazement, appeared to be chained to a pillory. The old professor did not in the least understand what was happening; but when he noticed how extremely agitated the mistress of the house, and her friends, seemed, he nearly wept, and trembled with fright: but he would rather have died than leave Nastasia Philipovna at such a crisis, for he loved her as if she were his own granddaughter. Afanasy Ivanovitch greatly disliked having anything to do with the affair, but he was too much interested to leave, in spite of the mad turn things had taken; and a few words that had dropped from the lips of Nastasia puzzled him so much, that he felt he could not go without an explanation. He resolved therefore, to see it out, and to adopt the attitude of silent spectator, as most suited to his dignity. Genera Epanchin alone determined to depart. He was annoyed at the manner in which his gift had been returned, an though he had condescended, under the influence of passion, to place himself on a level with Ptitsin and Ferdishenko, his self-respect and sense of duty now returned together with a consciousness of what was due to his social rank and official importance. In short, he plainly showed his conviction that a man in his position could have nothing to do with Rogojin and his companions. But Nastasia interrupted him at his first words.</p> 
<p>"Ah, general!" she cried, "I was forgetting! If I had only foreseen this unpleasantness! I won't insist on keeping you against your will, although I should have liked you to be beside me now. In any case, I am most grateful to you for your visit, and flattering attention . . . but if you are afraid . . ."</p> 
<p>"Excuse me, Nastasia Philipovna," interrupted the general, with chivalric generosity. "To whom are you speaking? I have remained until now simply because of my devotion to you, and as for danger, I am only afraid that the carpets may be ruined, and the furniture smashed! . . . You should shut the door on the lot, in my opinion. But I confess that I am extremely curious to see how it ends."</p> 
<p>"Rogojin!" announced Ferdishenko.</p> 
<p>"What do you think about it?" said the general in a low voice to Totski. "Is she mad? I mean mad in the medical sense of the word .. . . eh?"</p> 
<p>"I've always said she was predisposed to it," whispered Afanasy Ivanovitch slyly. "Perhaps it is a fever!"</p> 
<p>Since their visit to Gania's home, Rogojin's followers had been increased by two new recruits--a dissolute old man, the hero of some ancient scandal, and a retired sub-lieutenant. A laughable story was told of the former. He possessed, it was said, a set of false teeth, and one day when he wanted money for a drinking orgy, he pawned them, and was never able to reclaim them! The officer appeared to be a rival of the gentleman who was so proud of his fists. He was known to none of Rogojin's followers, but as they passed by the Nevsky, where he stood begging, he had joined their ranks. His claim for the charity he desired seemed based on the fact that in the days of his prosperity he had given away as much as fifteen roubles at a time. The rivals seemed more than a little jealous of one another. The athlete appeared injured at the admission of the "beggar" into the company. By nature taciturn, he now merely growled occasionally like a bear, and glared contemptuously upon the "beggar," who, being somewhat of a man of the world, and a diplomatist, tried to insinuate himself into the bear's good graces. He was a much smaller man than the athlete, and doubtless was conscious that he must tread warily. Gently and without argument he alluded to the advantages of the English style in boxing, and showed himself a firm believer in Western institutions. The athlete's lips curled disdainfully, and without honouring his adversary with a formal denial, he exhibited, as if by accident, that peculiarly Russian object--an enormous fist, clenched, muscular, and covered with red hairs! The sight of this pre-eminently national attribute was enough to convince anybody, without words, that it was a serious matter for those who should happen to come into contact with it.</p> 
<p>None of the band were very drunk, for the leader had kept his intended visit to Nastasia in view all day, and had done his best to prevent his followers from drinking too much. He was sober himself, but the excitement of this chaotic day--the strangest day of his life--had affected him so that he was in a dazed, wild condition, which almost resembled drunkenness.</p> 
<p>He had kept but one idea before him all day, and for that he had worked in an agony of anxiety and a fever of suspense. His lieutenants had worked so hard from five o'clock until eleven, that they actually had collected a hundred thousand roubles for him, but at such terrific expense, that the rate of interest was only mentioned among them in whispers and with bated breath.</p> 
<p>As before, Rogojin walked in advance of his troop, who followed him with mingled self-assertion and timidity. They were specially frightened of Nastasia Philipovna herself, for some reason.</p> 
<p>Many of them expected to be thrown downstairs at once, without further ceremony, the elegant arid irresistible Zaleshoff among them. But the party led by the athlete, without openly showing their hostile intentions, silently nursed contempt and even hatred for Nastasia Philipovna, and marched into her house as they would have marched into an enemy's fortress. Arrived there, the luxury of the rooms seemed to inspire them with a kind of respect, not unmixed with alarm. So many things were entirely new to their experience--the choice furniture, the pictures, the great statue of Venus. They followed their chief into the salon, however, with a kind of impudent curiosity. There, the sight of General Epanchin among the guests, caused many of them to beat a hasty retreat into the adjoining room, the "boxer" and "beggar" being among the first to go. A few only, of whom Lebedeff made one, stood their ground; he had contrived to walk side by side with Rogojin, for he quite understood the importance of a man who had a fortune of a million odd roubles, and who at this moment carried a hundred thousand in his hand. It may be added that the whole company, not excepting Lebedeff, had the vaguest idea of the extent of their powers, and of how far they could safely go. At some moments Lebedeff was sure that right was on their side; at others he tried uneasily to remember various cheering and reassuring articles of the Civil Code.</p> 
<p>Rogojin, when he stepped into the room, and his eyes fell upon Nastasia, stopped short, grew white as a sheet, and stood staring; it was clear that his heart was beating painfully. So he stood, gazing intently, but timidly, for a few seconds. Suddenly, as though bereft of his senses, he moved forward, staggering helplessly, towards the table. On his way he collided against Ptitsin's chair, and put his dirty foot on the lace skirt of the silent lady's dress; but he neither apologized for this, nor even noticed it.</p> 
<p>On reaching the table, he placed upon it a strange-looking object, which he had carried with him into the drawing-room. This was a paper packet, some six or seven inches thick, and eight or nine in length, wrapped in an old newspaper, and tied round three or four times with string.</p> 
<p>Having placed this before her, he stood with drooped arms and head, as though awaiting his sentence.</p> 
<p>His costume was the same as it had been in the morning, except for a new silk handkerchief round his neck, bright green and red, fastened with a huge diamond pin, and an enormous diamond ring on his dirty forefinger.</p> 
<p>Lebedeff stood two or three paces behind his chief; and the rest of the band waited about near the door.</p> 
<p>The two maid-servants were both peeping in, frightened and amazed at this unusual and disorderly scene.</p> 
<p>"What is that?" asked Nastasia Philipovna, gazing intently at Rogojin, and indicating the paper packet.</p> 
<p>"A hundred thousand," replied the latter, almost in a whisper.</p> 
<p>"Oh! so he kept his word--there's a man for you! Well, sit down, please--take that chair. I shall have something to say to you presently. Who are all these with you? The same party? Let them come in and sit down. There's room on that sofa, there are some chairs and there's another sofa! Well, why don't they sit down?"</p> 
<p>Sure enough, some of the brave fellows entirely lost their heads at this point, and retreated into the next room. Others, however, took the hint and sat down, as far as they could from the table, however; feeling braver in proportion to their distance from Nastasia.</p> 
<p>Rogojin took the chair offered him, but he did not sit long; he soon stood up again, and did not reseat himself. Little by little he began to look around him and discern the other guests. Seeing Gania, he smiled venomously and muttered to himself, "Look at that!"</p> 
<p>He gazed at Totski and the general with no apparent confusion, and with very little curiosity. But when he observed that the prince was seated beside Nastasia Philipovna, he could not take his eyes off him for a long while, and was clearly amazed. He could not account for the prince's presence there. It was not in the least surprising that Rogojin should be, at this time, in a more or less delirious condition; for not to speak of the excitements of the day, he had spent the night before in the train, and had not slept more than a wink for forty-eight hours.</p> 
<p>"This, gentlemen, is a hundred thousand roubles," said Nastasia Philipovna, addressing the company in general, "here, in this dirty parcel. This afternoon Rogojin yelled, like a madman, that he would bring me a hundred thousand in the evening, and I have been waiting for him all the while. He was bargaining for me, you know; first he offered me eighteen thousand; then he rose to forty, and then to a hundred thousand. And he has kept his word, see! My goodness, how white he is! All this happened this afternoon, at Gania's. I had gone to pay his mother a visit--my future family, you know! And his sister said to my very face, surely somebody will turn this shameless creature out. After which she spat in her brother Gania's face--a girl of character, that!"</p> 
<p>"Nastasia Philipovna!" began the general, reproachfully. He was beginning to put his own interpretation on the affair.</p> 
<p>"Well, what, general? Not quite good form, eh? Oh, nonsense! Here have I been sitting in my box at the French theatre for the last five years like a statue of inaccessible virtue, and kept out of the way of all admirers, like a silly little idiot! Now, there's this man, who comes and pays down his hundred thousand on the table, before you all, in spite of my five years of innocence and proud virtue, and I dare be sworn he has his sledge outside waiting to carry me off. He values me at a hundred thousand! I see you are still angry with me, Gania! Why, surely you never really wished to take ME into your family? ME, Rogojin's mistress! What did the prince say just now?"</p> 
<p>"I never said you were Rogojin's mistress--you are NOT!" said the prince, in trembling accents.</p> 
<p>"Nastasia Philipovna, dear soul!" cried the actress, impatiently, "do be calm, dear! If it annoys you so--all this--do go away and rest! Of course you would never go with this wretched fellow, in spite of his hundred thousand roubles! Take his money and kick him out of the house; that's the way to treat him and the likes of him! Upon my word, if it were my business, I'd soon clear them all out!"</p> 
<p>The actress was a kind-hearted woman, and highly impressionable. She was very angry now.</p> 
<p>"Don't be cross, Daria Alexeyevna!" laughed Nastasia. "I was not angry when I spoke; I wasn't reproaching Gania. I don't know how it was that I ever could have indulged the whim of entering an honest family like his. I saw his mother--and kissed her hand, too. I came and stirred up all that fuss, Gania, this afternoon, on purpose to see how much you could swallow--you surprised me, my friend--you did, indeed. Surely you could not marry a woman who accepts pearls like those you knew the general was going to give me, on the very eve of her marriage? And Rogojin! Why, in your own house and before your own brother and sister, he bargained with me! Yet you could come here and expect to be betrothed to me before you left the house! You almost brought your sister, too. Surely what Rogojin said about you is not really true: that you would crawl all the way to the other end of the town, on hands and knees, for three roubles?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, he would!" said Rogojin, quietly, but with an air of absolute conviction.</p> 
<p>"H'm! and he receives a good salary, I'm told. Well, what should you get but disgrace and misery if you took a wife you hated into your family (for I know very well that you do hate me)? No, no! I believe now that a man like you would murder anyone for money-- sharpen a razor and come up behind his best friend and cut his throat like a sheep--I've read of such people. Everyone seems money-mad nowadays. No, no! I may be shameless, but you are far worse. I don't say a word about that other--"</p> 
<p>"Nastasia Philipovna, is this really you? You, once so refined and delicate of speech. Oh, what a tongue! What dreadful things you are saying," cried the general, wringing his hands in real grief.</p> 
<p>"I am intoxicated, general. I am having a day out, you know--it's my birthday! I have long looked forward to this happy occasion. Daria Alexeyevna, you see that nosegay-man, that Monsieur aux Camelias, sitting there laughing at us?"</p> 
<p>"I am not laughing, Nastasia Philipovna; I am only listening with all my attention," said Totski, with dignity.</p> 
<p>"Well, why have I worried him, for five years, and never let him go free? Is he worth it? He is only just what he ought to be-- nothing particular. He thinks I am to blame, too. He gave me my education, kept me like a countess. Money--my word! What a lot of money he spent over me! And he tried to find me an honest husband first, and then this Gania, here. And what do you think? All these five years I did not live with him, and yet I took his money, and considered I was quite justified.</p> 
<p>"You say, take the hundred thousand and kick that man out. It is true, it is an abominable business, as you say. I might have married long ago, not Gania--Oh, no!--but that would have been abominable too.</p> 
<p>"Would you believe it, I had some thoughts of marrying Totski, four years ago! I meant mischief, I confess--but I could have had him, I give you my word; he asked me himself. But I thought, no! it's not worthwhile to take such advantage of him. No! I had better go on to the streets, or accept Rogojin, or become a washerwoman or something--for I have nothing of my own, you know. I shall go away and leave everything behind, to the last rag--he shall have it all back. And who would take me without anything? Ask Gania, there, whether he would. Why, even Ferdishenko wouldn't have me!"</p> 
<p>"No, Ferdishenko would not; he is a candid fellow, Nastasia Philipovna," said that worthy. "But the prince would. You sit here making complaints, but just look at the prince. I've been observing him for a long while."</p> 
<p>Nastasia Philipovna looked keenly round at the prince.</p> 
<p>"Is that true?" she asked.</p> 
<p>"Quite true," whispered the prince.</p> 
<p>"You'll take me as I am, with nothing?"</p> 
<p>"I will, Nastasia Philipovna."</p> 
<p>"Here's a pretty business!" cried the general. "However, it might have been expected of him."</p> 
<p>The prince continued to regard Nastasia with a sorrowful, but intent and piercing, gaze.</p> 
<p>"Here's another alternative for me," said Nastasia, turning once more to the actress; "and he does it out of pure kindness of heart. I know him. I've found a benefactor. Perhaps, though, what they say about him may be true--that he's an--we know what. And what shall you live on, if you are really so madly in love with Rogojin's mistress, that you are ready to marry her --eh?"</p> 
<p>"I take you as a good, honest woman, Nastasia Philipovna--not as Rogojin's mistress."</p> 
<p>"Who? I?--good and honest?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, you."</p> 
<p>"Oh, you get those ideas out of novels, you know. Times are changed now, dear prince; the world sees things as they really are. That's all nonsense. Besides, how can you marry? You need a nurse, not a wife."</p> 
<p>The prince rose and began to speak in a trembling, timid tone, but with the air of a man absolutely sure of the truth of his words.</p> 
<p>"I know nothing, Nastasia Philipovna. I have seen nothing. You are right so far; but I consider that you would be honouring me, and not I you. I am a nobody. You have suffered, you have passed through hell and emerged pure, and that is very much. Why do you shame yourself by desiring to go with Rogojin? You are delirious. You have returned to Mr. Totski his seventy-five thousand roubles, and declared that you will leave this house and all that is in it, which is a line of conduct that not one person here would imitate. Nastasia Philipovna, I love you! I would die for you. I shall never let any man say one word against you, Nastasia Philipovna! and if we are poor, I can work for both."</p> 
<p>As the prince spoke these last words a titter was heard from Ferdishenko; Lebedeff laughed too. The general grunted with irritation; Ptitsin and Totski barely restrained their smiles. The rest all sat listening, open-mouthed with wonder.</p> 
<p>"But perhaps we shall not be poor; we may be very rich, Nastasia Philipovna." continued the prince, in the same timid, quivering tones. "I don't know for certain, and I'm sorry to say I haven't had an opportunity of finding out all day; but I received a letter from Moscow, while I was in Switzerland, from a Mr. Salaskin, and he acquaints me with the fact that I am entitled to a very large inheritance. This letter--"</p> 
<p>The prince pulled a letter out of his pocket.</p> 
<p>"Is he raving?" said the general. "Are we really in a mad-house?"</p> 
<p>There was silence for a moment. Then Ptitsin spoke.</p> 
<p>"I think you said, prince, that your letter was from Salaskin? Salaskin is a very eminent man, indeed, in his own world; he is a wonderfully clever solicitor, and if he really tells you this, I think you may be pretty sure that he is right. It so happens, luckily, that I know his handwriting, for I have lately had business with him. If you would allow me to see it, I should perhaps be able to tell you."</p> 
<p>The prince held out the letter silently, but with a shaking hand.</p> 
<p>"What, what?" said the general, much agitated.</p> 
<p>"What's all this? Is he really heir to anything?"</p> 
<p>All present concentrated their attention upon Ptitsin, reading the prince's letter. The general curiosity had received a new fillip. Ferdishenko could not sit still. Rogojin fixed his eyes first on the prince, and then on Ptitsin, and then back again; he was extremely agitated. Lebedeff could not stand it. He crept up and read over Ptitsin's shoulder, with the air of a naughty boy who expects a box on the ear every moment for his indiscretion.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>女仆卡佳非常惊慌地走了进来。</p> 
<p>“那里天知道是怎么回事，纳斯塔西娜·费利帕夫娜，闯进来十人样子，全都醉醺醺的，要到这儿来，说是罗戈任，还说您本人认识他的。”“确实，卡佳，马上就放他们大家进来。”</p> 
<p>“难道……放所有的人，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜？全是些不成体统的人。很不像样！”</p> 
<p>“把所有的人都放进来，所有的人都放，卡佳，别害怕，把所有的人一个不剩地放进来，否则他们不管你也还是会进来的。瞧他们闹嚷嚷的，就像刚才一样。诸位，你们也许在见怪了，”她转向客人们说，“当着你们的面，我竟接待这么一伙人。我很遗憾、请你们原谅，但又必须这样，而我又非常非常希望你们在这场戏结局的时候同意当我的见证人，不过，这得由你们。”</p> 
<p>客人们继续惊讶不已，交头接耳，相互使着眼色，但是已经完全明白，这一切是事先打算和安排好的，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜当然是完全失去了理智，可是现在也无法让她回心转意。大家都为好奇心苦苦折蘑着。同时也没有人特别害怕。在座的只有两位女宾：达里娅·阿列克谢耶夫娜，这是个活络的、见过各种世面、很难使她困窘的女士，还有一位很漂亮但沉默寡语的陌生女士，但是，默不作声的陌生女士也未必能理解什么，因为她是外来的德国人，一点也不使俄语，此外，好像她有多美就有多蠢。她初来乍到，可是邀请她参加某些晚会已经成了惯例，她则穿上最华丽的服装，头发梳得像阵列一样，然后把她当一幅美丽的画似的安置在席间以点缀晚会，就像有些人为了在自己家里举办晚会而向熟人借一幅画，一只花瓶，一尊雕像或一座屏风用一次一样。至于说到男人，那么，比方说普季岑，他是罗戈任的好朋友；费尔迪先科则是如鱼得水；加涅奇卡仍还没有恢复常态，虽然他神志恍惚，可是却不可遏制地感到有一种炽烈的需要，要在自己的耻辱柱旁站到底；教师老头弄不清楚事情的原委，对纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜犹如对自己孙女一般宠爱，当他发觉周围以及她身上表现出的非同寻常的惊惶不安时，真的吓得打起颤来，差点要哭出来；但是这种时刻要他丢下她，莫如要他去死。至于说阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇，当然，在这类奇遇中他是不能让自己的名誉受到损害的，但是尽管这件事来了这么一个令人发狂的转变，与他实在是戚戚相关的；再说纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜口中掉出的两三句话就是有关他的，因此不彻底搞清楚事情，无论如何是不能离开的。他决定奉陪到底，而且绝对保持沉默，只作旁观者，当然，这是他的尊严要求这样做的。只有叶潘钦将军一人，在此之前刚刚因为纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜用不客气和可笑的方式还给他礼物而感到莫大的难堪，现在当然为这种不同寻常的咄咄怪事，或者，比方说，为罗戈任的出现而更加生气。况且像他这样的人肯与亚季岑、费尔迪先科坐在一起，已经够屈尊俯就了；但是强烈的情感力量所能做到的，最终则可能被责任感、被义务、官衔、地位的意识，总的来说，被自尊心所战胜。因此，将军阁下在场的情况下，无论如何是不能放罗戈任一伙进来的。</p> 
<p>他刚刚向纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜申明这一点，她马上就打断他说，“啊，将军，我竟忘了！但请您相信，我早就料到您会这样，虽然我很希望正是现在能在自己身边看见您，但既然您这么见怪，我也就不坚持，不留您了。不论怎么样，我很感激您与我结交，感激您对我的抬举和关注，但是既然您怕……”</p> 
<p>“请问，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜，”将军在骑士慷慨大度精神的冲动下高声说道，“您这是对谁说话？光凭对您的忠诚，我现在也要留在您身边，比如，要是有什么危险……况且，坦白地说，我也十分好奇，我刚才只是想提醒，他们会弄坏地毯，也许，还会砸碎什么东西……所以，照我看，根本就不必放他们进来，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜！”</p> 
<p>“罗戈任本人到！”费尔迪先科宣布说。</p> 
<p>“阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇，您怎么想，”将军勿匆对他低语说，“她是不是发疯了？也就是说，这不是讽喻，而是照真正医学的说法、啊？”</p> 
<p>“我以对您说过，她常常喜欢这样，”阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇狡黠地低声回答说。</p> 
<p>“而且还很激狂……”</p> 
<p>罗戈任一伙几乎还是早晨那一班人马：只增加了一个不务正业的老家伙，当初他曾经是一张揭露隐私的淫猥小报的编辑，有一件轶事曾经讲到过他，说他把所镶的金牙拿去当了，买了酒喝；还有一名退伍少尉，就其职业和使命来说肯定是早晨那个拳头先生的对手和竞争者，他根本不认识罗戈任一伙中的任何人，而是在涅瓦大街向阳这边街上搭上来的，他在那里拦截行人，用马尔林斯基的词语请求救济，还有一个狡猾的借口，说什么他自己“当年给乞讨者一次就是１５卢布”。两个竞争者立即互相采取敌视态度。在接自“乞对者”入伙后，原来那个拳头先生甚至认为自己受到了侮辱，他生性寡言少语。有时只会像熊一样发威吼叫，并以深深的蔑视看待“乞讨者”对他自己结奉承和讨好献媚，而少尉原来还是个善于待人接物的上流社会的人。从外表看，他更希望以机智灵巧而不是靠用强力来取胜，况且他的个子也比拳头先生要低一截。他很温和，从不参与公开争论，但是拼命自我吹嘘，已有好几次提到英国式拳击的优越性，总之是个纯粹的西方派。拳头先生在回到“拳击”这个字眼时只是轻蔑和气恼地冷笑着，从他这方面来说，也不屑与对手公开辩论，有时则默默地，仿佛无意似地出示，或者最好是说，伸出一个硕大的拳头-- 地道的民族玩意，那上面青筋累累，骨节粗大，长满一层红棕色的茸毛，于是大家便明白了，如果这个十足民族性的玩意命中目标的话，那么真的只有变成肉酱了。</p> 
<p>他们这伙人，就像下午那样，没有那一个是完全“醉了”的，这是罗戈任亲自努力的结果，因为这一整天他考虑的就是拜访纳斯塔西娅·费利帕多娜的事，他自己倒几乎已经完全清醒了，但是这乱哄哄的，与他一生度过的日子丝毫不相像的一天里所经受的印象，又几乎要把他搞糊涂了。只有一个事每一分钟，每一瞬间他都念念不忘，记在脑海里，留在心坎间。为了这个事他花去了从下午５点直至１１点的全部时间，怀着无穷的烦恼和焦虑，跟金杰尔和比斯库普之流周旋，弄得他们也发了狂似的，为满足他的需要而拼看奔波。但是，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜用嘲笑的口吻完全不明确地顺口提至的１０万卢布终究凑齐了，要付利息，这一点甚至比斯库普本人也因为不好意思大声说，而只是跟金杰尔悄声细语。</p> 
<p>像下午那样，罗戈任走在众人前面，其余的人跟在他后面，虽然他们意识到自己的优势，但仍然有些畏怯。天知道是为什么，他们主要是怕纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜。他们中有些人甚至以为，马上就会把他们所有人“从楼梯上推下去”。顺便说，这么想的人中也有穿着讲究的风流情郎扎廖热夫。但其他的人，特别是拳头先生，虽然没有讲出声，可是在心里却是以极为轻蔑甚至敌视的态度对待纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的，他们到她这儿来就像来围攻城池一般。但是他们经过的头两个房间陈设的富丽堂皇、他们示曾听说、未曾见过的东西、罕见的家具、图画、巨大的维纳斯塑像，所有这一切都给他们产生令人倾倒和肃然起敬的印象，甚至还有几分恐惧。当然，这并不妨碍他们大家渐渐地不顾恐惧心理而以一种厚颜无耻的好奇跟在罗戈任后面挤进客厅；但是当拳头先生，“乞讨者”和另外几个人发现在宾客中有叶潘钦将军时，霎那间便慌得不知所措，甚至开始稍稍后缩，退向另一个房间。只有列别杰夫一个人算是最有精神、最有自信的人，他几乎与罗戈任并排大模大样地朝前走，因为他明白，１４０万家财以及此刻捧在手中的１０万卢布实际上意味着什么。不过，应该指出，所有他们这些人，连行家列别杰夫也不例外，在认识自己威力的极限方面都有点迷糊，他们现在真的什么都能干，还是不行？有时候列别杰夫准备发誓说什么都能干，但有时却提心吊胆地感到需要暗自借助法典中的某些条款，特别是那些能鼓舞人和安慰人的条款，以防万一。</p> 
<p>纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的客厅给罗戈任本人产生的印象与他所有的同伴截然不同。门帘刚卷起，他就看见了纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜，其余的一切对他来说便不复存在，就像早晨那样，这种感觉甚至比早晨更强烈。他的脸色一下子变白了，刹时间停下来；可以猜得到，他的心扑通扑通跳得厉害。他目不转睛，胆怯而茫然地盯着纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜。突然，他仿佛失去了全部理智，几乎是摇摇晃晃地走近桌子；半路上绊了一下普季岑坐着的椅子，肮脏的靴子还踩上了默默无语的德国美人华丽的浅蓝色裙子的花边；他没有道歉，也没有发觉。当他走到桌子跟前时，便把走进客厅时用双手捧在自己面前的一包奇怪的东西放到桌上，这是一个大纸包，高三俄寸，长四俄寸、用一张《交易所公报》包得严严实实，用绳子从四面扎得紧紧的，还交叉捆了两道，就像捆扎园锥形的大糖块一样。然后，一言不发地垂下双手站在那里，仿佛等候自己的判决似的。他穿的还是刚才那身衣服，除了脖子上围了一条翠绿与红色相间的全新的丝围巾，还佩戴一枚形如甲虫的钻石大别针，右手肮脏的手指上戴着一只硕大的钻石戒。列别杰夫走到离桌子三步远的地方；其余的人，如前面说的，渐渐地聚到了客厅里。纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的仆人卡佳和帕莎怀着极度的惊讶和恐惧跑来从卷起的门帘那里张望着。</p> 
<p>“这是什么？”纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜好奇地凝神打量着罗戈任并用目光指着那包东西问。</p> 
<p>“１０万卢布！”对方几乎喃喃着说。</p> 
<p>“啊，你倒是说话算数的，好样的！请坐，就这里，就这张椅子；等会我还有活要对您说。跟您一起来的还有谁？刚才的原班人马吗？好吧，让他们进来坐吧；那边沙发上可以坐，还有沙发。那里有两把扶手椅……他们怎么啦，不想坐还是怎么的？”</p> 
<p>确实，有些人真正是局促不安，退了出去，在另一个房间里坐下等着，但有些人留了下来，按主人所请各自坐了下来，但只是离桌子稍远些，大多坐在角落里；一些人仍然想稍稍收敛一下，另一些人则越来越亢奋，而且快活得似乎有点不自然。罗戈任也坐到指给他的椅子上，但坐的时间不长，很快就站了起来，已经再也不坐下去了。渐渐地，他开始辨认和打量起客人们来。看见了加尼亚，他恶狠狠地阴笑了一下，自言自语地咕哝着：“瞧这德性！”对于将军和阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇，他毫不困窘、甚至也不特别好奇地瞥了一眼。但是，当他发现纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜身旁的公爵时，则长久地没把目光从他身上移开，感到万分惊讶，似乎对在这里见到他难以理解。可以怀疑，他有时候神智不清。除了这一天受到的一切震惊，昨天整夜他是在火车上度过的，几乎已有两昼夜没睡了。</p> 
<p>“诸位，这是１０万卢布，”纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜用一种狂热的迫不及待的挑战口吻对大家说，“就在这个肮脏的纸包里，刚才就是他像疯子一般嚷着晚上要给我送来１０万卢布，我一直在等着他，他这里要买找：开始是１万８千，后来突然一下子跳到４万，再后来就是这１０万。他倒是说话算数的！嘿，他的脸色有多苍白！……这一切全是刚才在加尼亚家发生的：我去拜访他妈妈、拜访我未来的家庭，而在那里他妹妹当面对我喊道：‘难道没有人把这个不知羞耻的女人从这里赶走！’，并对她兄长加涅奇卡的脸上还呻了一口。真是个有性格的姑娘！”</p> 
<p>“纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜！”将军责备地叫了一声。</p> 
<p>他按照自己的理解，开始有点明白是怎么回事。</p> 
<p>“怎么啦，将军？不体面，是吗？算了，装腔作势够了！我像个高不可攀、端庄贞洁的闺阁千金坐在法国剧院的包厢里，这算什么！还有，五年来我如野人似的躲避所有追逐我的人，像一个纯洁无暇的高傲公主去看待他们，这种愚蠢一直折磨着我！现在，就在你们面前，来了个人并且把１０万卢布放到桌子上，那是在我洁身无暇五年之后，他们大概已经有三驾马车在等我了。原来他认为我值１０万！加涅奇卡，我看得出来，您到现在还在生我气，是吗？难道你想把我带进你的家吗？把我，罗戈任的女人带去？公爵刚才说什么来着？”</p> 
<p>“我没有那样说，没有说您是罗戈任的女人，您不是罗戈任的人。”公爵用发颤的声音说。</p> 
<p>“纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜，够了，我的姑奶奶，够了，亲爱的，”突然达里娅·阿列克谢耶夫娜忍不住说，“既然您因为他们而感到这么难受，那么还睬他干什么！尽管他出１０万，难道你真想跟这样的人走！确实，１０万--可真够意思的！你就收这１０万卢布，然后把他赶走，就该对他这样；唉，我要是处在你的地位就把他们统统……就是这么回事！”</p> 
<p>“达里娅·阿列克谢耶夫娜甚至怒气冲冲。这是个善良和相当易动感情的女人。</p> 
<p>“别生气，达里娅·阿列克谢耶夫娜，”纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜朝她苦笑一下说，“我可不是生气才这么说的。难道我责备他了吗？连我也真的不明白，我怎么这么犯傻，竟想进入正派人家。我见到了他的母亲，吻了她的手。而且刚才我干吗在你家要嘲弄你家要嘲弄你们呢，加涅奇卡，因为我故意想最后一次看看：你本人究竟会走到哪一步？嘿，你真使我惊讶，真的。我期待过许多，却没有料到这一点！当你知道，在你结婚前夕他送了我这样的珍珠，而我也收下了，难道你还会要我？那么罗戈任呢？他可是在你的家里，当着你母亲和妹妹的面出价钱买我的，而在这以后你竟还来求婚，甚至还差点把妹妹带来？罗戈任曾经说你为了３卢布会爬到瓦西利耶夫斯基岛去，难道果真这样？”</p> 
<p>“会爬的，”罗戈任突然轻轻说，但是显出极大的自信的样子。</p> 
<p>“你若是饿得要死倒也罢了，可你，据说薪俸收入不错！这一切之外，除了耻辱，还要把可憎恨的妻子带进家！（因为你是憎恨我的，我知道这一点！）不，现在我相信，这样的人为了钱会杀人的！现在这样的贪婪可是会使所有的人都利令智昏的，使他们都迷上了金钱，以致人都仿佛变傻了，自己还是个孩子，可已经拼命想当放高利贷的！要不就像我不久前读到的那样，用一块绸包在剃刀上，扎牢，然后悄悄地从后面把好朋友像羊一般宰了。嘿，你真是个不知羞耻的人！我是不知羞耻，可你更坏。至于那个送鲜花的人我就不说了……”</p> 
<p>“这是您吗，是您吗？纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜！”将军真正觉得伤心，双手一拍说，“您本是多么温婉，思想多么细腻的人，瞧现在！用的是什么样的语言！什么样的字眼！”</p> 
<p>“将军，我现在醉了。”纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜突然笑了起来，“我想玩玩！今天是我的生日，我的假日，我的闰日，我早就期待着这一天了。达利娅·阿列克谢耶夫娜，你看见眼前这个送花人，这个Ｍｏｎａｉｅｕｒ ａｕｘ Ｃａｍｅｌｉａｓ＊吗，瞧他坐着还嘲笑我们呢……”</p> 
<p>“我不在笑，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜，我只是非常用心在听，”托茨基一本正经地回了一句。</p> 
<p>“好吧，就说说他吧，为了什么我要折磨他整整五年，不把他放走？他值得那样！他就是这样的人，也应该是这样的人……他还认为我是对不起他的，因为他给了我教育，像伯爵夫人那样养着我，钱嘛，钱嘛花了不知多少，在那里替我找了个正派的丈夫，而在这里则找了加涅奇卡；不论你怎么想：我跟他这五年没有同居，但钱是拿他的，而且我认为是拿得对的！我可真把自已搞糊涂了！你刚才说，既然那么令人厌恶，就把］０万卢布收下，然后赶他走。说令人厌恶，这是真的……我本来早就可以嫁人了，但也不是嫁给加涅奇卡，可是也是让人厌恶的。为了什么我让五年光阴流失在这种愤恨之中！你信不信，四年前，我有时候想过，是不是索性嫁给阿法纳西·伊万诺维奇算了？当时我是怀着一种怨愤这么想的；我那时头脑里想过的念头还少吗；真的，我能逼得他这样做的！他自己曾经死乞白赖地要求过，信不信？确实，他是撒谎，可是他也很好色，他会顶不住的。后来，感谢上帝，我想道：他是只配愤恨的！这一来当时我突然对他感到很厌恶，如果他自己来求婚，我也不会嫁给他，整整五年我就这样装样子的！不，最好还是到马路上去，那里才是我该呆的地方，或者就跟罗戈任去纵情作乐，或者明天就去当洗衣工！因为我身上没有一样自己的东西；我要走的话，就把一切都扔还给他，连最后一件衣服都留下，而一无所有了，谁还会要我，你倒问问加尼亚，他还要不要？连费尔迪先科也不会要我！……”</p> 
<p>“费尔迪先生大概是不会要的，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜，我是个开诚布公的人，”费尔迪先科打断说，“可是公爵会要的！您就只是坐着抱怨，您倒看看公爵！我已经观察很久了……”</p> 
<p>纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜好奇地转向公爵。</p> 
<p>“真的吗？”她问。</p> 
<p>“真的，”公爵轻轻说。</p> 
<p>＊法语：茶花男。</p> 
<p>“那就要吧，光身一个，一无所有！”</p> 
<p>“我要，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜……”</p> 
<p>“这可是件新的奇闻！”将军喃喃着说，“可以料到的。”</p> 
<p>公爵用悲郁、严峻和动人的目光望着继续在打量他的纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的脸。</p> 
<p>“这还真找到了！”她又转向达里娅·阿列克谢耶夫娜，突然说，“他倒真的是出于好心，我了解他。我找到了一个善心人！不过，也许人家说得对，说他是……那个。既然你这么钟情，要一个罗戈任的女人，你靠什么来养活自己，养活一个公爵吗？……”</p> 
<p>“我娶您是娶一个正派女人，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜，而不是娶罗戈任的女人，”公爵说。</p> 
<p>“你是说我是正派女人？”</p> 
<p>“是您。”</p> 
<p>“嗬，这从小说那里看来的……！公爵，亲爱的，这已经是过了时的妄言了，如今世界变聪明了，这一切也就成了无稽之谈了！再说，你怎么结婚，你自己还需要有个保姆呢！”</p> 
<p>“我什么都不知道，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜，我什么世面也没见过，您说得对，但是我……我认为，是您将使我而不是我将使您获得名誉。我是个无足轻重的人，而您受过许多痛苦，并从这样的地狱里走出来却纯洁无暇，这是很不简单的。您何必感到羞愧，还想跟罗戈任走？这是狂热……您把７万卢布还给了托茨基先生，并且说这里所有的一切，您全要抛弃，这里是谁也做不到这一点的。我……爱……您，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕大娜。我要为您而死，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜，我不许任何人讲您的一句坏话，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜……如果我们穷，我会去工作的，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜……”</p> 
<p>在公爵讲最后几句话时，可以听到费尔迪先科、列别杰夫发出的嘻嘻窃笑，连将军也不知怎么很不满意地暗自咳了一声。普季岑和托茨基无法不笑，但克制住了。其余的人简直惊讶得张大了嘴。</p> 
<p>“……但是，我们也许不会贫穷，而会很富有，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜，”公爵依然用胆怯的声音继续说，“不过，我还不能肯定，遗憾的是，一整天了，到目前为止我还什么都没能打听到，但我在瑞士收到了一位萨拉兹金先生从莫斯科寄来的信，他通知我，似乎我能得到很大一笔遗产。就是这封信。”</p> 
<p>公爵真的从口袋里掏出了信。</p> 
<p>“他不是在说胡话吧？”将军咕哝着说，“简直就是一所真正的疯人院！”</p> 
<p>接下来有一瞬间是沉默。</p> 
<p>“您，公爵，好像说，是萨拉兹金给您写的信？”普季岑问，“这在他那个圈子里是很有名的人，这是个很有名的事务代理人，如果确实是他。通知您、那您完全可以相信的。所幸我认得他的签字，因为不久前我跟他打过交道……如果您给我看一下，也许，我能告诉您什么。”</p> 
<p>公爵颤动着双手，默默地递给他信件。</p> 
<p>“是怎么回事？怎么回事？”将军豁然大悟，像个疯子似的望着大家，“难道真有遗产吗？”</p> 
<p>大家都把目光盯着正在看信的普季岑身上。大家的好奇心增添了新的强大的推动力：费尔迪先科坐不住了；罗戈任困惑不解地望着，很不放心地把目光一会儿投向公爵，一会又移到普季岑身上。达里娅·阿列克谢耶夫娜如坐针毡般地等待着。连列别杰夫也忍不住了，从他坐着的角落里走出来，把身子弯得低低的，从普季岑肩后探看着信件，他那副样子就像担心人家为此而给他一拳似的：</p>
