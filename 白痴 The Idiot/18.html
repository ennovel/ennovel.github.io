The Epanchins had a luxurious country-house at Pavlofsk, [One of the fashionable summer resorts near St. Petersburg.] and to this spot Mrs. Epanchin determined to proceed without further delay. In a couple of days all was ready, and the family had left town. A day or two after this removal to Pavlofsk, Prince Muishkin arrived in St. Petersburg by the morning train from Moscow. No one met him; but, as he stepped out of the carriage, he suddenly became aware of two strangely glowing eyes fixed upon him from among the crowd that met the train. On endeavouring to re-discover the eyes, and see to whom they belonged, he could find nothing to guide him. It must have been a hallucination. But the disagreeable impression remained, and without this, the prince was sad and thoughtful already, and seemed to be much preoccupied.</p> 
<p>His cab took him to a small and bad hotel near the Litaynaya. Here he engaged a couple of rooms, dark and badly furnished. He washed and changed, and hurriedly left the hotel again, as though anxious to waste no time. Anyone who now saw him for the first time since he left Petersburg would judge that he had improved vastly so far as his exterior was concerned. His clothes certainly were very different; they were more fashionable, perhaps even too much so, and anyone inclined to mockery might have found something to smile at in his appearance. But what is there that people will not smile at?</p> 
<p>The prince took a cab and drove to a street near the Nativity, where he soon discovered the house he was seeking. It was a small wooden villa, and he was struck by its attractive and clean appearance; it stood in a pleasant little garden, full of flowers. The windows looking on the street were open, and the sound of a voice, reading aloud or making a speech, came through them. It rose at times to a shout, and was interrupted occasionally by bursts of laughter.</p> 
<p>Prince Muishkin entered the court-yard, and ascended the steps. A cook with her sleeves turned up to the elbows opened the door. The visitor asked if Mr. Lebedeff were at home.</p> 
<p>"He is in there," said she, pointing to the salon.</p> 
<p>The room had a blue wall-paper, and was well, almost pretentiously, furnished, with its round table, its divan, and its bronze clock under a glass shade. There was a narrow pier- glass against the wall, and a chandelier adorned with lustres hung by a bronze chain from the ceiling.</p> 
<p>When the prince entered, Lebedeff was standing in the middle of the room, his back to the door. He was in his shirt-sleeves, on account of the extreme heat, and he seemed to have just reached the peroration of his speech, and was impressively beating his breast.</p> 
<p>His audience consisted of a youth of about fifteen years of age with a clever face, who had a book in his hand, though he was not reading; a young lady of twenty, in deep mourning, stood near him with an infant in her arms; another girl of thirteen, also in black, was laughing loudly, her mouth wide open; and on the sofa lay a handsome young man, with black hair and eyes, and a suspicion of beard and whiskers. He frequently interrupted the speaker and argued with him, to the great delight of the others.</p> 
<p>"Lukian Timofeyovitch! Lukian Timofeyovitch! Here's someone to see you! Look here! . . . a gentleman to speak to you! . . . Well, it's not my fault!" and the cook turned and went away red with anger.</p> 
<p>Lebedeff started, and at sight of the prince stood like a statue for a moment. Then he moved up to him with an ingratiating smile, but stopped short again.</p> 
<p>"Prince! ex-ex-excellency!" he stammered. Then suddenly he ran towards the girl with the infant, a movement so unexpected by her that she staggered and fell back, but next moment he was threatening the other child, who was standing, still laughing, in the doorway. She screamed, and ran towards the kitchen. Lebedeff stamped his foot angrily; then, seeing the prince regarding him with amazement, he murmured apologetically--"Pardon to show respect! . . . he-he!"</p> 
<p>" You are quite wrong . . ." began the prince.</p> 
<p>"At once . . . at once . . . in one moment!"</p> 
<p>He rushed like a whirlwind from the room, and Muishkin looked inquiringly at the others.</p> 
<p>They were all laughing, and the guest joined in the chorus.</p> 
<p>"He has gone to get his coat," said the boy.</p> 
<p>"How annoying!" exclaimed the prince. "I thought . . . Tell me, is he . . ."</p> 
<p>"You think he is drunk?" cried the young man on the sofa. " Not in the least. He's only had three or four small glasses, perhaps five; but what is that? The usual thing!"</p> 
<p>As the prince opened his mouth to answer, he was interrupted by the girl, whose sweet face wore an expression of absolute frankness.</p> 
<p>"He never drinks much in the morning; if you have come to talk business with him, do it now. It is the best time. He sometimes comes back drunk in the evening; but just now he passes the greater part of the evening in tears, and reads passages of Holy Scripture aloud, because our mother died five weeks ago."</p> 
<p>"No doubt he ran off because he did not know what to say to you," said the youth on the divan. "I bet he is trying to cheat you, and is thinking how best to do it."</p> 
<p>Just then Lebedeff returned, having put on his coat.</p> 
<p>"Five weeks!" said he, wiping his eyes. "Only five weeks! Poor orphans!"</p> 
<p>"But why wear a coat in holes," asked the girl, "when your new one is hanging behind the door? Did you not see it?"</p> 
<p>"Hold your tongue, dragon-fly!" he scolded. "What a plague you are!" He stamped his foot irritably, but she only laughed, and answered:</p> 
<p>"Are you trying to frighten me? I am not Tania, you know, and I don't intend to run away. Look, you are waking Lubotchka, and she will have convulsions again. Why do you shout like that?"</p> 
<p>"Well, well! I won't again," said the master of the house his anxiety getting the better of his temper. He went up to his daughter, and looked at the child in her arms, anxiously making the sign of the cross over her three times. "God bless her! God bless her!" he cried with emotion. "This little creature is my daughter Luboff," addressing the prince. "My wife, Helena, died-- at her birth; and this is my big daughter Vera, in mourning, as you see; and this, this, oh, this pointing to the young man on the divan . . .</p> 
<p>"Well, go on! never mind me!" mocked the other. "Don't be afraid!"</p> 
<p>"Excellency! Have you read that account of the murder of the Zemarin family, in the newspaper?" cried Lebedeff, all of a sudden.</p> 
<p>"Yes," said Muishkin, with some surprise.</p> 
<p>"Well, that is the murderer! It is he--in fact--"</p> 
<p>"What do you mean?" asked the visitor.</p> 
<p>"I am speaking allegorically, of course; but he will be the murderer of a Zemarin family in the future. He is getting ready . .. ."</p> 
<p>They all laughed, and the thought crossed the prince's mind that perhaps Lebedeff was really trifling in this way because he foresaw inconvenient questions, and wanted to gain time.</p> 
<p>"He is a traitor! a conspirator!" shouted Lebedeff, who seemed to have lost all control over himself. " A monster! a slanderer! Ought I to treat him as a nephew, the son of my sister Anisia?"</p> 
<p>"Oh! do be quiet! You must be drunk! He has taken it into his head to play the lawyer, prince, and he practices speechifying, and is always repeating his eloquent pleadings to his children. And who do you think was his last client? An old woman who had been robbed of five hundred roubles, her all, by some rogue of a usurer, besought him to take up her case, instead of which he defended the usurer himself, a Jew named Zeidler, because this Jew promised to give him fifty roubles. . . ."</p> 
<p>"It was to be fifty if I won the case, only five if I lost," interrupted Lebedeff, speaking in a low tone, a great contrast to his earlier manner.</p> 
<p>"Well! naturally he came to grief: the law is not administered as it used to be, and he only got laughed at for his pains. But he was much pleased with himself in spite of that. 'Most learned judge!' said he, 'picture this unhappy man, crippled by age and infirmities, who gains his living by honourable toil--picture him, I repeat, robbed of his all, of his last mouthful; remember, I entreat you, the words of that learned legislator, "Let mercy and justice alike rule the courts of law."' Now, would you believe it, excellency, every morning he recites this speech to us from beginning to end, exactly as he spoke it before the magistrate. To-day we have heard it for the fifth time. He was just starting again when you arrived, so much does he admire it. He is now preparing to undertake another case. I think, by the way, that you are Prince Muishkin? Colia tells me you are the cleverest man he has ever known. . . ."</p> 
<p>"The cleverest in the world," interrupted his uncle hastily.</p> 
<p>"I do not pay much attention to that opinion," continued the young man calmly. "Colia is very fond of you, but he," pointing to Lebedeff, "is flattering you. I can assure you I have no intention of flattering you, or anyone else, but at least you have some common-sense. Well, will you judge between us? Shall we ask the prince to act as arbitrator?" he went on, addressing his uncle.</p> 
<p>"I am so glad you chanced to come here, prince."</p> 
<p>"I agree," said Lebedeff, firmly, looking round involuntarily at his daughter, who had come nearer, and was listening attentively to the conversation.</p> 
<p>"What is it all about?" asked the prince, frowning. His head ached, and he felt sure that Lebedeff was trying to cheat him in some way, and only talking to put off the explanation that he had come for.</p> 
<p>"I will tell you all the story. I am his nephew; he did speak the truth there, although he is generally telling lies. I am at the University, and have not yet finished my course. I mean to do so, and I shall, for I have a determined character. I must, however, find something to do for the present, and therefore I have got employment on the railway at twenty-four roubles a month. I admit that my uncle has helped me once or twice before. Well, I had twenty roubles in my pocket, and I gambled them away. Can you believe that I should be so low, so base, as to lose money in that way?"</p> 
<p>"And the man who won it is a rogue, a rogue whom you ought not to have paid!" cried Lebedeff.</p> 
<p>"Yes, he is a rogue, but I was obliged to pay him," said the young man. "As to his being a rogue, he is assuredly that, and I am not saying it because he beat you. He is an ex-lieutenant, prince, dismissed from the service, a teacher of boxing, and one of Rogojin's followers. They are all lounging about the pavements now that Rogojin has turned them off. Of course, the worst of it is that, knowing he was a rascal, and a card-sharper, I none the less played palki with him, and risked my last rouble. To tell the truth, I thought to myself, 'If I lose, I will go to my uncle, and I am sure he will not refuse to help me.' Now that was base-cowardly and base!"</p> 
<p>"That is so," observed Lebedeff quietly; "cowardly and base."</p> 
<p>"Well, wait a bit, before you begin to triumph," said the nephew viciously; for the words seemed to irritate him. "He is delighted! I came to him here and told him everything: I acted honourably, for I did not excuse myself. I spoke most severely of my conduct, as everyone here can witness. But I must smarten myself up before I take up my new post, for I am really like a tramp. Just look at my boots! I cannot possibly appear like this, and if I am not at the bureau at the time appointed, the job will be given to someone else; and I shall have to try for another. Now I only beg for fifteen roubles, and I give my word that I will never ask him for anything again. I am also ready to promise to repay my debt in three months' time, and I will keep my word, even if I have to live on bread and water. My salary will amount to seventy-five roubles in three months. The sum I now ask, added to what I have borrowed already, will make a total of about thirty-five roubles, so you see I shall have enough to pay him and confound him! if he wants interest, he shall have that, too! Haven't I always paid back the money he lent me before? Why should he be so mean now? He grudges my having paid that lieutenant; there can be no other reason! That's the kind he is-- a dog in the manger!"</p> 
<p>"And he won't go away!" cried Lebedeff. "He has installed himself here, and here he remains!"</p> 
<p>"I have told you already, that I will not go away until I have got what I ask. Why are you smiling, prince? You look as if you disapproved of me."</p> 
<p>"I am not smiling, but I really think you are in the wrong, somewhat," replied Muishkin, reluctantly.</p> 
<p>"Don't shuffle! Say plainly that you think that I am quite wrong, without any 'somewhat'! Why 'somewhat'?"</p> 
<p>"I will say you are quite wrong, if you wish."</p> 
<p>"If I wish! That's good, I must say! Do you think I am deceived as to the flagrant impropriety of my conduct? I am quite aware that his money is his own, and that my action -As much like an attempt at extortion. But you-you don't know what life is! If people don't learn by experience, they never understand. They must be taught. My intentions are perfectly honest; on my conscience he will lose nothing, and I will pay back the money with interest. Added to which he has had the moral satisfaction of seeing me disgraced. What does he want more? and what is he good for if he never helps anyone? Look what he does himself! just ask him about his dealings with others, how he deceives people! How did he manage to buy this house? You may cut off my head if he has not let you in for something-and if he is not trying to cheat you again. You are smiling. You don't believe me?"</p> 
<p>"It seems to me that all this has nothing to do with your affairs," remarked the prince.</p> 
<p>"I have lain here now for three days," cried the young man without noticing, "and I have seen a lot! Fancy! he suspects his daughter, that angel, that orphan, my cousin--he suspects her, and every evening he searches her room, to see if she has a lover hidden in it! He comes here too on tiptoe, creeping softly--oh, so softly--and looks under the sofa--my bed, you know. He is mad with suspicion, and sees a thief in every corner. He runs about all night long; he was up at least seven times last night, to satisfy himself that the windows and doors were barred, and to peep into the oven. That man who appears in court for scoundrels, rushes in here in the night and prays, lying prostrate, banging his head on the ground by the half-hour--and for whom do you think he prays? Who are the sinners figuring in his drunken petitions? I have heard him with my own ears praying for the repose of the soul of the Countess du Barry! Colia heard it too. He is as mad as a March hare!"</p> 
<p>"You hear how he slanders me, prince," said Lebedeff, almost beside himself with rage. "I may be a drunkard, an evil-doer, a thief, but at least I can say one thing for myself. He does not know--how should he, mocker that he is?--that when he came into the world it was I who washed him, and dressed him in his swathing-bands, for my sister Anisia had lost her husband, and was in great poverty. I was very little better off than she, but I sat up night after night with her, and nursed both mother and child; I used to go downstairs and steal wood for them from the house-porter. How often did I sing him to sleep when I was half dead with hunger! In short, I was more than a father to him, and now--now he jeers at me! Even if I did cross myself, and pray for the repose of the soul of the Comtesse du Barry, what does it matter? Three days ago, for the first time in my life, I read her biography in an historical dictionary. Do you know who she was? You there!" addressing his nephew. "Speak! do you know?"</p> 
<p>"Of course no one knows anything about her but you," muttered the young man in a would-be jeering tone.</p> 
<p>"She was a Countess who rose from shame to reign like a Queen. An Empress wrote to her, with her own hand, as 'Ma chere cousine.' At a lever-du-roi one morning (do you know what a lever-du-roi was?)--a Cardinal, a Papal legate, offered to put on her stockings; a high and holy person like that looked on it as an honour! Did you know this? I see by your expression that you did not! Well, how did she die? Answer!"</p> 
<p>"Oh! do stop--you are too absurd!"</p> 
<p>"This is how she died. After all this honour and glory, after having been almost a Queen, she was guillotined by that butcher, Samson. She was quite innocent, but it had to be done, for the satisfaction of the fishwives of Paris. She was so terrified, that she did not understand what was happening. But when Samson seized her head, and pushed her under the knife with his foot, she cried out: 'Wait a moment! wait a moment, monsieur!' Well, because of that moment of bitter suffering, perhaps the Saviour will pardon her other faults, for one cannot imagine a greater agony. As I read the story my heart bled for her. And what does it matter to you, little worm, if I implored the Divine mercy for her, great sinner as she was, as I said my evening prayer? I might have done it because I doubted if anyone had ever crossed himself for her sake before. It may be that in the other world she will rejoice to think that a sinner like herself has cried to heaven for the salvation of her soul. Why are you laughing? You believe nothing, atheist! And your story was not even correct! If you had listened to what I was saying, you would have heard that I did not only pray for the Comtesse du Barry. I said, 'Oh Lord! give rest to the soul of that great sinner, the Comtesse du Barry, and to all unhappy ones like her.' You see that is quite a different thing, for how many sinners there are, how many women, who have passed through the trials of this life, are now suffering and groaning in purgatory! I prayed for you, too, in spite of your insolence and impudence, also for your fellows, as it seems that you claim to know how I pray. . ."</p> 
<p>"Oh! that's enough in all conscience! Pray for whom you choose, and the devil take them and you! We have a scholar here; you did not know that, prince?" he continued, with a sneer. "He reads all sorts of books and memoirs now."</p> 
<p>"At any rate, your uncle has a kind heart," remarked the prince, who really had to force himself to speak to the nephew, so much did he dislike him.</p> 
<p>"Oh, now you are going to praise him! He will be set up! He puts his hand on his heart, and he is delighted! I never said he was a man without heart, but he is a rascal--that's the pity of it. And then, he is addicted to drink, and his mind is unhinged, like that of most people who have taken more than is good for them for years. He loves his children--oh, I know that well enough! He respected my aunt, his late wife ... and he even has a sort of affection for me. He has remembered me in his will."</p> 
<p>"I shall leave you nothing!" exclaimed his uncle angrily.</p> 
<p>"Listen to me, Lebedeff," said the prince in a decided voice, turning his back on the young man. "I know by experience that when you choose, you can be business-like. . I . I have very little time to spare, and if you ... By the way--excuse me--what is your Christian name? I have forgotten it."</p> 
<p>"Ti-Ti-Timofey."</p> 
<p>"And?"</p> 
<p>"Lukianovitch."</p>  
<p>"Is that true?" said the prince impatiently.</p> 
<p>"My name really is Lukian Timofeyovitch," acknowledged Lebedeff, lowering his eyes, and putting his hand on his heart.</p> 
<p>"Well, for God's sake, what made you say the other?"</p> 
<p>"To humble myself," murmured Lebedeff.</p> 
<p>"What on earth do you mean? Oh I if only I knew where Colia was at this moment!" cried the prince, standing up, as if to go.</p> 
<p>"I can tell you all about Colia," said the young man</p> 
<p>"Oh! no, no!" said Lebedeff, hurriedly.</p> 
<p>"Colia spent the night here, and this morning went after his father, whom you let out of prison by paying his debts--Heaven only knows why! Yesterday the general promised to come and lodge here, but he did not appear. Most probably he slept at the hotel close by. No doubt Colia is there, unless he has gone to Pavlofsk to see the Epanchins. He had a little money, and was intending to go there yesterday. He must be either at the hotel or at Pavlofsk."</p> 
<p>"At Pavlofsk! He is at Pavlofsk, undoubtedly!" interrupted Lebedeff. . . . "But come--let us go into the garden--we will have coffee there. . . ." And Lebedeff seized the prince's arm, and led him from the room. They went across the yard, and found themselves in a delightful little garden with the trees already in their summer dress of green, thanks to the unusually fine weather. Lebedeff invited his guest to sit down on a green seat before a table of the same colour fixed in the earth, and took a seat facing him. In a few minutes the coffee appeared, and the prince did not refuse it. The host kept his eyes fixed on Muishkin, with an expression of passionate servility.</p> 
<p>"I knew nothing about your home before," said the prince absently, as if he were thinking of something else.</p> 
<p>"Poor orphans," began Lebedeff, his face assuming a mournful air, but he stopped short, for the other looked at him inattentively, as if he had already forgotten his own remark. They waited a few minutes in silence, while Lebedeff sat with his eyes fixed mournfully on the young man's face.</p> 
<p>"Well!" said the latter, at last rousing himself. "Ah! yes! You know why I came, Lebedeff. Your letter brought me. Speak! Tell me all about it."</p> 
<p>The clerk, rather confused, tried to say something, hesitated, began to speak, and again stopped. The prince looked at him gravely.</p> 
<p>"I think I understand, Lukian Timofeyovitch: you were not sure that I should come. You did not think I should start at the first word from you, and you merely wrote to relieve your conscience. However, you see now that I have come, and I have had enough of trickery. Give up serving, or trying to serve, two masters. Rogojin has been here these three weeks. Have you managed to sell her to him as you did before? Tell me the truth."</p> 
<p>"He discovered everything, the monster ... himself ......"</p> 
<p>"Don't abuse him; though I dare say you have something to complain of. . . ."</p> 
<p>"He beat me, he thrashed me unmercifully!" replied Lebedeff vehemently. "He set a dog on me in Moscow, a bloodhound, a terrible beast that chased me all down the street."</p> 
<p>"You seem to take me for a child, Lebedeff. Tell me, is it a fact that she left him while they were in Moscow?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, it is a fact, and this time, let me tell you, on the very eve of their marriage! It was a question of minutes when she slipped off to Petersburg. She came to me directly she arrived-- 'Save me, Lukian! find me some refuge, and say nothing to the prince!' She is afraid of you, even more than she is of him, and in that she shows her wisdom!" And Lebedeff slily put his finger to his brow as he said the last words.</p> 
<p>"And now it is you who have brought them together again?"</p> 
<p>"Excellency, how could I, how could I prevent it?"</p> 
<p>"That will do. I can find out for myself. Only tell me, where is she now? At his house? With him?"</p> 
<p>"Oh no! Certainly not! 'I am free,' she says; you know how she insists on that point. 'I am entirely free.' She repeats it over and over again. She is living in Petersburgskaia, with my sister- in-law, as I told you in my letter."</p> 
<p>"She is there at this moment?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, unless she has gone to Pavlofsk: the fine weather may have tempted her, perhaps, into the country, with Daria Alexeyevna. 'I am quite free,' she says. Only yesterday she boasted of her freedom to Nicolai Ardalionovitch--a bad sign," added Lebedeff, smiling.</p> 
<p>"Colia goes to see her often, does he not?"</p> 
<p>"He is a strange boy, thoughtless, and inclined to be indiscreet."</p> 
<p>"Is it long since you saw her?"</p> 
<p>"I go to see her every day, every day."</p> 
<p>"Then you were there yesterday?"</p> 
<p>"N-no: I have not been these three last days."</p> 
<p>"It is a pity you have taken too much wine, Lebedeff I want to ask you something ... but. . ."</p> 
<p>"All right! all right! I am not drunk," replied the clerk, preparing to listen.</p> 
<p>"Tell me, how was she when you left her?"</p> 
<p>"She is a woman who is seeking. .. "</p> 
<p>"Seeking?"</p> 
<p>"She seems always to be searching about, as if she had lost something. The mere idea of her coming marriage disgusts her; she looks on it as an insult. She cares as much for HIM as for a piece of orange-peel--not more. Yet I am much mistaken if she does not look on him with fear and trembling. She forbids his name to be mentioned before her, and they only meet when unavoidable. He understands, well enough! But it must be gone through She is restless, mocking, deceitful, violent...."</p> 
<p>"Deceitful and violent?"</p> 
<p>"Yes, violent. I can give you a proof of it. A few days ago she tried to pull my hair because I said something that annoyed her. I tried to soothe her by reading the Apocalypse aloud."</p> 
<p>"What?" exclaimed the prince, thinking he had not heard aright.</p> 
<p>"By reading the Apocalypse. The lady has a restless imagination, he-he! She has a liking for conversation on serious subjects, of any kind; in fact they please her so much, that it flatters her to discuss them. Now for fifteen years at least I have studied the Apocalypse, and she agrees with me in thinking that the present is the epoch represented by the third horse, the black one whose rider holds a measure in his hand. It seems to me that everything is ruled by measure in our century; all men are clamouring for their rights; 'a measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny.' But, added to this, men desire freedom of mind and body, a pure heart, a healthy life, and all God's good gifts. Now by pleading their rights alone, they will never attain all this, so the white horse, with his rider Death, comes next, and is followed by Hell. We talked about this matter when we met, and it impressed her very much."</p> 
<p>"Do you believe all this?" asked Muishkin, looking curiously at his companion.</p> 
<p>"I both believe it and explain it. I am but a poor creature, a beggar, an atom in the scale of humanity. Who has the least respect for Lebedeff? He is a target for all the world, the butt of any fool who chooses to kick him. But in interpreting revelation I am the equal of anyone, great as he may be! Such is the power of the mind and the spirit. I have made a lordly personage tremble, as he sat in his armchair . . . only by talking to him of things concerning the spirit. Two years ago, on Easter Eve, His Excellency Nil Alexeyovitch, whose subordinate I was then, wished to hear what I had to say, and sent a message by Peter Zakkaritch to ask me to go to his private room. 'They tell me you expound the prophecies relating to Antichrist,' said he, when we were alone. 'Is that so?' ' Yes,' I answered unhesitatingly, and I began to give some comments on the Apostle's allegorical vision. At first he smiled, but when we reached the numerical computations and correspondences, he trembled, and turned pale. Then he begged me to close the book, and sent me away, promising to put my name on the reward list. That took place as I said on the eve of Easter, and eight days later his soul returned to God."</p> 
<p>"What?"</p> 
<p>"It is the truth. One evening after dinner he stumbled as he stepped out of his carriage. He fell, and struck his head on the curb, and died immediately. He was seventy-three years of age, and had a red face, and white hair; he deluged himself with scent, and was always smiling like a child. Peter Zakkaritch recalled my interview with him, and said, 'YOU FORETOLD HIS DEATH.'"</p> 
<p>The prince rose from his seat, and Lebedeff, surprised to see his guest preparing to go so soon, remarked: "You are not interested?" in a respectful tone.</p> 
<p>"I am not very well, and my head aches. Doubtless the effect of the journey," replied the prince, frowning.</p> 
<p>"You should go into the country," said Lebedeff timidly.</p> 
<p>The prince seemed to be considering the suggestion.</p> 
<p>"You see, I am going into the country myself in three days, with my children and belongings. The little one is delicate; she needs change of air; and during our absence this house will be done up. I am going to Pavlofsk."</p> 
<p>"You are going to Pavlofsk too?" asked the prince sharply. "Everybody seems to be going there. Have you a house in that neighbourhood?"</p> 
<p>"I don't know of many people going to Pavlofsk, and as for the house, Ivan Ptitsin has let me one of his villas rather cheaply. It is a pleasant place, lying on a hill surrounded by trees, and one can live there for a mere song. There is good music to be heard, so no wonder it is popular. I shall stay in the lodge. As to the villa itself. . "</p> 
<p>"Have you let it?"</p> 
<p>"N-no--not exactly."</p> 
<p>"Let it to me," said the prince.</p> 
<p>Now this was precisely what Lebedeff had made up his mind to do in the last three minutes. Not that he bad any difficulty in finding a tenant; in fact the house was occupied at present by a chance visitor, who had told Lebedeff that he would perhaps take it for the summer months. The clerk knew very well that this "PERHAPS" meant "CERTAINLY," but as he thought he could make more out of a tenant like the prince, he felt justified in speaking vaguely about the present inhabitant's intentions. "This is quite a coincidence," thought he, and when the subject of price was mentioned, he made a gesture with his hand, as if to waive away a question of so little importance.</p> 
<p>"Oh well, as you like!" said Muishkin. "I will think it over. You shall lose nothing!"</p> 
<p>They were walking slowly across the garden.</p> 
<p>"But if you ... I could . . ." stammered Lebedeff, "if...if you please, prince, tell you something on the subject which would interest you, I am sure." He spoke in wheedling tones, and wriggled as he walked along.</p> 
<p>Muishkin stopped short.</p> 
<p>"Daria Alexeyevna also has a villa at Pavlofsk."</p> 
<p>"Well?"</p> 
<p>"A certain person is very friendly with her, and intends to visit her pretty often."</p> 
<p>Well?"</p> 
<p>"Aglaya Ivanovna..."</p> 
<p>"Oh stop, Lebedeff!" interposed Muishkin, feeling as if he had been touched on an open wound. "That ... that has nothing to do with me. I should like to know when you are going to start. The sooner the better as far as I am concerned, for I am at an hotel."</p> 
<p>They had left the garden now, and were crossing the yard on their way to the gate.</p> 
<p>"Well, leave your hotel at once and come here; then we can all go together to Pavlofsk the day after tomorrow."</p> 
<p>"I will think about it," said the prince dreamily, and went off.</p> 
<p>The clerk stood looking after his guest, struck by his sudden absent-mindedness. He had not even remembered to say goodbye, and Lebedeff was the more surprised at the omission, as he knew by experience how courteous the prince usually was.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>６月最初几天，彼得堡难得己有整整一星期好天气了。叶潘钦家在帕夫洛夫斯克有一处富丽的私人别墅。叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜忽然心血来潮，说走就走，忙了不到两天，就动身前往了。</p> 
<p>叶潘钦家走后第二或第三天，列夫·尼古拉耶维奇·梅什金公爵坐早车从莫斯科抵达彼得堡。车站上没有人迎接他，但在走出车厢的时候忽然觉得就在围住这趟车来客的人群中，有什么人的两只眼睛射出奇怪而炽烈的目光。他又注意看看，却再也没有辨认出什么。当然，仅仅是幻觉而已，但是留下的印象却是不愉快的。况且公爵本来就已很抑郁，若有所思，似乎为什么事而忧心忡忡。</p> 
<p>马车把他载到一家离利捷伊纳亚街不过的旅馆。这家旅馆条件很差，公爵要了两个小房间，光线幽暗，陈设也差，他盥洗更衣完毕，什么话也没问便匆匆外出，仿佛怕过了时间或者怕遇不上人家在家里。</p> 
<p>如果半年前在他第一次来彼得堡时认识他的人中有谁现在朝他看上一眼的话，那么，大概会得出结论说，他的外表变得比过去好得多；但是实际上未必如此。只有衣服全都换过了：全部服装都是在莫斯科由好裁缝制作的，但是衣服还是有缺点：缝制得太时髦了（做工很到家、但是不大有才干的裁缝往往如此），此外穿在彼此丝毫不感兴趣的人身上，那么，一个十分爱嘲笑的人只要仔细地看一眼公爵，大概就会发现有什么值得一笑了。但是世上可笑的事情难道还少吗？</p> 
<p>公爵雇了马车出彼斯基。在罗日杰斯特文斯基街区的一条街上他很快找到了一座不大的小木屋，使他颇为惊讶的是，这座小木屋看起来还挺漂亮，干干净净，井井有条，还有一个种着花的庭前花圃。朝街的窗户敞开着，里面传出接连不断的激烈的话声，甚至是叫喊声，好像谁在这里高声朗读，甚至在作演讲；这声音有时被几个清脆的噪音发出的笑声所打断。公爵走进院子，登上台阶，求见列别杰夫先生。</p> 
<p>“这就是他们，”袖子捋到肘部的厨娘开了门，用指头朝“客厅”戳了一下，回答说。</p> 
<p>在这间糊着深蓝色壁纸的客厅里收拾得很是洁净，还颇有些讲究：一张园桌和沙发，带玻璃罩的一座青铜台钟，窗间壁上挂着一面狭长的镜子，天花板上用铜链悬挂着一盏有许多玻璃坠子的枝形吊灯。房间中央站着列别杰夫本人，他背朝进来的公爵，穿着背心，没穿上装，像是厥的衣着。他正拍打着自己的胸脯，正就某个题目痛心疾首地演说着。听众是一个１５岁的男孩，有着一张快活和聪颖的脸蛋，手中拿着一本书；２０岁左右的一个年轻姑娘，全身丧服，手上还抱着一个婴信；一个１３岁的女孩也穿着丧服，她笑得很厉害，而且还把嘴巴张得大大的；最后是一个异常奇怪的听众，小伙子２０岁左右，躺在沙发上，长得相当漂亮，微黑的皮肤，浓密的长发，黑黑的大眼睛，鬓角和下巴上露出些许胡子，似乎就是这个听客经常打断滔滔不绝的列别杰夫，并与他争论，其余的听众大概正是笑的这一点。</p> 
<p>“鲁基扬·季莫菲伊奇，暖，鲁基扬·季莫菲伊奇！瞧瞧嘛！往这边瞧！嘿，你们可真该死！”</p> 
<p>厨娘挥了一下双手，气得满脸通红，走开了。</p> 
<p>列别杰夫回头一看，看见了公爵，仿佛被雷打似的怔怔地站了片刻，接着就堆起馅媚的微笑朝他奔去，但在途中又仿佛愣住了，不过还是叫出了：</p> 
<p>“公爵阁--下！”</p> 
<p>但是，突然他似乎仍未能做到自在洒脱，转过身去，无缘无故地先是斥责手上抱着婴儿的穿丧服的姑娘，以致她因为出其不意而急忙闪开，但列另杰夫立即就撇开她，冲着站在进另一个房间门口的１３岁女孩喊骂，而她刚才的笑兴未尽，脸上还带着微笑，现在则受不了喊骂，急忙逃到厨房去了，列别杰夫甚至还朝她背后跺了几脚，为的是进一步吓唬吓唬她，但是，当他遇到公爵局促不安的目光后，便解释说：</p> 
<p>“这是为了……恭敬，嘻……嘻！”</p> 
<p>“您用不着这样的……”公爵刚开始说。</p> 
<p>“马上，马上，马上……就像一阵风！”</p> 
<p>列别杰夫很快就从房间里消失了。公爵惊讶地看了一眼姑娘，男孩和躺在沙发上的小伙子。他们全都在笑，于是公爵也笑了起来。</p> 
<p>“他去穿燕尾服了，”男孩说。</p> 
<p>“这一切可真遗憾，”公爵开始说，“我本来以为……请告诉我，他……”</p> 
<p>“您以为他醉了？”沙发上喊出了声音，“一点也没醉！不过喝了三四杯，嘿，就算五杯吧，这算得了什么，老规矩！”</p> 
<p>公爵本要朝向沙发上的小伙子，但是姑娘说起话来，她那可爱的脸上现出最坦诚的神情。</p> 
<p>“他早晨从不多喝酒，如果您找他有什么事，那么就请现在谈，正是时候。只是傍晚回来时，他就喝得醉醺醺的；而且现在临睡前常常要哭，给我们念《圣经》，因为我们的妈妈五星期前去世了。”</p> 
<p>“他跑开是因为他确实难以应付您，”沙发上的年轻人笑了起来说，“我敢打赌，他马上就要哄骗您，正是这会儿在动脑筋呢。”</p> 
<p>“才五个星期！才五个星期！”列别杰夫已经穿了燕尾服回来，接过话茬说，他一边眨着眼睛，一边从口袋里掏出手绢擦眼泪。“剩下了一堆孤儿。”</p> 
<p>“您于吗穿着补窟窿的衣服出来？”姑娘说，“这儿门背后不是放着一件崭新的外套吗，您没看见？”</p> 
<p>“闭嘴！多事的丫头！”列别杰夫朝她喊道，“哼，你呀！”他本想对她跺脚，可这一次她只是放声大笑。</p> 
<p>“您干吗要吓唬，我可不是塔尼娅，我不会逃开。而柳芭奇卡看来要被您吵醒了，还会得个急惊风……您嚷嚷什么呀！”</p> 
<p>“不许说，不许说！叫你烂舌头，烂舌头……”列别杰夫忽然吓坏了，奔向姑娘手上抱着的睡着的孩子，带着惊恐的神情几次给他划十字。“上帝保佑，上帝大大保佑！这是我的襁褓婴儿，女儿柳波芙，”他对公爵说，“是合法婚姻所生，我那刚死去的妻子叫叶列娜，是分娩时死的。而这个丑丫头，穿丧服的，是我的女儿维拉……而这个，这个，哦，这一个是……”</p> 
<p>“怎么停住了？”年轻人喊了起来，“你接着说呀，别不好意思。”</p> 
<p>“阁下！”突然列别杰夫冲动地嚷了起来，“您注意到报上关于热马林一家被害的消息没有？”</p> 
<p>“我看过，”公爵有几分惊讶地说。</p> 
<p>“喏，这就是杀害热马林一家的真正凶手，就是他！”</p> 
<p>“你这是说什么呀？”公爵说。</p> 
<p>“也就是一种隐喻说法，未来第二个热马林家的未来第二个凶手，如果会有这样的事的话。他正准备走这样的路……”</p> 
<p>大家都笑了起来。公爵想起了，列别杰夫大概真的在踌躇斟酌和装腔作势，就因为他预感到公爵要向他提问题，而他不知道怎么回答、因此就设法同得时间来考虑。</p> 
<p>“他要造反！他在策划阴谋。”列别杰夫似乎已经不能克制自己，高声嚷着。“哼，这么一个造谣中伤的人，可以说是个浪子和恶棍，难道我能，嘿，难道我有权可以把他看作是自己的亲外甥，看作是已故姐姐阿尼西娅的独生子吗？”</p> 
<p>“住口吧，你这个喝醉的人！您相信吗，公爵，现在他想出来当律师，去担任法律诉讼的代理人；于是就开始练起口才来，在家里老是跟孩子们高谈阔论。五天前他在民事法官们面前做过一次讲话。可是他为谁辩护？不是为老太婆，她曾经央告他，请求他，有一个放高利贷的无赖向她勒索了５００卢布，这是她的全部财产，可那无赖把它占为己有。他却为这个放高利贷的犹太人扎伊德列尔辩护，就因为这家伙答应给他５０卢布……”</p> 
<p>“如果我赢了才给５０，如果输了只给５个卢布，”列别杰夫忽然用跟刚才完全不同的声调解释说，仿佛他从来也没有叫喊过。</p> 
<p>“嘿，他就胡扯一通，当然，现在可不是老套的制度，在那里他只受到人家的嘲笑。但他却满意得很；他说，铁面无私的法官先生们，请你们想想，一个境遇凄凉的老头，经常卧床不起，靠诚实的劳动为生，正要失去最后一块面包。谓你们想想立法者申千句明哲话：‘让仁慈主宰法庭。’你相信不，每天早晨在这里他就向我们反来复去讲这儿句话，就像在那边说的一模一样；今天是第五次了，就在您光临之前还在说，他是那样喜欢这段话，孤芳自赏得不得了，还打算为什么人辩护呢。您好像是梅什金公爵吧？科利亚向我谈起过您，说至今世上还没有遇到过比您更聪明的人……”</p> 
<p>＊１８６８年３月商人热马林一一家六口被１８岁的中学生维托尔德·戈尔斯基所杀，作者认为凶手是受“虚无主义”思想的影响。</p> 
<p>“是的，是的！世上没有更聪明的了！”列别杰夫随即附和说。</p> 
<p>“嘿，这一个是撒谎。科利亚是爱您，而他是巴结您。我则根本不打算奉承您，您会知道这点的。您可不是没有理智的人：您倒评判评判我和他；喂，想不想让公爵给我们评怦理？”他转向舅舅问。“我甚至很高兴，公爵，您来得正好。”</p> 
<p>“想！”列别杰夫毅然喊了一声，又不由自主地回头看了一下重又开始慢慢挪近前来的听众。</p> 
<p>“你们在这里干什么？”公爵皱了下眉说。</p> 
<p>他真的在头痛，而且他越来越确信，列别杰夫是在蒙骗他并为能延缓谈正事而乐滋滋的。</p> 
<p>“我来说一下事情。虽然他满口谎言，我是他的外甥这一点，他没有撒谎。我没有结束学业，但是想念完它并且将坚持实现自己的意愿，因为我有性格。为了实现这一愿望，暂时我找到了铁路上月薪２５卢布的一个位置。此外，我承认，他已经帮助过我两三回。我曾经有２０卢布，但却给赌输了。哎，您相信吗，公爵，我有多无赖，多卑贱，竟把这些钱赌输了。”</p> 
<p>“输给了恶棍，恶棍！就不应该把钱付给他！”列别杰夫喊道。</p> 
<p>“是的，是输给了一个恶棍，但是应该付钱给他，”年轻人继续说，“关于说他是个恶棍，我也能证明，这不只是因为他狠狠地揍了我一顿。公爵，他是个被淘汰的军官，过去罗戈任一伙里的退役中尉，现在在教拳击。罗戈任把他们赶走后，他们现在都四处漂泊。但最糟糕的是，我明明知道他，知道他是恶棍，无赖和小偷，我却仍然坐下来跟他一起赌。赌到最后一个卢布（我们玩的是帕尔基牌）时，我暗自想：要是输了，就去找鲁基扬舅舅，向他鞠个躬，他是不会拒绝的。这很卑鄙，确很卑鄙！，这已经是自觉的卑劣行径了！”</p> 
<p>“这不就是自觉的卑鄙行径嘛！”列别杰夫重复说。</p> 
<p>“算了，别得意，再等一下，”外甥气乎乎地喊着，“他还高兴顺。我到他这里，公爵，向他承认了一切；我做的是高姿态，我没有宽恕自己，在他面前尽我所能咒骂自己，这里大家都是见证人。为了占据铁路上这个位置，我怎么也一定得置办些衣服，因为我浑身上下都穿的破砂烂烂。瞧！这双靴子！不然的话我无法去上班，要是不在指定的期限去报到，别人就会占了位置，那时我又一场空，不知什么时候再找到另一个工作。现在我向他求借就１５个卢布，保证今后再也不借，而且，在头三个月里把所有的债务分文不少付清给他。我说话算数。我会靠面包和克瓦斯熬它几个月，因为我有性格。三个月我将得到７５个卢布。连同过去的钱，我一共应该还给他３５个卢布，也就是说，我会有钱偿付的。嘿，让他随便要多少利息也行，真见鬼！他不认识我，还是怎么的？您问问他，公爵，过去他帮助我的时候，我是不是还清了？为什么现在他不愿意了？就因为我把钱付给了那个中尉，他就发脾气了。没有别的原因！瞧这是个什么人，既不为自己着想，又不肯给别人方便！”</p> 
<p>“他还赖着不走！”列别杰夫嚷道，“躺在这里，赖着不走！”</p> 
<p>“我就是这么对你说的。你不给，我就不走。您笑什么，公爵？好像您认为我不对？”</p> 
<p>“我没有笑，但是，照我看，您确实有点不大对，”公爵勉强回答。</p> 
<p>“那您就直截了当说我完全不对，别转弯抹角说‘有点’！”</p> 
<p>“如果您愿意听，那么就是完全不对。”</p> 
<p>“如果我愿意！真可笑！难道·您以为、我自己不知道，这样做不大正当，钱是他的，该由他作主，从我这方面来说是强人所难。但是，公爵……您不了解生活。不教训教训他们，就不会明白事理。应该教训他们。我的良心是清白的。凭良心说，我不会使他吃亏的，我会连本加利归还的。精神上他也得到了满足：他看见了我这种低三下四的屈辱相。他还要什么？不给自己带来好处，他还能干什么？得了吧，他自己在干什么？您倒问问他，他怎么捉弄人家，怎么欺骗人家？他靠什么赚来了这所房子？如果他已经不蒙骗您，已经不再动脑溺怎么进一步欺骗您，我就把头砍下来！您在笑，不相信吗？”</p> 
<p>“我觉得，这跟您的事反正没多大关系，”公爵指出。</p> 
<p>“我躺在这里已经第三天了，我看够了！”年轻人不睬公爵的话，高声说道，“您倒想想，他竟对这么一个天使，就是这个姑娘，现在是孤儿，我的表妹，他自己的女儿也疑神疑鬼，每天夜里在她房里搜索情郎！他也蹑手蹑脚到我这儿来，在我睡的沙发底下寻找。疑心得简直发了疯，每个角落都见到有小偷。整夜一刻不停地从床上跳起来，一会看看窗户，是不是都关好了；一会儿试试门，还朝炉于探头探脑看一番，这样子一夜里要有七次，在法庭上他为骗子辩护，而夜里他自己起来做三次祷告，就在这厅里，跪曹，每次叩头要叩半小时，喝醉的时候，为谁不作析祷，为什么享不哭诉？他为杜巴里伯爵夫人”的灵魂得到安息祈祷过，我亲耳听到的，科利亚也听到过。他完全疯了。”</p> 
<p>“公爵，你看见了，也听见了，他是怎么侮辱我的？”列别杰夫脸红了，他真的怒不可遏，大声嚷了起来，“可是他不知道，我这个酒鬼，淫棍，强盗和歹徒，也许就凭一点就是有价值的人：就是这个挖苦嘲笑的人，当初还是婴儿的时候，我经常替他包溺褓，给他在澡盆里洗澡，在贫寒寡居的阿尼西娅姐姐那里，同样贫穷的我夜里就坐着，通宵不睡，照看着他们两个病人，我偷下面看门人的木柴，给这个小子唱歌，同手指打枢子哄他，我自己饿着肚子把他抚养大。可现在他却嘲笑我！再说，即使我真的有一天什么时候在额头上划十字祈求杜巴里伯爵夫人灵魂得到安息，又关你什么事？公爵，三天前我平生第一次在词典里读到了她的生午。你知道吗，杜巴里夫人是个什么人？你说呀，知道不知道？”</p> 
<p>“嘿，就你一个人知道不成？”年轻人讥讽而又勉强地嘟哝着。</p> 
<p>“这是这么一位伯爵夫人，她摆脱耻辱的地位，取代王后掌管大事，一位伟大的女皇在写给她的亲笔信中称她是ｍａ ｃｕｏｓｉｎｅ。＊红衣主教、罗马教皇使节在列维一久一鲁阿＊＊＊时（你知道什么是列维一久一鲁阿吗？）自告奋勇给她的光腿穿长丝袜，还将此看作是荣幸，尚且是这么一位崇高和神圣的人物！你知道这回事？从脸上我就看得出你不知道！那么她是怎么死的呢？既然你知道，就回答吗！”</p> 
<p>“滚开！老缠着人。”</p>

<p>“好了，够了，够了，你想为谁就为谁祷告吧，见你的鬼，还大声嚷嚷呢！”外甥烦恼地打断了他，“公爵，您不知道吧，他可是我们这儿博学多识的人，”外甥带着一种尴尬的冷笑补充说，“现在他老是读这一类的各种书籍和回忆录。”</p> 
<p>“您舅舅毕竟……不是冷酷无情的人，”公爵不太愿意地说。这个年轻人使他感到相当反感。</p> 
<p>“看来您要把他捧上天了！您看见了，他已经把手按在心口上了，嘴巴张成Ｖ形，马上他还想听好话呢！也许，他不是冷酷无情的人，但是个骗子，糟就糟在这里；’加上还酗酒，全身摇摇晃晃，支持不住，就如任何喝了多年酒的人一样，所以他老是吱哩哇拉乱响。就算他是爱孩子的，也尊重死去的舅妈……甚至也爱我，他可是在遗嘱里给我也留了一份，真的……”</p> 
<p>“我什么也不会留！”列别杰夫冷漠无情地嚷道。</p> 
<p>“听着，列别杰夫，”公爵转身不理睬年轻人，坚定地说，“我可是凭经验知道，当您愿意的时候，您就是一个实干的人……我现在时间很少，如果您……对不起，怎么称您的名字和父称？我忘了。”</p>

<p>所有在屋子里的人又大笑起来。</p> 
<p>“他撒谎！”外甥喊了起来，“连这也撒谎！公爵，他，根本不叫季莫菲·鲁基扬诺维奇，而叫鲁基扬·季莫菲耶维奇！嘿，说吧，你为什么要撒谎？算了吧，对你来说，叫鲁墓扬还是季莫菲还是一个样，公爵哪儿管得了这个？公爵，我请您相信，他说谎只是积习难改！”</p> 
<p>“难道这是真的？”公爵迫不及待地问。</p> 
<p>“鲁基扬·季莫菲耶维奇，这是真名，”列别杰夫承认并感到不好意思。他顺从地垂下双眼，又一次把手放到心口上。</p> 
<p>“您为什么要这样，啊，我的上帝！”</p> 
<p>“这是出于自谦，”列别杰夫喃喃着说，越来越恭顺地低下自己的头。</p> 
<p>“哎，这里要什么自谦！我只想知道，现在在哪里可以找到科利亚！”公爵说着，转过身准备离去。</p> 
<p>“我会告诉您，科利亚在什么地方，”年轻人又自告奋勇说。</p> 
<p>“不许说，不，绝不要讲！”列别杰夫气冲冲地急忙说，显得很是慌乱。</p> 
<p>“科利亚在这里过过夜，但第二天早晨便去寻找自己的将军父亲，公爵，天知道为什么您把他从‘债务监狱’里赎出来。昨天将军还答应光临这儿过夜，可是没有来。最可能是在《天平旅馆》过的夜，离这儿很近。因而，科利亚是在那里或者是在帕夫洛夫斯克叶潘钦家。他有钱，他昨天就想去的。就这么回事，在《天平旅馆》或者在帕夫洛夫斯克。”</p> 
<p>“在帕夫洛夫斯克，在帕夫焰夫斯克！……我们到这里，到花园里去……喝咖啡……”</p> 
<p>列别杰无拽住公爵的手。他们走出房间，穿过院子；走进篱笆门。这里面的有一个很小很小的花园，由于天气好所有的树木都已叶芽满枝了。列别杰夫让公爵坐到绿色的木条椅上，就在一张插入地中的绿色桌子旁边。自己则坐卒他对面。过了一会，咖啡也真的端上来了，公爵没有拒绝。列别杰夫陷媚和贪婪地继续望着他的眼睛。</p> 
<p>“我不知道，您有这样的家业，”公爵说，他那副样子想的却完全是另一回事。</p> 
<p>“全是孤－儿，”列别杰夫蟋缩一下身子，刚开始说就停住了，因为公爵心不在焉地望着自己面前，当然，他已忘记了自己的问题。又过了一会；列别杰夫察颜观色，期待着。</p> 
<p>“那又怎么啦？”公爵仿佛醒悟过来，说，“啊，对了！您自己也知道，列别杰夫，我们有什么事情：我是因为您的来信才来的，说吧。”列别杰夫十分困窘，想要说什么，但只是吱吱唔唔一下，什么也没有说出来。公爵等了一会，忧郁地笑了一下。</p> 
<p>“我好像非常理解您，鲁基扬·季莫菲耶维奇。大概，您并没期待我来。而认为，我不会因为您的第一个通知就从偏僻角落里赶来，您写信只是为了洗刷良心。而我却就赶来了。好了，够了，别欺骗了，一仆事二主的把戏该结束了。罗戈任在这里已经三个星期了，我全部知道。您已经像那次那样托她出卖给他了还是没有？说真话。”</p> 
<p>“是那个恶棍自己打听到的，是他自己。”</p> 
<p>“别骂他：当然，他对您是很坏……”</p> 
<p>“他狠狠地打了我，毒打了我！”列别杰夫激动万分接过话茬说，“在莫斯科他还放狗整条街地追我，是条跑得非常快的猎犬，一条凶猛异常的母狗。”</p> 
<p>“您把我当小孩了，列别杰夫。您说，她现在真的抛下他了，在莫斯科？”</p> 
<p>“真的，真的，又是在快要举行婚礼的时候。那家伙已经在一分钟一分钟地数时间了，可她却到了彼得堡这里；而且径直来找我、说：救救我，保护我，鲁基扬，也别告诉公爵……’公爵，她怕您比怕罗戈任更厉害，这一点实在深奥莫解！”</p> 
<p>列别杰夫还狡黯地把一个手指按到脑门上。</p> 
<p>“现在您又把他们弄到一起了？”</p> 
<p>“公爵阁下，我怎么能……怎么能不让呢？”</p> 
<p>“算了，够了，我自己会全弄清楚的。只不过告诉我，现在她在什么地方，在他那里吗？”</p> 
<p>“哦，不！绝对不在那里！她是独立的。她说，‘我是自由的。’公爵，您要知道，她强烈地坚持这一点，她说，‘我还完全是自由的！’她仍然在彼得堡岛＊上，住在我小姨子家里，我已经写信告诉过您了。”</p> 
<p>“现在还在那里？”</p> 
<p>＊圣波得堡的一个行政区。</p> 
<p>“除非因为好天气去帕夫洛夫斯克达里娅＊阿列克耐耶夫娜的别墅，就会在那里。她说、‘我是完全自由的。还在昨天她还对尼古拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇大谈特谈了一通自己的自由。这是不祥之兆啊！”</p> 
<p>列别杰夫咧嘴大笑。</p> 
<p>“科利亚常在她那里吗？”</p> 
<p>“他有点冒失和莫名其妙，还不大保守秘密。”</p> 
<p>“您很久没去那里了？”？”</p> 
<p>“每天都去，每天都去。”</p> 
<p>“这么说、昨天也去了？”</p> 
<p>“不，三天以前。”</p> 
<p>“真遗憾，您有点喝醉了、列别杰夫！不然我有事要同您。”</p> 
<p>“不，不，我一点也没醉！”</p> 
<p>列别杰夫两眼盯着他。</p> 
<p>“告诉我，您留下她时怎么样？”</p> 
<p>“心神不定，若有所失。”</p> 
<p>“若有所失？”</p> 
<p>“她似乎老在寻找什么，似乎丢了什么似的。对于即将举行的婚礼，甚至想起来就令她厌恶，而且将它看作是一种侮辱。对罗戈任本人看得像一块桔子皮，根本就不放在眼里，但是也放去眼里，既害怕又恐惧，甚至不许人家说到他“只有不得已的情况下他们才见面……罗戈任对此非常多愁善感！可是又无法避免！……而她心烦意乱。好嘲弄人，言行不一，好发脾气……”</p> 
<p>“言行不一和好发脾气？”</p> 
<p>“是好发脾气，因为上一回为了一次谈话差点没揪我的头发。我用《启示录》为她祈求平安。”</p> 
<p>“怎么回事？”公爵以为自己听错了，重问了一遍。</p> 
<p>“我给她念《启示录》。这是个有着令人不安的想象力的女士，嘻一嘻！而且我观察结果，她对一些严肃的话题，尽管与她毫不相干，却过分热衷。她喜欢，非常喜欢谈这些话题，甚至把这看作是人家对她的特别尊敬。是的，我在解释《启示录》方面是很在行的，而且已经讲了十五年了。她也同意我的说法，我们现在是在第三匹马即黑马的时代，是在于里拿着俄斗的骑士时代，因为如今一切都要用俄斗量，都要签合同，所有的人都只寻求自己的权利：‘一个银市换一俄斗小麦，一个银市换三俄斗大麦……，可在这同时人们还保留自由的精神和纯洁的心灵，健康的肉体和上帝赐予的一切。但是靠唯一的权利是保不住的，随后接回而至的是一匹浅色马，而马上骑士的名字则是死神，再后面已经是地狱了……我们遇在一起时，就讲这些，对她很有影响。”</p> 
<p>“您自己相信是这样吗？”公爵用奇怪的目光瞥了一眼列别杰夫，问。</p> 
<p>“我相信，也就这样解释。因为我是个穷光蛋，是人们循环轮转中的一个原子。谁会尊敬列别杰夫？人人都可以嘲笑他，人人几乎都可以踹他一脚。在这件事上，即解释语义方面，我跟王公贵族没什么两样。因为我有智慧！王公贵族即使领悟到，在我面前……坐在安乐椅上照样要颤抖。尼尔·阿列克谢耶维奇大人阁下两年前复活节前夕听说了（当时我还在他的司里当差），便通过彼得·扎哈雷奇特地要我从值班室到他自己办公室去，只剩下我们两人时问我：‘你是解释反基督者的专家，真的吗？’我没有隐瞒：‘是我’。我向他说了，阐述了，形容了，也没有减少恐惧的因素，而且。还展开比喻的画卷，故意加强这种色彩，引用了许多数字。大人他微微含笑，但是听到数字和类似的地方便会打颤，就要我合上书，打发我走。到复活节给我颁了奖赏，可是此后一星期他就去见上帝了。”</p> 
<p>“您在说什么，列别杰夫？”</p> 
<p>“正是这样。在一次午宴后他从马车里跌出来……太阳穴撞在路边矮石柱上，就像小孩一样，就像小孜一样，马上就上西天了。照履历表上算享年７３。在世时他满脸红光，一头银丝，全身洒遍香水，总是笑容可掬，像小孩的笑咪咪的。当时彼得·扎哈雷奇回忆说，‘这是你的预言。’”</p> 
<p>公爵站起身。列别杰夫很觉惊讶；甚至对公爵已经要起身告辞感到不知所措。</p> 
<p>“您变得很淡漠，嘻嘻！”他斗胆馅媚地说。</p> 
<p>“确实，我觉得不大舒服，我的头昏沉沉的，是旅途劳累了还是怎么的，”公爵皱着眉头回答。</p> 
<p>“您最好是去别墅，”列别杰夫怯生生地引着话题。</p> 
<p>公爵若有所思地站在那里。</p> 
<p>“我自己再等三天要带全家去别墅，</p>
