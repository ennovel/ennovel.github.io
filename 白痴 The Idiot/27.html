As usual the prince reproached himself, and had expected punishment, but he was inwardly convinced that Lizabetha Prokofievna could not be seriously angry with him, and that she probably was more angry with herself. He was painfully surprised, therefore, when three days passed with no word from her. Other things also troubled and perplexed him, and one of these grew more important in his eyes as the days went by. He had begun to blame himself for two opposite tendencies--on the one hand to extreme, almost "senseless," confidence in his fellows, on the other to a "vile, gloomy suspiciousness."</p> 
<p>By the end of the third day the incident of the eccentric lady and Evgenie Pavlovitch had attained enormous and mysterious proportions in his mind. He sorrowfully asked himself whether he had been the cause of this new "monstrosity," or was it ... but he refrained from saying who else might be in fault. As for the letters N.P.B., he looked on that as a harmless joke, a mere childish piece of mischief--so childish that he felt it would be shameful, almost dishonourable, to attach any importance to it.</p> 
<p>The day after these scandalous events, however, the prince had the honour of receiving a visit from Adelaida and her fiance, Prince S. They came, ostensibly, to inquire after his health. They had wandered out for a walk, and called in "by accident," and talked for almost the whole of the time they were with him about a certain most lovely tree in the park, which Adelaida had set her heart upon for a picture. This, and a little amiable conversation on Prince S.'s part, occupied the time, and not a word was said about last evening's episodes. At length Adelaida burst out laughing, apologized, and explained that they had come incognito; from which, and from the circumstance that they said nothing about the prince's either walking back with them or coming to see them later on, the latter inferred that he was in Mrs. Epanchin's black books. Adelaida mentioned a watercolour that she would much like to show him, and explained that she would either send it by Colia, or bring it herself the next day-- which to the prince seemed very suggestive.</p> 
<p>At length, however, just as the visitors were on the point of departing, Prince S. seemed suddenly to recollect himself. "Oh yes, by-the-by," he said, "do you happen to know, my dear Lef Nicolaievitch, who that lady was who called out to Evgenie Pavlovitch last night, from the carriage?"</p> 
<p>"It was Nastasia Philipovna," said the prince; "didn't you know that? I cannot tell you who her companion was."</p> 
<p>"But what on earth did she mean? I assure you it is a real riddle to me--to me, and to others, too!" Prince S. seemed to be under the influence of sincere astonishment.</p> 
<p>"She spoke of some bills of Evgenie Pavlovitch's," said the prince, simply, "which Rogojin had bought up from someone; and implied that Rogojin would not press him."</p> 
<p>"Oh, I heard that much, my dear fellow! But the thing is so impossibly absurd! A man of property like Evgenie to give IOU's to a money-lender, and to be worried about them! It is ridiculous. Besides, he cannot possibly be on such intimate terms with Nastasia Philipovna as she gave us to understand; that's the principal part of the mystery! He has given me his word that he knows nothing whatever about the matter, and of course I believe him. Well, the question is, my dear prince, do you know anything about it? Has any sort of suspicion of the meaning of it come across you?"</p> 
<p>"No, I know nothing whatever about it. I assure you I had nothing at all to do with it."</p> 
<p>"Oh, prince, how strange you have become! I assure you, I hardly know you for your old self. How can you suppose that I ever suggested you could have had a finger in such a business? But you are not quite yourself today, I can see." He embraced the prince, and kissed him.</p> 
<p>"What do you mean, though," asked Muishkin, "'by such a business'? I don't see any particular 'business' about it at all!"</p> 
<p>"Oh, undoubtedly, this person wished somehow, and for some reason, to do Evgenie Pavlovitch a bad turn, by attributing to him--before witnesses--qualities which he neither has nor can have," replied Prince S. drily enough.</p> 
<p>Muiskhin looked disturbed, but continued to gaze intently and questioningly into Prince S.'s face. The latter, however, remained silent.</p> 
<p>"Then it was not simply a matter of bills?" Muishkin said at last, with some impatience. "It was not as she said?"</p> 
<p>"But I ask you, my dear sir, how can there be anything in common between Evgenie Pavlovitch, and--her, and again Rogojin? I tell you he is a man of immense wealth--as I know for a fact; and he has further expectations from his uncle. Simply Nastasia Philipovna--"</p> 
<p>Prince S. paused, as though unwilling to continue talking about Nastasia Philipovna.</p> 
<p>"Then at all events he knows her!" remarked the prince, after a moment's silence.</p> 
<p>"Oh, that may be. He may have known her some time ago--two or three years, at least. He used to know Totski. But it is impossible that there should be any intimacy between them. She has not even been in the place--many people don't even know that she has returned from Moscow! I have only observed her carriage about for the last three days or so."</p> 
<p>"It's a lovely carriage," said Adelaida.</p> 
<p>"Yes, it was a beautiful turn-out, certainly!"</p> 
<p>The visitors left the house, however, on no less friendly terms than before. But the visit was of the greatest importance to the prince, from his own point of view. Admitting that he had his suspicions, from the moment of the occurrence of last night, perhaps even before, that Nastasia had some mysterious end in view, yet this visit confirmed his suspicions and justified his fears. It was all clear to him; Prince S. was wrong, perhaps, in his view of the matter, but he was somewhere near the truth, and was right in so far as that he understood there to be an intrigue of some sort going on. Perhaps Prince S. saw it all more clearly than he had allowed his hearers to understand. At all events, nothing could be plainer than that he and Adelaida had come for the express purpose of obtaining explanations, and that they suspected him of being concerned in the affair. And if all this were so, then SHE must have some terrible object in view! What was it? There was no stopping HER, as Muishkin knew from experience, in the performance of anything she had set her mind on! "Oh, she is mad, mad!" thought the poor prince.</p> 
<p>But there were many other puzzling occurrences that day, which required immediate explanation, and the prince felt very sad. A visit from Vera Lebedeff distracted him a little. She brought the infant Lubotchka with her as usual, and talked cheerfully for some time. Then came her younger sister, and later the brother, who attended a school close by. He informed Muishkin that his father had lately found a new interpretation of the star called "wormwood," which fell upon the water-springs, as described in the Apocalypse. He had decided that it meant the network of railroads spread over the face of Europe at the present time. The prince refused to believe that Lebedeff could have given such an interpretation, and they decided to ask him about it at the earliest opportunity. Vera related how Keller had taken up his abode with them on the previous evening. She thought he would remain for some time, as he was greatly pleased with the society of General Ivolgin and of the whole family. But he declared that he had only come to them in order to complete his education! The prince always enjoyed the company of Lebedeff's children, and today it was especially welcome, for Colia did not appear all day. Early that morning he had started for Petersburg. Lebedeff also was away on business. But Gavrila Ardalionovitch had promised to visit Muishkin, who eagerly awaited his coming.</p> 
<p>About seven in the evening, soon after dinner, he arrived. At the first glance it struck the prince that he, at any rate, must know all the details of last night's affair. Indeed, it would have been impossible for him to remain in ignorance considering the intimate relationship between him, Varvara Ardalionovna, and Ptitsin. But although he and the prince were intimate, in a sense, and although the latter had placed the Burdovsky affair in his hands-and this was not the only mark of confidence he had received--it seemed curious how many matters there were that were tacitly avoided in their conversations. Muishkin thought that Gania at times appeared to desire more cordiality and frankness. It was apparent now, when he entered, that he, was convinced that the moment for breaking the ice between them had come at last.</p> 
<p>But all the same Gania was in haste, for his sister was waiting at Lebedeff's to consult him on an urgent matter of business. If he had anticipated impatient questions, or impulsive confidences, he was soon undeceived. The prince was thoughtful, reserved, even a little absent-minded, and asked none of the questions--one in particular--that Gania had expected. So he imitated the prince's demeanour, and talked fast and brilliantly upon all subjects but the one on which their thoughts were engaged. Among other things Gania told his host that Nastasia Philipovna had been only four days in Pavlofsk, and that everyone was talking about her already. She was staying with Daria Alexeyevna, in an ugly little house in Mattrossky Street, but drove about in the smartest carriage in the place. A crowd of followers had pursued her from the first, young and old. Some escorted her on horse-back when she took the air in her carriage.</p> 
<p>She was as capricious as ever in the choice of her acquaintances, and admitted few into her narrow circle. Yet she already had a numerous following and many champions on whom she could depend in time of need. One gentleman on his holiday had broken off his engagement on her account, and an old general had quarrelled with his only son for the same reason.</p> 
<p>She was accompanied sometimes in her carriage by a girl of sixteen, a distant relative of her hostess. This young lady sang very well; in fact, her music had given a kind of notoriety to their little house. Nastasia, however, was behaving with great discretion on the whole. She dressed quietly, though with such taste as to drive all the ladies in Pavlofsk mad with envy, of that, as well as of her beauty and her carriage and horses.</p> 
<p>"As for yesterday's episode," continued Gania, "of course it was pre-arranged." Here he paused, as though expecting to be asked how he knew that. But the prince did not inquire. Concerning Evgenie Pavlovitch, Gania stated, without being asked, that he believed the former had not known Nastasia Philipovna in past years, but that he had probably been introduced to her by somebody in the park during these four days. As to the question of the IOU's she had spoken of, there might easily be something in that; for though Evgenie was undoubtedly a man of wealth, yet certain of his affairs were equally undoubtedly in disorder. Arrived at this interesting point, Gania suddenly broke off, and said no more about Nastasia's prank of the previous evening.</p> 
<p>At last Varvara Ardalionovna came in search of her brother, and remained for a few minutes. Without Muishkin's asking her, she informed him that Evgenie Pavlovitch was spending the day in Petersburg, and perhaps would remain there over tomorrow; and that her husband had also gone to town, probably in connection with Evgenie Pavlovitch's affairs.</p> 
<p>"Lizabetha Prokofievna is in a really fiendish temper today," she added, as she went out, "but the most curious thing is that Aglaya has quarrelled with her whole family; not only with her father and mother, but with her sisters also. It is not a good sign." She said all this quite casually, though it was extremely important in the eyes of the prince, and went off with her brother. Regarding the episode of "Pavlicheff's son," Gania had been absolutely silent, partly from a kind of false modesty, partly, perhaps, to "spare the prince's feelings." The latter, however, thanked him again for the trouble he had taken in the affair.</p> 
<p>Muishkin was glad enough to be left alone. He went out of the garden, crossed the road, and entered the park. He wished to reflect, and to make up his mind as to a certain "step." This step was one of those things, however, which are not thought out, as a rule, but decided for or against hastily, and without much reflection. The fact is, he felt a longing to leave all this and go away--go anywhere, if only it were far enough, and at once, without bidding farewell to anyone. He felt a presentiment that if he remained but a few days more in this place, and among these people, he would be fixed there irrevocably and permanently. However, in a very few minutes he decided that to run away was impossible; that it would be cowardly; that great problems lay before him, and that he had no right to leave them unsolved, or at least to refuse to give all his energy and strength to the attempt to solve them. Having come to this determination, he turned and went home, his walk having lasted less than a quarter of an hour. At that moment he was thoroughly unhappy.</p> 
<p>Lebedeff had not returned, so towards evening Keller managed to penetrate into the prince's apartments. He was not drunk, but in a confidential and talkative mood. He announced that he had come to tell the story of his life to Muishkin, and had only remained at Pavlofsk for that purpose. There was no means of turning him out; nothing short of an earthquake would have removed him.</p> 
<p>In the manner of one with long hours before him, he began his history; but after a few incoherent words he jumped to the conclusion, which was that "having ceased to believe in God Almighty, he had lost every vestige of morality, and had gone so far as to commit a theft." "Could you imagine such a thing?" said he.</p> 
<p>"Listen to me, Keller," returned the prince. "If I were in your place, I should not acknowledge that unless it were absolutely necessary for some reason. But perhaps you are making yourself out to be worse than you are, purposely?"</p> 
<p>"I should tell it to no one but yourself, prince, and I only name it now as a help to my soul's evolution. When I die, that secret will die with me! But, excellency, if you knew, if you only had the least idea, how difficult it is to get money nowadays! Where to find it is the question. Ask for a loan, the answer is always the same: 'Give us gold, jewels, or diamonds, and it will be quite easy.' Exactly what one has not got! Can you picture that to yourself? I got angry at last, and said, 'I suppose you would accept emeralds?' 'Certainly, we accept emeralds with pleasure. Yes!' 'Well, that's all right,' said I. 'Go to the devil, you den of thieves!' And with that I seized my hat, and walked out."</p> 
<p>"Had you any emeralds?" asked the prince.</p> 
<p>"What? I have emeralds? Oh, prince! with what simplicity, with what almost pastoral simplicity, you look upon life!"</p> 
<p>Could not something be made of this man under good influences? asked the prince of himself, for he began to feel a kind of pity for his visitor. He thought little of the value of his own personal influence, not from a sense of humility, but from his peculiar way of looking at things in general. Imperceptibly the conversation grew more animated and more interesting, so that neither of the two felt anxious to bring it to a close. Keller confessed, with apparent sincerity, to having been guilty of many acts of such a nature that it astonished the prince that he could mention them, even to him. At every fresh avowal he professed the deepest repentance, and described himself as being "bathed in tears"; but this did not prevent him from putting on a boastful air at times, and some of his stories were so absurdly comical that both he and the prince laughed like madmen.</p> 
<p>"One point in your favour is that you seem to have a child-like mind, and extreme truthfulness," said the prince at last. "Do you know that that atones for much?"</p> 
<p>"I am assuredly noble-minded, and chivalrous to a degree!" said Keller, much softened. "But, do you know, this nobility of mind exists in a dream, if one may put it so? It never appears in practice or deed. Now, why is that? I can never understand."</p> 
<p>"Do not despair. I think we may say without fear of deceiving ourselves, that you have now given a fairly exact account of your life. I, at least, think it would be impossible to add much to what you have just told me."</p> 
<p>"Impossible?" cried Keller, almost pityingly. "Oh prince, how little you really seem to understand human nature!"</p> 
<p>"Is there really much more to be added?" asked the prince, with mild surprise. "Well, what is it you really want of me? Speak out; tell me why you came to make your confession to me?"</p> 
<p>"What did I want? Well, to begin with, it is good to meet a man like you. It is a pleasure to talk over my faults with you. I know you for one of the best of men ... and then ... then ..."</p> 
<p>He hesitated, and appeared so much embarrassed that the prince helped him out.</p> 
<p>"Then you wanted me to lend you money?"</p> 
<p>The words were spoken in a grave tone, and even somewhat shyly.</p> 
<p>Keller started, gave an astonished look at the speaker, and thumped the table with his fist.</p> 
<p>"Well, prince, that's enough to knock me down! It astounds me! Here you are, as simple and innocent as a knight of the golden age, and yet ... yet ... you read a man's soul like a psychologist! Now, do explain it to me, prince, because I ... I really do not understand! ... Of course, my aim was to borrow money all along, and you ... you asked the question as if there was nothing blameable in it--as if you thought it quite natural."</p> 
<p>"Yes ... from you it is quite natural."</p> 
<p>"And you are not offended?"</p> 
<p>"Why should I be offended?"</p> 
<p>"Well, just listen, prince. I remained here last evening, partly because I have a great admiration for the French archbishop Bourdaloue. I enjoyed a discussion over him till three o'clock in the morning, with Lebedeff; and then ... then--I swear by all I hold sacred that I am telling you the truth--then I wished to develop my soul in this frank and heartfelt confession to you. This was my thought as I was sobbing myself to sleep at dawn. Just as I was losing consciousness, tears in my soul, tears on my face (I remember how I lay there sobbing), an idea from hell struck me. 'Why not, after confessing, borrow money from him?' You see, this confession was a kind of masterstroke; I intended to use it as a means to your good grace and favour--and then--then I meant to walk off with a hundred and fifty roubles. Now, do you not call that base?"</p>  
<p>The prince reddened slightly.</p> 
<p>"Bourdaloue, the archbishop, would not have spared a man like me," Keller continued, "but you, you have judged me with humanity. To show how grateful I am, and as a punishment, I will not accept a hundred and fifty roubles. Give me twenty-five--that will be enough; it is all I really need, for a fortnight at least. I will not ask you for more for a fortnight. I should like to have given Agatha a present, but she does not really deserve it. Oh, my dear prince, God bless you!"</p> 
<p>At this moment Lebedeff appeared, having just arrived from Petersburg. He frowned when he saw the twenty-five rouble note in Keller's hand, but the latter, having got the money, went away at once. Lebedeff began to abuse him.</p> 
<p>"You are unjust; I found him sincerely repentant," observed the prince, after listening for a time.</p> 
<p>"What is the good of repentance like that? It is the same exactly as mine yesterday, when I said, 'I am base, I am base,'--words, and nothing more!"</p> 
<p>"Then they were only words on your part? I thought, on the contrary..."</p> 
<p>"Well, I don't mind telling you the truth--you only! Because you see through a man somehow. Words and actions, truth and falsehood, are all jumbled up together in me, and yet I am perfectly sincere. I feel the deepest repentance, believe it or not, as you choose; but words and lies come out in the infernal craving to get the better of other people. It is always there--the notion of cheating people, and of using my repentant tears to my own advantage! I assure you this is the truth, prince! I would not tell any other man for the world! He would laugh and jeer at me--but you, you judge a man humanely."</p> 
<p>"Why, Keller said the same thing to me nearly word for word a few minutes ago!" cried Muishkin. "And you both seem inclined to boast about it! You astonish me, but I think he is more sincere than you, for you make a regular trade of it. Oh, don't put on that pathetic expression, and don't put your hand on your heart! Have you anything to say to me? You have not come for nothing..."</p> 
<p>Lebedeff grinned and wriggled.</p> 
<p>"I have been waiting all day for you, because I want to ask you a question; and, for once in your life, please tell me the truth at once. Had you anything to do with that affair of the carriage yesterday?"</p> 
<p>Lebedeff began to grin again, rubbed his hands, sneezed, but spoke not a word in reply.</p> 
<p>"I see you had something to do with it."</p> 
<p>"Indirectly, quite indirectly! I am speaking the truth--I am indeed! I merely told a certain person that I had people in my house, and that such and such personages might be found among them."</p> 
<p>"I am aware that you sent your son to that house--he told me so himself just now, but what is this intrigue?" said the prince, impatiently.</p> 
<p>"It is not my intrigue!" cried Lebedeff, waving his hand.</p> 
<p>"It was engineered by other people, and is, properly speaking, rather a fantasy than an intrigue!"</p> 
<p>"But what is it all about? Tell me, for Heaven's sake! Cannot you understand how nearly it touches me? Why are they blackening Evgenie Pavlovitch's reputation?"</p> 
<p>Lebedeff grimaced and wriggled again.</p> 
<p>"Prince!" said he. "Excellency! You won't let me tell you the whole truth; I have tried to explain; more than once I have begun, but you have not allowed me to go on..."</p> 
<p>The prince gave no answer, and sat deep in thought. Evidently he was struggling to decide.</p> 
<p>"Very well! Tell me the truth," he said, dejectedly.</p> 
<p>"Aglaya Ivanovna ..." began Lebedeff, promptly.</p> 
<p>"Be silent! At once!" interrupted the prince, red with indignation, and perhaps with shame, too. "It is impossible and absurd! All that has been invented by you, or fools like you! Let me never hear you say a word again on that subject!"</p> 
<p>Late in the evening Colia came in with a whole budget of Petersburg and Pavlofsk news. He did not dwell much on the Petersburg part of it, which consisted chiefly of intelligence about his friend Hippolyte, but passed quickly to the Pavlofsk tidings. He had gone straight to the Epanchins' from the station.</p> 
<p>"There's the deuce and all going on there!" he said. "First of all about the row last night, and I think there must be something new as well, though I didn't like to ask. Not a word about YOU, prince, the whole time!" The most interesting fact was that Aglaya had been quarrelling with her people about Gania. Colia did not know any details, except that it had been a terrible quarrel! Also Evgenie Pavlovitch had called, and met with an excellent reception all round. And another curious thing: Mrs. Epanchin was so angry that she called Varia to her--Varia was talking to the girls--and turned her out of the house "once for all "she said. "I heard it from Varia herself--Mrs. Epanchin was quite polite, but firm; and when Varia said good-bye to the girls, she told them nothing about it, and they didn't know they were saying goodbye for the last time. I'm sorry for Varia, and for Gania too; he isn't half a bad fellow, in spite of his faults, and I shall never forgive myself for not liking him before! I don't know whether I ought to continue to go to the Epanchins' now," concluded Colia--" I like to be quite independent of others, and of other people's quarrels if I can; but I must think over it."</p> 
<p>"I don't think you need break your heart over Gania," said the prince; "for if what you say is true, he must be considered dangerous in the Epanchin household, and if so, certain hopes of his must have been encouraged."</p> 
<p>"What? What hopes?" cried Colia; "you surely don't mean Aglaya?-- oh, no!--"</p> 
<p>"You're a dreadful sceptic, prince," he continued, after a moment's silence. "I have observed of late that you have grown sceptical about everything. You don't seem to believe in people as you did, and are always attributing motives and so on--am I using the word 'sceptic' in its proper sense?"</p> 
<p>"I believe so; but I'm not sure."</p> 
<p>"Well, I'll change it, right or wrong; I'll say that you are not sceptical, but JEALOUS. There! you are deadly jealous of Gania, over a certain proud damsel! Come!" Colia jumped up, with these words, and burst out laughing. He laughed as he had perhaps never laughed before, and still more when he saw the prince flushing up to his temples. He was delighted that the prince should be jealous about Aglaya. However, he stopped immediately on seeing that the other was really hurt, and the conversation continued, very earnestly, for an hour or more.</p> 
<p>Next day the prince had to go to town, on business. Returning in the afternoon, he happened upon General Epanchin at the station. The latter seized his hand, glancing around nervously, as if he were afraid of being caught in wrong-doing, and dragged him into a first-class compartment. He was burning to speak about something of importance.</p> 
<p>"In the first place, my dear prince, don't be angry with me. I would have come to see you yesterday, but I didn't know how Lizabetha Prokofievna would take it. My dear fellow, my house is simply a hell just now, a sort of sphinx has taken up its abode there. We live in an atmosphere of riddles; I can't make head or tail of anything. As for you, I feel sure you are the least to blame of any of us, though you certainly have been the cause of a good deal of trouble. You see, it's all very pleasant to be a philanthropist; but it can be carried too far. Of course I admire kind-heartedness, and I esteem my wife, but--"</p> 
<p>The general wandered on in this disconnected way for a long time; it was clear that he was much disturbed by some circumstance which he could make nothing of.</p> 
<p>"It is plain to me, that YOU are not in it at all," he continued, at last, a little less vaguely, "but perhaps you had better not come to our house for a little while. I ask you in the friendliest manner, mind; just till the wind changes again. As for Evgenie Pavlovitch," he continued with some excitement, "the whole thing is a calumny, a dirty calumny. It is simply a plot, an intrigue, to upset our plans and to stir up a quarrel. You see, prince, I'll tell you privately, Evgenie and ourselves have not said a word yet, we have no formal understanding, we are in no way bound on either side, but the word may be said very soon, don't you see, VERY soon, and all this is most injurious, and is meant to be so. Why? I'm sure I can't tell you. She's an extraordinary woman, you see, an eccentric woman; I tell you I am so frightened of that woman that I can't sleep. What a carriage that was, and where did it come from, eh? I declare, I was base enough to suspect Evgenie at first; but it seems certain that that cannot be the case, and if so, why is she interfering here? That's the riddle, what does she want? Is it to keep Evgenie to herself? But, my dear fellow, I swear to you, I swear he doesn't even KNOW her, and as for those bills, why, the whole thing is an invention! And the familiarity of the woman! It's quite clear we must treat the impudent creature's attempt with disdain, and redouble our courtesy towards Evgenie. I told my wife so.</p> 
<p>"Now I'll tell you my secret conviction. I'm certain that she's doing this to revenge herself on me, on account of the past, though I assure you that all the time I was blameless. I blush at the very idea. And now she turns up again like this, when I thought she had finally disappeared! Where's Rogojin all this time? I thought she was Mrs. Rogojin, long ago."</p> 
<p>The old man was in a state of great mental perturbation. The whole of the journey, which occupied nearly an hour, he continued in this strain, putting questions and answering them himself, shrugging his shoulders, pressing the prince's hand, and assuring the latter that, at all events, he had no suspicion whatever of HIM. This last assurance was satisfactory, at all events. The general finished by informing him that Evgenie's uncle was head of one of the civil service departments, and rich, very rich, and a gourmand. "And, well, Heaven preserve him, of course--but Evgenie gets his money, don't you see? But, for all this, I'm uncomfortable, I don't know why. There's something in the air, I feel there's something nasty in the air, like a bat, and I'm by no means comfortable."</p> 
<p>And it was not until the third day that the formal reconciliation between the prince and the Epanchins took place, as said before.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>直到第三天叶潘钦一家才完全平心静气下来。公爵虽然在许多方面通常都怪罪了自己，并真诚地期待着惩罚，但是开始他内心里依然怀着充分的信念，认为叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜不可能认真生他的气，而多半是生她自己的气。这样，这么长久的不和到了第三天已使公爵陷于茫然不知所措、郁郁寡欢的境地。造成这种境况的还有其他种种情形，但是其中一个情况是主要的。整整三天这一情况日益加重了公爵的疑心（不久前公爵谴责自己有两个极端，既责备自己那“毫无意义、令人讨厌的”异常的轻信，与此同时也责怪自己“阴鸳、卑劣的”的多疑）。总之，第三天快要结束的时候，从马车里跟叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇说话的那个古怪女士突然出现这件奇事，在他的头脑里则达到了令人害怕和神秘莫测的程度。这神秘莫测的实质，除了事情的其他诸多方面，对于公爵来说是一个可悲的问题：这件新的“荒唐之举”是否也正该归罪于他，或者仅仅……但是他没有说完还有谁。至于带Ｈ。印。B。三个字母的那个人之举，那么，在他看来，这纯粹不过是毫无恶意的淘气行为，甚至是十足孩子气的淘气行为，因此有一点点是她有错的想法也是惭愧的，在某个方面来说甚至是不正直的。</p> 
<p>不过，在那下成体统的“夜晚”（那晚乱糟糟，他是所谓罪魁祸首）后的第一天，公爵上午就很高兴地在自己家里接待了ω公爵和阿杰莱达：“他们来主要是为了打听一下他的健康”，他们俩是散步顺便来的。阿杰莱达刚才在公园里发现了一棵树，是一棵奇美的古树，树叶繁茂，枝权伸展，弯弯曲曲，树身上有窟窿和裂缝，可是满树绿茵茵的嫩叶。她一定要画这棵树，一定要画！在他们来访的整整半小时中她几乎就只谈这件事。ω公爵仍像往常一样和霭可亲，他问公爵过去的事，回忆他们第一次相识时的情景，对于昨天的事几乎一语不发，最后阿杰莱达忍不住了，苦笑着承认，他们是顺道而来， ｉｎｃｏｇｎｉｔｏ＊，但是她的承认也就至此为止，虽然从ｉｎｃｏｇｎｉｔｏ这个词已经可以看出，她父母，也就是说，主要是叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜眼下情绪特别不好。但是，无论是关于她，还是阿格拉娅，甚至伊万·费奥多罗维奇，阿杰菜达和ω公爵在这次拜访中却都只字未提。他们继续去散步，临走也没有邀请公爵同行。至于说请他去他们家，更是毫无表示；关于这一点阿杰莱达嘴里甚至冒出一句很能说明问题的后：在讲到她的一幅水彩画时，她突然表示很想给公爵看看这幅画。“怎么才能快点办这件事，等一等？如果科利亚来，我或者就让他给您送来，或者明天与公爵散步时我自己带来，”她终于结束了自己的困惑，并对于她能这么灵活而且对大家都合适地解决这个难题感到高兴。</p> 
<p>最后，几乎已经是告辞后，ω公爵像是突然回忆起似的说：</p> 
<p>“对了，”他问，“您是否知道，亲爱的列大·尼古拉耶维奇，昨天从马车里朝叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇喊叫的那个女人是什么人？”</p> 
<p>“这是纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜，”公爵说，“难道您还不知道这是她？跟她在一起的是谁，我却不知道。”</p> 
<p>“我知道，我听说过！”ω公爵接过话茬说，“但是这喊声是什么意思？我承认，对于我来说，这真是个谜……对于我和对于其他人来说都是。”</p> 
<p>ω公爵说话时明显带着一种异常惊讶的神情。</p> 
<p>“她说了叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇什么借据的事，”梅什金公爵非常简单地回答说，“这些借据从某个高利贷者那里落到了罗戈任手中，是因为她的请求，并说罗戈任将等叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇一段时间。”</p> 
<p>“我听到的，听到的，亲爱的公爵，要知道这是不可能的！叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇不可能有什么借据的！他拥有这么多的财产……确实，他过去发生过一些轻率的事，我甚至还帮过他摆脱困境……但是凭他有的财产却向高利贷者立借据并为此提心吊胆，这不可能。而且他也不可能对纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜说你，不可能与她有这般友好的关系。主要的谜就在这里。他发誓一点也不明白，我完全相信他。但问题在于，亲爱的公爵，我想问您，是否知道什么？也就是说，哪怕是有什么传闻奇迹般地传到您这儿。”</p> 
<p>＊意大利语：别人不知道的。</p> 
<p>“不，我什么也不知道，请您相信，我丝毫没有干预这件事。”</p> 
<p>“啊，公爵，瞧您成了什么人了！今天我简直不认得您了。难道我会认为您干预了这样的事？……算了，您今天情绪不佳。”</p> 
<p>他拥抱并吻了公爵。</p> 
<p>“干预什么样的‘这样的’事？我看不出任何‘这样的’事。”</p> 
<p>“毫无疑问，这个女人想以某种方式和在某个方面给叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇制造麻烦，当着人家的面强加给他本来没有也不可能有的品质，”ω公爵回答说，语气相当冷淡。</p> 
<p>列夫·尼古拉耶维奇公爵非常窘困，但是，他仍然疑问地凝视着公爵，但后者却缄默不语。</p> 
<p>“也许不仅仅是借据？不真正像昨天她说的那样？”公爵终于不耐烦地嘀咕说。“我对您说，您自己判断，可能在叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇和……她之间，加上罗戈任，有什么共同的东西？我再对你说一遍，他拥有巨大的财产，这点我完全知道；他还等着从伯父那里得到另一笔财产。不过是纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜……”</p> 
<p>ω公爵突然又闭口不语了，显然是因为他不想向公爵继续谈论纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜。</p> 
<p>“这么说，至少他是认识她的罗？”列夫·尼古拉耶维奇沉默了１分钟左右，突然问。</p> 
<p>“好像是这么回事，是个轻浮的人嘛！不过，即使有这回事，也已经是很久前了，是过去，也就是两三年前，要知道他跟托茨基也相识。现在可丝毫也不可能有这类事，他们从来也不可能用你相称！您自己知道，她一直不在这里，无论什么地方都不见她。许多人还不知道，她又出现了。我发现她马车也就是三天左右，不会更多。”</p> 
<p>“多么富丽堂皇的马车！”阿杰莱达说。</p> 
<p>“是的，马车很富丽堂皇。”</p> 
<p>他们俩走了，不过，可以说，他们是怀着对列夫·尼古拉耶维奇公爵最友好的兄弟般的好感离开的。</p> 
<p>而对我们的主人公来说这次拜访甚至包含着相当重大的意义。比方说，从昨天起（也许还更早）他自己也有许多疑惑，但是在他们来访以前他完全不取为自己的担忧辩解。现在则明白了：田公爵当然是错误地解释了事情，但终究已经徘徊在真相的周围了，他毕竟明白这里有阴谋。（“不过，也许他暗自完全正确地明白事情的真相，”公爵思忖着，“只不过不想说出来，因而故意作错误的解释。”）最明显的是，刚才他们来看他（而且正是田公爵），是希望他做出某些解释；如果是这样，那么他们简直就认为他参与了阴谋，此外，如果这一切真的这么重要，那么，看来她有某种可怕的目的，是什么目的呢？真可怕！“再说怎么阻止她呢？当她认定了自己的目的后，要制止她是丝毫不可能的！”公爵凭经验已经知道这一点。“真是疯了，疯了！”</p> 
<p>但是这个上午汇集拢来的其他悬而未决的问题是大多了，大多了，而且所有的问题都在同一个时间涌来，全都要求立即解决，因此公爵甚是忧心忡忡。维拉·列别杰娃抱了柳芭奇卡到他这儿来，笑着给他聊了好半天，稍微消解了他的愁思。跟着她来的是张大了嘴的妹妹，在她们后面则是列别杰大的中学生儿子。他要公爵相信，《启示录》里讲到的落到地面水源上的“茵陈星”，据他父亲阐释，就是分布欧洲的铁路网。公爵不相信列别杰夫是这样解释的，决定一有合适机会就问他本人。从维拉·列别杰娃那里公爵获悉，凯勒尔昨天起就到他们这儿来落脚，从所有的迹象来看，短期内他不会离开他们家，因为找到了伙伴，跟伊沃尔京将军交起朋友来了；不过，他声称，他留在他们那里唯一的目的是为了补充自己的教育，总的来说，列别杰夫的孩子们开始日益使公爵越来越喜欢。科利亚一整天都不在家：他一大早就去了波得堡。（列别杰夫也是天刚亮就去办自己的事了。）但是公爵迫不及待地等待的是加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇的来访，他今天非得来找公爵不可。</p> 
<p>他在下午６点多刚用餐后就来了。看了他第一眼，公爵就思忖，至少这位先生是应该正确无误地了解全部底细的。再说他有瓦尔瓦拉·阿尔达利翁诺夫娜及其丈夫这样的帮手，他怎么会不知道呢？但是公爵跟加尼亚的关系仍然有些特别。比如，公爵信托他办布尔多夫斯基这件事，是特别请求他办事；但是，尽管有这种信任和往昔的交情，在他们之间仍留有某些仿佛决定彼此绝不谈及的敏感点。公爵有时候觉得，从加尼亚这方面来说，他也许愿意以最彻底和友好的真诚相侍；例如现在，他刚走进来，公爵马上就觉得，加尼亚充满信心地认为，正是此刻该是打破他们之间在所有那些敏感点上的坚冰的时候，（可是加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇急于要走，他妹妹在列别杰夫那里等他；他俩急着要去办什么事。）</p> 
<p>但是如果加尼亚真的期待会有一连串迫不及待的问题、情下自禁的诉说、赤诚友情的坦露，那么他当然是错了，在他拜访的整个２０分钟过程中公爵甚至非常沉静，几乎心不在焉。原来期待他提出的许多问题，或者最好是说加尼亚等待他提出的主要问题，并没有提出来。于是加尼亚也就决定谈话时做较多的保留。他一刻不停他讲了整整２０分钟，一边笑着，一边很快地扯着一些最轻松愉快的闲话，可是却避而下谈主要的事。</p> 
<p>加尼亚只是顺便讲到，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜到帕夫洛夫斯克这里总共才四天，可是已经引起了大家的注意。她住在水手街某个地方一幢下怎么好的小房子里。是在达里娅·阿列克谢耶夫娜那里，而她的轻便马车几乎是帕夫洛夫斯克首屈一指的。她周围已经座集了一一大群老老少少的追求者；有时还有骑手伴送她的马车。纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜仍像以前那样非常挑剔，到她这儿来的都是经过选择的人。但是在她旁边仍然形成了一支队伍，逢到需要的时候总有人会站出来保护她，一位消夏的别墅客是个已订了婚约的未婚夫，为了纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜而跟自己的未婚妻吵架；一位将军老头为了她几乎诅咒自己的儿子。她常常把一个美妙的少女带在身边兜风，那少女刚１６岁，是达里娅·阿列克谢耶夫娜的远亲，她唱歌唱得很好，因此，每到夜晚她们的小屋，急吸引人们的注意。不过，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜操守非常规矩，穿得也不华丽，但异常有风度，所有的女士们都 “羡慕她的风度，美貌和马车”。</p> 
<p>“昨天那件怪事，”加尼亚低声说，“当然是有用意的，当然，是不应该计较的。要对她吹毛求疵什么的，那就得故意找她的碴儿，或者造谣中伤，不过，这也马上就会来的，”加尼亚结束道。他本来期待着公爵这时一定会问：“为什么他称昨天的那件事是有用意的、又为什么说那种事马上就会来的？”但是公爵却没有问。</p> 
<p>关于叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇的情况也是加尼亚自己说开的，没有特别的询问，这显得非常奇怪，因为他在谈话中插进这个话题是不伦不类的。照加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇的说法，叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇不认识纳斯塔西娅，向她介绍了他，恐怕一次也没有跟其他人一起去过她的家。关于借据的事，也是可能的（这一点加尼亚甚至知道得很肯定）叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇当然是有一份巨大的家财，但是“庄园方面的某些事务确实搞得乱七八糟”，在一个令人颇感兴趣的话题上，加尼亚却忽然住了口。关于纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜昨夜的出格的举动，除了前面顺便提到的，他没有再说一句话，后来瓦尔瓦拉·阿尔达利翁诺夫娜来找加尼亚，她呆了一会儿，也是未经询问就来的，说叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇今天，也可能明天，要去彼得堡，而她的丈夫（伊万·波得罗维奇·普季岑）也在彼得堡，也好像是为叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛丝奇的事，那边确实出了什么事。临走时，她又补充说，叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜今天心境极为恶劣，但最奇怪的是，阿格拉娅跟全家都吵遍了，不仅跟父亲母亲，而且连跟两个姐姐也吵架了，“这可完全不好。”仿佛是顺便告诉这最后一个消息（对于公爵来说却是极为意味深长的），兄妹俩便走了。有关“帕夫利谢夫儿子”的事，加涅奇卡也只字未提，也许是出于虚假的谦逊，可能是“顾惜公爵的感情”，但是公爵还是再一次感谢他尽力办完了这个事情。</p> 
<p>公爵非常高兴，终于只剩下他一个人了。他走下露台，穿过路径，走进了花园；他想好好思考一下，做出下一步的决定，但是这“一步”不是可以反复考虑的一步，而恰恰是不容斟酌、只能下决心干的一步，他忽然非常想撇下这里的一切，回到自己来的地方去，去遥远的僻静的地方，立即动身，甚至跟准都不告而别。他预感到，只要他在这里哪怕再呆上几天，就一定会无可挽回地被牵进这个圈子里去，并且这个圈子今后就将落在他身上。但是什么考虑还没有，１０分钟便当即做出决定，要逃走是“不可能的”，这几乎是畏缩怯懦，因为摆在他面前的这些难题，不去解决或者至少是不竭尽全力去解决现在他甚至没有丝毫权利可以这样做。带着这样的思绪他回到家，未必有一刻钟散步。此刻他完全是不幸的。</p> 
<p>列别杰夫仍然不在家，因而傍晚的时候凯勒尔得以闯到公爵这儿来。他没有喝醉，而是来吐露心曲和做自我表白的。他直截了当声称他来是向公爵匿讲述自己的一生，为此他才留在帕夫洛夫斯克的。要赶他走是没有一丝可能的：他是怎么也不会走的。凯勒尔本准备讲上很久，讲得也很不连贯，但是几乎刚开始说就突然跳到了结尾，并且说，他失去了“道德的所有幽灵”（纯粹是由于下信至高无上的上帝的缘故），以至曾经偷过东西。“您能想象到这点吗。”</p> 
<p>“听着，凯勒尔，要是我处在您的地位，没有特别的需要最好别做这样的自供，”公爵开始说，“不过，您也许是故意往自己身上抹黑？”</p> 
<p>“只对您，唯一对您一个人供认，只是为了帮助自己发展！再也不会告诉任何人；至死也要把我的秘密藏在白色？”衣下带去！但是，公爵，您要是能知道我们这个时代弄到钱有多难就好！说了这些，请间您，到哪儿去弄钱？只有一个回答：‘拿黄金和钻石来作抵押，我们就给，’也就是说，恰恰是我所没有的，您能想象这点吗？最后我生气了，就那么站在那里不走。‘绿宝石作抵押，给不给？’我说。‘绿宝石作抵押也给，’他说。‘好，好极了，’我说完，戴上帽子就走了出去；见你们的鬼，你们这帮无赖！真是这样！”</p> 
<p>“难道您有绿宝石？”</p> 
<p>“我哪有什么绿宝石！喏，公爵，您还以那么光明和天真的眼光，甚至可以说，用田园牧歌式的态度来看待生活！”</p> 
<p>最后，公爵与其说是怜惜，不如说是感到不好意思。他甚至闪过这么一个念头。“难道不能通过某个人的好影响使这个人做成什么事吗？”他认为鉴于某些原因自己的影响是完全不适用的，这并非是妄自菲薄，而是因为对事物的某种特殊的的看法。渐渐她他们谈得拢了，以至都不想分手了。凯勒尔异常情愿地承认了一些事情，简直令人不可想象，这些事情怎能讲得出口。每当开始讲一个故事前，他总是真正要你相信，他是多么悔恨，内心“充满泪水”，可是一讲起来则又仿佛为这些行为而自豪，同时，有时又显得那么可笑，乃至他和公爵最后都像疯了似的哈哈大笑。</p> 
<p>“主要的是，在您身上有一种孩子般的好信任感和不同寻常的诚实，”公爵最后说，“要知道，就凭这一点您就能补偿许多不足。”</p> 
<p>“气度高尚，气度高尚，骑士般的高尚气度。”凯勒尔非常感动地加以肯定，“但是，公爵，您要知道，一切仅是幻想，这么说吧，是海市蜃搂，实际上永远也不会有什么结果！为什么会这样？我无法理解。”</p> 
<p>“别失望。现在可以肯定地说，您向我和盘托出了您的全部底细；至少我觉得，对于您所讲的，现在已经不能再补充什么了，不是这样吗？”</p> 
<p>“不能？。”凯勒尔带着怜惜的口吻感叹说，“哦，公爵，您对人的理解在很大程度上可以说还是瑞士式的。”</p> 
<p>“难道还可以补充？”公爵惊讶而羞怯地说，“那么您期待从我这里得到什么呢？凯勒尔，请说吧，您来忏悔是为了什么？”</p> 
<p>“从您这里得到什么？期待什么？第一，单是望着您这副心地忠厚的样子就让人愉快，跟您一起坐一会，聊一聊，也让人心里高兴；至少我知道，我面前是位最具美德的人，而第二嘛……第二……”</p> 
<p>他语塞了，没有说下去。</p> 
<p>“也许，您是想借钱。”公爵非常认真和憨厚地提示说，甚至还有点羞怯。</p> 
<p>凯特尔猛然一震；他带着先前的惊讶直盯着公爵的眼睛很快地瞥了一眼，用拳头重重地猛击了一下桌子。</p> 
<p>“嘿，您这一着可真把人搞槽了！得了吧，公爵，像您这样单纯忠厚，这样天真纯朴，就是在黄金时代也没有听说过，同时，您又用这样深刻的心理观察像利箭一般一下子把人刺穿了。但是，请原谅，公爵，这需要解释，因为我……我简直弄糊涂了！当然，说到底，我的目的是借钱，但是您问我借钱的事时，仿佛并不认为这是应受谴责的，而认为这是应该似的。”</p> 
<p>“是的……从您来说这是应该的。”</p> 
<p>“您不气忿吗。”</p> 
<p>“是的……有什么可气忿的呢。”</p> 
<p>“听着，公爵，昨晚起我就留在这儿了，第一，是出于对法国大主教布尔达鲁＊（我们在列别杰夫那里干了一瓶又一瓶直喝到３点钟）有着特别的敬意，第二，主要的，我可以画十字起誓，我说的是千真万确的真话！），我之所以留下来，这么说吧，是想向您做全部的诚心诚意的忏晦，以此来促进自己的成长，我就带着这样的想法泪流满面地在３点多钟睡着了，您现在相信一个正人君子吗、在我入睡那一刻，真正充满了内心的泪水，可以说，也泪流满面（因为最后我号啕大哭）”，我记得这一点！），我冒出了一个可恶的念头：‘怎么，在作过忏悔以后，来了不问他借点钱吗。”这样，我就准备好了忏悔，这么说吧，犹如一道‘泪汁肉丁’，目的就为了让这这些泪水泡软通路，使您感化以后数给我１５０卢布。在您看来，这不卑鄙吗。”</p> 
<p>“可是这大概不是真话，而不过是一件下跟另一件事碰到一起了，两个念头汇合到一起，这是常会发生的情况。我就不断出现这种情况，不过，我认为这下好，您要知道，凯勒尔；在这点上我首先总是责备自己。您现在向我讲的就像是我自己的事、我有时候甚至认为，”公爵很严肃、真诚和饶有兴味地继续说，“所有的人都是这样的，于是我就开始赞许自己，因为要跟这两种念头作斗争困难得不得了，我有体验。上帝才知道，这两种念头怎么来的；怎么产生的。您就直截了当称这是卑鄙！现在我又将开始怕这些念头。无论怎么样，我不是您的法官。但是，据我看，终究不能就这么直截了当地称之为卑鄙，您怎么想？您耍滑头，想通过眼泪来骗取钱财，但是您可是自己起誓，说您的忏梅还有别的目的，是高尚的目的，而不单是弄钱的目的；至于说到钱，您需要它们可是用来纵酒，是吗？但是，在这样的忏梅以后这自纵是意志薄弱的行为。然而，一下子又怎么能抛弃酗酒呢？这是不可能的。怎么办？最好还是留给您自己的良心去考虑，您认为怎样？”</p> 
<p>＊布尔达鲁和波尔多（法国葡萄酒名）两词发音相近。此处系凯勒尔戏称。</p> 
<p>公爵异常好奇地望着凯勒尔。关于两种念头的问题显然早已占据了他的思想。</p> 
<p>“嘿，听您这么说以后，我真不明白，为什么人家要称您是白痴？”凯勒尔喊着说。</p> 
<p>公爵微微红了脸。</p> 
<p>“布尔达鲁大主教也不会宽恕人的，而您却宽恕人，而且富有同情心地评判我：为了惩戒自己和表明我受了感动，现在我不想要１５０卢布了，只要给我２５卢布就够了！我所需要的就这些，至少可以过两个星期。不到两个星期我不会来要钱，我原想让阿加什卡高兴高兴，但是她不配。啊，亲爱的公爵，愿上帝祝福您！”</p> 
<p>最后，列别杰夫进来了。他刚刚回来，发现凯勒尔手中有２５卢布，便皱了下眉头，但是拿到了钱的凯勒尔已经急着要走了并且立即溜之大吉。列别杰夫马上就开始说起他的坏话来。</p> 
<p>“您不公正，他确实真心诚意悔过，”最后公爵指出。</p> 
<p>“要知道这算什么悔过呀！就跟我昨天说‘我卑鄙，我卑鄙’一模一样，可只是说说而已！”</p> 
<p>“这么说您只是说说而已，而我本来以为……”</p> 
<p>“好吧，这就对您，就对您一个人说真话，因为您能洞察一个人：说也罢，做也罢，谎言也罢，真话也罢，这一切在我身上全是混在一起的，并且也完全是真诚的，真话和行动于我便是真诚的悔过，信不信由您，我可以起誓，而说空话和谎言则是可恶的（且总是存在的）念头，怎么诱人上钩，怎么通过悔恨的泪水来赢得好处！真的，是这样的！对别人我是下会说的，因为会遭到他嘲笑或唾弃；但是，公爵，您会富有同情心地做出评判。”</p> 
<p>“瞧，就跟刚才他对我说的一模一样。”公爵高声喊了起来，“而且你们俩像是在自我吹嘘！你们甚至使我感到谅讶，只不过他比您来得真诚，而您将此完全变成了一种职业。得了，够了，别皱眉头，列别杰夫，也不用把手放到心口。您不要对我说什么呜？您是不会白白上这儿来的……”</p> 
<p>列别杰夫拱肩曲背，扭捏作态。</p> 
<p>“我等了您整整一天，想向您提一个问题，请回答我，哪怕一生中说这一次真话：您是否多少参与了与昨晚马车有关的事？”</p> 
<p>列别杰夫又扭扭捏捏，开始嘻嘻笑起来，不停地搓着双手，最后甚至接连打起喷嚏来，但依然还是没有勇气说出话来。</p> 
<p>“我看得出，您是参与的。”</p> 
<p>“但是间接的，纯粹只是间接的！我说的是老实话！我参与的只是及时让那个女人知道，我家聚集着这么一伙人以及有些人在场。”</p> 
<p>“我知道，您派自己的儿子到那里去过，他刚才自己对我说的，但是这是个什么阴谋呀！”公爵不耐烦地感叹说。</p> 
<p>“这不是我的阴谋，不是我的阴谋，”列别杰夫连连挥手加以否定，“这事是别的人搞的，别的人，而且与其说是阴谋，不如说是突发奇想。”</p> 
<p>“到底是怎么回事？看在基督面上，您给解释清楚！难道您不明白，这是直接牵涉到我的？要知道这是在给叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇抹黑。”</p> 
<p>“公爵，最尊敬的公爵！”列别杰夫又作出拱肩曲背状，“这可是您不许讲出全部真情的，我不是已经开始向您讲真实情况了吗？不止一次，而您不许我讲下去……”</p> 
<p>公爵沉默不语，思考了一会。</p> 
<p>“那好吧，您讲真相吧，”他沉重地说，显然是经过了激烈的思想斗争。</p> 
<p>“阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜……”列别杰夫马上开始说。</p> 
<p>“闭嘴，闭嘴！”公爵发狂地喊了起来，气愤得满脸通红，也许还用为感到羞耻。“这不可能，这是胡说！这一切是您自己或者是如您这样的疯子杜撰出来的。永远再也不要让我从您那里听到这样的话！”</p> 
<p>夜晚已经１０点多的时候科利亚带了一大堆消息来了，他的消息有两个方面：彼得堡的和帕夫洛夫斯克的。他急忙把彼得堡方面主要的消息先讲了（大部分是关于伊波利特和昨天的事）为了是待会儿再转过来谈，所以赶快转到帕夫洛夫斯克的消息。３小时前他从彼得堡回来，没有到公爵这里来，径直就去了叶潘钦家。“那里的情况简直槽透了！”当然，马车的事是头等的，但是这里面大概还有什么名堂，还有什么他和公爵都不知道的事。“我当然不是密探，也不想向谁打听；不过对我的接待很好，好到甚至出平我的意料，但是对您公爵却只字未提。”最主要和耐人寻味的是，阿格拉娅刚才为了加尼亚跟家里人吵了一顿，事情的详细情况不知道，但就是为了加尼亚（您能想象这点吗！），而且还吵得很凶，看来是有什么要紧的事。将军来得很晚，一副闷闷不乐的样子。叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇跟他一起来的，受到了非常好的接待，而他自己也出奇地快活和可爱。最重大的消息是，叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜不露声色地把坐在小姐们那儿聊大的瓦尔瓦拉·阿尔达利翁诺夫娜叫到自己那里，把她永远赶出自己的家，不过，她采取的却是最客气的方式，这是“从瓦里娅本人那儿听说的”。但是，瓦里娅从叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜那儿出来并跟小姐们告辞的时候，她们却并不知道，她已被永远拒之家门外，这是与她们最后一次作别。</p> 
<p>“但是瓦尔瓦拉·阿尔达利翁夫娜７点钟时曾经在我这儿的吧？”公爵惊讶地问。</p> 
<p>“而赶她走是在７点多或者８点钟。我很可怜瓦里娅，可怜加尼亚……无疑，他们永远在搞诡计，不这样他们是不可能的。而我从来也无法知道，他们在谋划什么，也不想知道。但是请您相信，我亲爱的善良的公爵，加尼亚是有良心的。这个人在许多方面当然是沉沦的，但是在他身上也有许多方面存在着值得寻找的品质，我永远不能原谅自己的是，过去没有理解他……我不知道，在发生瓦里娅这件事后，现在我是否应该继续去那里。说真的，从一开始我就使自己处于完全独立和单独的地位，但是毕竟应该好好想想。”</p> 
<p>“您过分怜惜兄长是徒然的，”公爵向他指出，“既然事情已经到了那一步，那么加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇在叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜眼里是个危险人物，因此，他的某些希望正在确立。”</p> 
<p>“怎么，什么希望！”科利亚惊诧地喊了起来，“难道您认为，阿格拉娅……这不可能。”</p> 
<p>公爵不吭声了。</p> 
<p>“您是个可怕的怀疑论者，公爵，”过了两分钟科利亚补说，“我发现，从某个时候起您成了个异常好怀疑的人；您开始什么都不相信并且对一都进行揣测……这种情况下我用‘怀疑论者’这个词正确吗？”</p> 
<p>“我想是正确的，虽然我自己其实也不知道。”</p> 
<p>“但是我自己不采用‘怀疑论者’这个词，我找到了新的解释，”科利亚突然喊了起来，“您不是怀疑论者，而是个嫉妒者！您极力嫉妒加尼亚爱那位高傲的小姐！”</p>
