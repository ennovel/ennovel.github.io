He seemed confused and almost at a loss.</p> 
<p>"Just look, Lizabetha Prokofievna," he began, with a kind of feverish haste; "these china cups are supposed to be extremely valuable. Lebedeff always keeps them locked up in his china- cupboard; they were part of his wife's dowry. Yet he has brought them out tonight--in your honour, of course! He is so pleased--" He was about to add something else, but could not find the words.</p> 
<p>"There, he is feeling embarrassed; I expected as much," whispered Evgenie Pavlovitch suddenly in the prince's ear. "It is a bad sign; what do you think? Now, out of spite, he will come out with something so outrageous that even Lizabetha Prokofievna will not be able to stand it."</p> 
<p>Muishkin looked at him inquiringly.</p> 
<p>"You do not care if he does?" added Evgenie Pavlovitch. "Neither do I; in fact, I should be glad, merely as a proper punishment for our dear Lizabetha Prokofievna. I am very anxious that she should get it, without delay, and I shall stay till she does. You seem feverish."</p> 
<p>"Never mind; by-and-by; yes, I am not feeling well," said the prince impatiently, hardly listening. He had just heard Hippolyte mention his own name.</p> 
<p>"You don't believe it?" said the invalid, with a nervous laugh. "I don't wonder, but the prince will have no difficulty in believing it; he will not be at all surprised."</p> 
<p>"Do you hear, prince--do you hear that?" said Lizabetha Prokofievna, turning towards him.</p> 
<p>There was laughter in the group around her, and Lebedeff stood before her gesticulating wildly.</p> 
<p>"He declares that your humbug of a landlord revised this gentleman's article--the article that was read aloud just now--in which you got such a charming dressing-down."</p> 
<p>The prince regarded Lebedeff with astonishment.</p> 
<p>"Why don't you say something?" cried Lizabetha Prokofievna, stamping her foot.</p> 
<p>"Well," murmured the prince, with his eyes still fixed on Lebedeff, "I can see now that he did."</p> 
<p>"Is it true?" she asked eagerly.</p> 
<p>"Absolutely, your excellency," said Lebedeff, without the least hesitation.</p> 
<p>Mrs. Epanchin almost sprang up in amazement at his answer, and at the assurance of his tone.</p> 
<p>"He actually seems to boast of it!" she cried.</p> 
<p>"I am base--base!" muttered Lebedeff, beating his breast, and hanging his head.</p> 
<p>"What do I care if you are base or not? He thinks he has only to say, 'I am base,' and there is an end of it. As to you, prince, are you not ashamed?--I repeat, are you not ashamed, to mix with such riff-raff? I will never forgive you!"</p> 
<p>"The prince will forgive me!" said Lebedeff with emotional conviction.</p> 
<p>Keller suddenly left his seat, and approached Lizabetha. Prokofievna.</p> 
<p>"It was only out of generosity, madame," he said in a resonant voice, "and because I would not betray a friend in an awkward position, that I did not mention this revision before; though you heard him yourself threatening to kick us down the steps. To clear the matter up, I declare now that I did have recourse to his assistance, and that I paid him six roubles for it. But I did not ask him to correct my style; I simply went to him for information concerning the facts, of which I was ignorant to a great extent, and which he was competent to give. The story of the gaiters, the appetite in the Swiss professor's house, the substitution of fifty roubles for two hundred and fifty--all such details, in fact, were got from him. I paid him six roubles for them; but he did not correct the style."</p> 
<p>"I must state that I only revised the first part of the article," interposed Lebedeff with feverish impatience, while laughter rose from all around him; "but we fell out in the middle over one idea, so I never corrected the second part. Therefore I cannot be held responsible for the numerous grammatical blunders in it."</p> 
<p>"That is all he thinks of!" cried Lizabetha Prokofievna.</p> 
<p>"May I ask when this article was revised?" said Evgenie Pavlovitch to Keller.</p> 
<p>"Yesterday morning," he replied, "we had an interview which we all gave our word of honour to keep secret."</p> 
<p>"The very time when he was cringing before you and making protestations of devotion! Oh, the mean wretches! I will have nothing to do with your Pushkin, and your daughter shall not set foot in my house!"</p> 
<p>Lizabetha Prokofievna was about to rise, when she saw Hippolyte laughing, and turned upon him with irritation.</p> 
<p>"Well, sir, I suppose you wanted to make me look ridiculous?"</p> 
<p>"Heaven forbid!" he answered, with a forced smile. "But I am more than ever struck by your eccentricity, Lizabetha Prokofievna. I admit that I told you of Lebedeff's duplicity, on purpose. I knew the effect it would have on you,--on you alone, for the prince will forgive him. He has probably forgiven him already, and is racking his brains to find some excuse for him--is not that the truth, prince?"</p> 
<p>He gasped as he spoke, and his strange agitation seemed to increase.</p> 
<p>"Well?" said Mrs. Epanchin angrily, surprised at his tone; "well, what more?"</p> 
<p>"I have heard many things of the kind about you ...they delighted me... I have learned to hold you in the highest esteem," continued Hippolyte.</p> 
<p>His words seemed tinged with a kind of sarcastic mockery, yet he was extremely agitated, casting suspicious glances around him, growing confused, and constantly losing the thread of his ideas. All this, together with his consumptive appearance, and the frenzied expression of his blazing eyes, naturally attracted the attention of everyone present.</p> 
<p>"I might have been surprised (though I admit I know nothing of the world), not only that you should have stayed on just now in the company of such people as myself and my friends, who are not of your class, but that you should let these ... young ladies listen to such a scandalous affair, though no doubt novel-reading has taught them all there is to know. I may be mistaken; I hardly know what I am saying; but surely no one but you would have stayed to please a whippersnapper (yes, a whippersnapper; I admit it) to spend the evening and take part in everything--only to be ashamed of it tomorrow. (I know I express myself badly.) I admire and appreciate it all extremely, though the expression on the face of his excellency, your husband, shows that he thinks it very improper. He-he!" He burst out laughing, and was seized with a fit of coughing which lasted for two minutes and prevented him from speaking.</p> 
<p>"He has lost his breath now!" said Lizabetha Prokofievna coldly, looking at him with more curiosity than pity: "Come, my dear boy, that is quite enough--let us make an end of this."</p> 
<p>Ivan Fedorovitch, now quite out of patience, interrupted suddenly. "Let me remark in my turn, sir," he said in tones of deep annoyance, "that my wife is here as the guest of Prince Lef Nicolaievitch, our friend and neighbour, and that in any case, young man, it is not for you to pass judgment on the conduct of Lizabetha Prokofievna, or to make remarks aloud in my presence concerning what feelings you think may be read in my face. Yes, my wife stayed here," continued the general, with increasing irritation, "more out of amazement than anything else. Everyone can understand that a collection of such strange young men would attract the attention of a person interested in contemporary life. I stayed myself, just as I sometimes stop to look on in the street when I see something that may be regarded as-as-as-"</p> 
<p>"As a curiosity," suggested Evgenie Pavlovitch, seeing his excellency involved in a comparison which he could not complete.</p> 
<p>"That is exactly the word I wanted," said the general with satisfaction--" a curiosity. However, the most astonishing and, if I may so express myself, the most painful, thing in this matter, is that you cannot even understand, young man, that Lizabetha Prokofievna, only stayed with you because you are ill, --if you really are dying--moved by the pity awakened by your plaintive appeal, and that her name, character, and social position place her above all risk of contamination. Lizabetha Prokofievna!" he continued, now crimson with rage, "if you are coming, we will say goodnight to the prince, and--"</p> 
<p>"Thank you for the lesson, general," said Hippolyte, with unexpected gravity, regarding him thoughtfully.</p> 
<p>"Two minutes more, if you please, dear Ivan Fedorovitch," said Lizabetha Prokofievna to her husband; "it seems to me that he is in a fever and delirious; you can see by his eyes what a state he is in; it is impossible to let him go back to Petersburg tonight. Can you put him up, Lef Nicolaievitch? I hope you are not bored, dear prince," she added suddenly to Prince S. "Alexandra, my dear, come here! Your hair is coming down."</p> 
<p>She arranged her daughter's hair, which was not in the least disordered, and gave her a kiss. This was all that she had called her for.</p> 
<p>"I thought you were capable of development," said Hippolyte, coming out of his fit of abstraction. "Yes, that is what I meant to say," he added, with the satisfaction of one who suddenly remembers something he had forgotten. "Here is Burdovsky, sincerely anxious to protect his mother; is not that so? And he himself is the cause of her disgrace. The prince is anxious to help Burdovsky and offers him friendship and a large sum of money, in the sincerity of his heart. And here they stand like two sworn enemies--ha, ha, ha! You all hate Burdovsky because his behaviour with regard to his mother is shocking and repugnant to you; do you not? Is not that true? Is it not true? You all have a passion for beauty and distinction in outward forms; that is all you care for, isn't it? I have suspected for a long time that you cared for nothing else! Well, let me tell you that perhaps there is not one of you who loved your mother as Burdovsky loved his. As to you, prince, I know that you have sent money secretly to Burdovsky's mother through Gania. Well, I bet now," he continued with an hysterical laugh, "that Burdovsky will accuse you of indelicacy, and reproach you with a want of respect for his mother! Yes, that is quite certain! Ha, ha, ha!"</p> 
<p>He caught his breath, and began to cough once more.</p> 
<p>"Come, that is enough! That is all now; you have no more to say? Now go to bed; you are burning with fever," said Lizabetha Prokofievna impatiently. Her anxious eyes had never left the invalid. "Good heavens, he is going to begin again!"</p> 
<p>"You are laughing, I think? Why do you keep laughing at me?" said Hippolyte irritably to Evgenie Pavlovitch, who certainly was laughing.</p> 
<p>"I only want to know, Mr. Hippolyte--excuse me, I forget your surname."</p> 
<p>"Mr. Terentieff," said the prince.</p> 
<p>"Oh yes, Mr. Terentieff. Thank you prince. I heard it just now, but had forgotten it. I want to know, Mr. Terentieff, if what I have heard about you is true. It seems you are convinced that if you could speak to the people from a window for a quarter of an hour, you could make them all adopt your views and follow you?"</p> 
<p>"I may have said so," answered Hippolyte, as if trying to remember. "Yes, I certainly said so," he continued with sudden animation, fixing an unflinching glance on his questioner. "What of it?"</p> 
<p>"Nothing. I was only seeking further information, to put the finishing touch." Evgenie Pavlovitch was silent, but Hippolyte kept his eyes fixed upon him, waiting impatiently for more.</p> 
<p>"Well, have you finished?" said Lizabetha Prokofievna to Evgenie. "Make haste, sir; it is time he went to bed. Have you more to say?" She was very angry.</p> 
<p>"Yes, I have a little more," said Evgenie Pavlovitch, with a smile. "It seems to me that all you and your friends have said, Mr. Terentieff, and all you have just put forward with such undeniable talent, may be summed up in the triumph of right above all, independent of everything else, to the exclusion of everything else; perhaps even before having discovered what constitutes the right. I may be mistaken?"</p> 
<p>"You are certainly mistaken; I do not even understand you. What else?"</p> 
<p>Murmurs arose in the neighbourhood of Burdovsky and his companions; Lebedeff's nephew protested under his breath.</p> 
<p>"I have nearly finished," replied Evgenie Pavlovitch.</p> 
<p>"I will only remark that from these premisses one could conclude that might is right--I mean the right of the clenched fist, and of personal inclination. Indeed, the world has often come to that conclusion. Prudhon upheld that might is right. In the American War some of the most advanced Liberals took sides with the planters on the score that the blacks were an inferior race to the whites, and that might was the right of the white race."</p> 
<p>"Well?"</p> 
<p>"You mean, no doubt, that you do not deny that might is right?"</p> 
<p>"What then?"</p> 
<p>"You are at least logical. I would only point out that from the right of might, to the right of tigers and crocodiles, or even Daniloff and Gorsky, is but a step."</p> 
<p>"I know nothing about that; what else?"</p> 
<p>Hippolyte was scarcely listening. He kept saying well?" and "what else?" mechanically, without the least curiosity, and by mere force of habit.</p> 
<p>"Why, nothing else; that is all."</p> 
<p>"However, I bear you no grudge," said Hippolyte suddenly, and, hardly conscious of what he was doing, he held out his hand with a smile. The gesture took Evgenie Pavlovitch by surprise, but with the utmost gravity he touched the hand that was offered him in token of forgiveness.</p> 
<p>"I can but thank you," he said, in a tone too respectful to be sincere, "for your kindness in letting me speak, for I have often noticed that our Liberals never allow other people to have an opinion of their own, and immediately answer their opponents with abuse, if they do not have recourse to arguments of a still more unpleasant nature."</p> 
<p>"What you say is quite true," observed General Epanchin; then, clasping his hands behind his back, he returned to his place on the terrace steps, where he yawned with an air of boredom.</p> 
<p>"Come, sir, that will do; you weary me," said Lizabetha Prokofievna suddenly to Evgenie Pavlovitch.</p> 
<p>Hippolyte rose all at once, looking troubled and almost frightened.</p> 
<p>"It is time for me to go," he said, glancing round in perplexity. "I have detained you... I wanted to tell you everything... I thought you all ... for the last time ... it was a whim..."</p> 
<p>He evidently had sudden fits of returning animation, when he awoke from his semi-delirium; then, recovering full self- possession for a few moments, he would speak, in disconnected phrases which had perhaps haunted him for a long while on his bed of suffering, during weary, sleepless nights.</p> 
<p>"Well, good-bye," he said abruptly. "You think it is easy for me to say good-bye to you? Ha, ha!"</p> 
<p>Feeling that his question was somewhat gauche, he smiled angrily. Then as if vexed that he could not ever express what he really meant, he said irritably, in a loud voice:</p> 
<p>"Excellency, I have the honour of inviting you to my funeral; that is, if you will deign to honour it with your presence. I invite you all, gentlemen, as well as the general."</p> 
<p>He burst out laughing again, but it was the laughter of a madman. Lizabetha Prokofievna approached him anxiously and seized his arm. He stared at her for a moment, still laughing, but soon his face grew serious.</p> 
<p>"Do you know that I came here to see those trees?" pointing to the trees in the park. "It is not ridiculous, is it? Say that it is not ridiculous!" he demanded urgently of Lizabetha Prokofievna. Then he seemed to be plunged in thought. A moment later he raised his head, and his eyes sought for someone. He was looking for Evgenie Pavlovitch, who was close by on his right as before, but he had forgotten this, and his eyes ranged over the assembled company. "Ah! you have not gone!" he said, when he caught sight of him at last. "You kept on laughing just now, because I thought of speaking to the people from the window for a quarter of an hour. But I am not eighteen, you know; lying on that bed, and looking out of that window, I have thought of all sorts of things for such a long time that ... a dead man has no age, you know. I was saying that to myself only last week, when I was awake in the night. Do you know what you fear most? You fear our sincerity more than anything, although you despise us! The idea crossed my mind that night... You thought I was making fun of you just now, Lizabetha Prokofievna? No, the idea of mockery was far from me; I only meant to praise you. Colia told me the prince called you a child--very well--but let me see, I had something else to say..." He covered his face with his hands and tried to collect his thoughts.</p> 
<p>"Ah, yes--you were going away just now, and I thought to myself: 'I shall never see these people again-never again! This is the last time I shall see the trees, too. I shall see nothing after this but the red brick wall of Meyer's house opposite my window. Tell them about it--try to tell them,' I thought. 'Here is a beautiful young girl--you are a dead man; make them understand that. Tell them that a dead man may say anything--and Mrs. Grundy will not be angry--ha-ha! You are not laughing?" He looked anxiously around. "But you know I get so many queer ideas, lying there in bed. I have grown convinced that nature is full of mockery--you called me an atheist just now, but you know this nature ... why are you laughing again? You are very cruel!" he added suddenly, regarding them all with mournful reproach. "I have not corrupted Colia," he concluded in a different and very serious tone, as if remembering something again.</p> 
<p>"Nobody here is laughing at you. Calm yourself" said Lizabetha Prokofievna, much moved. "You shall see a new doctor tomorrow; the other was mistaken; but sit down, do not stand like that! You are delirious--Oh, what shall we do with him she cried in anguish, as she made him sit down again in the arm-chair.</p> 
<p>A tear glistened on her cheek. At the sight of it Hippolyte seemed amazed. He lifted his hand timidly and, touched the tear with his finger, smiling like a child.</p>  
<p>"Oh! what on earth are we to do with him?" cried Lizabetha Prokofievna. She hastened to him and pressed his head against her bosom, while he sobbed convulsively.</p> 
<p>"Come, come, come! There, you must not cry, that will do. You are a good child! God will forgive you, because you knew no better. Come now, be a man! You know presently you will be ashamed."</p> 
<p>Hippolyte raised his head with an effort, saying:</p> 
<p>"I have little brothers and sisters, over there, poor avid innocent. She will corrupt them! You are a saint! You are a child yourself--save them! Snatch them from that ... she is ... it is shameful! Oh! help them! God will repay you a hundredfold. For the love of God, for the love of Christ!"</p> 
<p>"Speak, Ivan Fedorovitch! What are we to do?" cried Lizabetha Prokofievna, irritably. "Please break your majestic silence! I tell you, if you cannot come to some decision, I will stay here all night myself. You have tyrannized over me enough, you autocrat!"</p> 
<p>She spoke angrily, and in great excitement, and expected an immediate reply. But in such a case, no matter how many are present, all prefer to keep silence: no one will take the initiative, but all reserve their comments till afterwards. There were some present--Varvara Ardalionovna, for instance--who would have willingly sat there till morning without saying a word. Varvara had sat apart all the evening without opening her lips, but she listened to everything with the closest attention; perhaps she had her reasons for so doing.</p> 
<p>"My dear," said the general, "it seems to me that a sick-nurse would be of more use here than an excitable person like you. Perhaps it would be as well to get some sober, reliable man for the night. In any case we must consult the prince, and leave the patient to rest at once. Tomorrow we can see what can be done for him."</p> 
<p>"It is nearly midnight; we are going. Will he come with us, or is he to stay here?" Doktorenko asked crossly of the prince.</p> 
<p>"You can stay with him if you like," said Muishkin.</p> 
<p>"There is plenty of room here."</p> 
<p>Suddenly, to the astonishment of all, Keller went quickly up to the general.</p> 
<p>"Excellency," he said, impulsively, "if you want a reliable man for the night, I am ready to sacrifice myself for my friend--such a soul as he has! I have long thought him a great man, excellency! My article showed my lack of education, but when he criticizes he scatters pearls!"</p> 
<p>Ivan Fedorovitch turned from the boxer with a gesture of despair.</p> 
<p>"I shall be delighted if he will stay; it would certainly be difficult for him to get back to Petersburg," said the prince, in answer to the eager questions of Lizabetha Prokofievna.</p> 
<p>"But you are half asleep, are you not? If you don't want him, I will take him back to my house! Why, good gracious! He can hardly stand up himself! What is it? Are you ill?"</p> 
<p>Not finding the prince on his death-bed, Lizabetha Prokofievna had been misled by his appearance to think him much better than he was. But his recent illness, the painful memories attached to it, the fatigue of this evening, the incident with "Pavlicheff's son," and now this scene with Hippolyte, had all so worked on his oversensitive nature that he was now almost in a fever. Moreover, anew trouble, almost a fear, showed itself in his eyes; he watched Hippolyte anxiously as if expecting something further.</p> 
<p>Suddenly Hippolyte arose. His face, shockingly pale, was that of a man overwhelmed with shame and despair. This was shown chiefly in the look of fear and hatred which he cast upon the assembled company, and in the wild smile upon his trembling lips. Then he cast down his eyes, and with the same smile, staggered towards Burdovsky and Doktorenko, who stood at the entrance to the verandah. He had decided to go with them.</p> 
<p>"There! that is what I feared!" cried the prince. "It was inevitable!"</p> 
<p>Hippolyte turned upon him, a prey to maniacal rage, which set all the muscles of his face quivering.</p> 
<p>"Ah! that is what you feared! It was inevitable, you say! Well, let me tell you that if I hate anyone here--I hate you all," he cried, in a hoarse, strained voice-" but you, you, with your jesuitical soul, your soul of sickly sweetness, idiot, beneficent millionaire--I hate you worse than anything or anyone on earth! I saw through you and hated you long ago; from the day I first heard of you. I hated you with my whole heart. You have contrived all this! You have driven me into this state! You have made a dying man disgrace himself. You, you, you are the cause of my abject cowardice! I would kill you if I remained alive! I do not want your benefits; I will accept none from anyone; do you hear? Not from any one! I want nothing! I was delirious, do not dare to triumph! I curse every one of you, once for all!"</p> 
<p>Breath failed him here, and he was obliged to stop.</p> 
<p>"He is ashamed of his tears!" whispered Lebedeff to Lizabetha Prokofievna. "It was inevitable. Ah! what a wonderful man the prince is! He read his very soul."</p> 
<p>But Mrs. Epanchin would not deign to look at Lebedeff. Drawn up haughtily, with her head held high, she gazed at the "riff-raff," with scornful curiosity. When Hippolyte had finished, Ivan Fedorovitch shrugged his shoulders, and his wife looked him angrily up and down, as if to demand the meaning of his movement. Then she turned to the prince.</p> 
<p>"Thanks, prince, many thanks, eccentric friend of the family, for the pleasant evening you have provided for us. I am sure you are quite pleased that you have managed to mix us up with your extraordinary affairs. It is quite enough, dear family friend; thank you for giving us an opportunity of getting to know you so well."</p> 
<p>She arranged her cloak with hands that trembled with anger as she waited for the "riff-raff "to go. The cab which Lebedeff's son had gone to fetch a quarter of an hour ago, by Doktorenko's order, arrived at that moment. The general thought fit to put in a word after his wife.</p> 
<p>"Really, prince, I hardly expected after--after all our friendly intercourse-- and you see, Lizabetha Prokofievna--"</p> 
<p>"Papa, how can you?" cried Adelaida, walking quickly up to the prince and holding out her hand.</p> 
<p>He smiled absently at her; then suddenly he felt a burning sensation in his ear as an angry voice whispered:</p> 
<p>"If you do not turn those dreadful people out of the house this very instant, I shall hate you all my life--all my life!" It was Aglaya. She seemed almost in a frenzy, but she turned away before the prince could look at her. However, there was no one left to turn out of the house, for they had managed meanwhile to get Hippolyte into the cab, and it had driven off.</p> 
<p>"Well, how much longer is this going to last, Ivan Fedorovitch? What do you think? Shall I soon be delivered from these odious youths?"</p> 
<p>"My dear, I am quite ready; naturally ... the prince."</p> 
<p>Ivan Fedorovitch held out his hand to Muishkin, but ran after his wife, who was leaving with every sign of violent indignation, before he had time to shake it. Adelaida, her fiance, and Alexandra, said good-bye to their host with sincere friendliness. Evgenie Pavlovitch did the same, and he alone seemed in good spirits.</p> 
<p>"What I expected has happened! But I am sorry, you poor fellow, that you should have had to suffer for it," he murmured, with a most charming smile.</p> 
<p>Aglaya left without saying good-bye. But the evening was not to end without a last adventure. An unexpected meeting was yet in store for Lizabetha Prokofievna.</p> 
<p>She had scarcely descended the terrace steps leading to the high road that skirts the park at Pavlofsk, when suddenly there dashed by a smart open carriage, drawn by a pair of beautiful white horses. Having passed some ten yards beyond the house, the carriage suddenly drew up, and one of the two ladies seated in it turned sharp round as though she had just caught sight of some acquaintance whom she particularly wished to see.</p> 
<p>"Evgenie Pavlovitch! Is that you?" cried a clear, sweet voice, which caused the prince, and perhaps someone else, to tremble. "Well, I AM glad I've found you at last! I've sent to town for you twice today myself! My messengers have been searching for you everywhere!"</p> 
<p>Evgenie Pavlovitch stood on the steps like one struck by lightning. Mrs. Epanchin stood still too, but not with the petrified expression of Evgenie. She gazed haughtily at the audacious person who had addressed her companion, and then turned a look of astonishment upon Evgenie himself.</p> 
<p>"There's news!" continued the clear voice. "You need not be anxious about Kupferof's IOU's--Rogojin has bought them up. I persuaded him to!--I dare say we shall settle Biscup too, so it's all right, you see! Au revoir, tomorrow! And don't worry!" The carriage moved on, and disappeared.</p> 
<p>"The woman's mad!" cried Evgenie, at last, crimson with anger, and looking confusedly around. "I don't know what she's talking about! What IOU's? Who is she?" Mrs. Epanchin continued to watch his face for a couple of seconds; then she marched briskly and haughtily away towards her own house, the rest following her.</p> 
<p>A minute afterwards, Evgenie Pavlovitch reappeared on the terrace, in great agitation.</p> 
<p>"Prince," he said, "tell me the truth; do you know what all this means?"</p> 
<p>"I know nothing whatever about it!" replied the latter, who was, himself, in a state of nervous excitement.</p> 
<p>"No?"</p> 
<p>"No?</p> 
<p>"Well, nor do I!" said Evgenie Pavlovitch, laughing suddenly. "I haven't the slightest knowledge of any such IOU's as she mentioned, I swear I haven't--What's the matter, are you fainting?"</p> 
<p>"Oh, no-no-I'm all right, I assure you!"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>伊波利特在维拉·列别杰娃递给他的茶杯里润了润嘴唇，将茶杯放到小桌上，突然似乎涩促起来，几乎是困窘地环视着四周。</p> 
<p>“您瞧，叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜，这些茶杯，”他有点奇怪地急着说，“这些瓷杯，好像是精美的瓷器，总是放在列别杰夫餐具柜的玻璃门里，还上了锁；从来也不用……通常是这样，这是他妻子的陪嫁……他家这是惯例……现在他把它们拿出来给我们用，当然是表示对您的敬意，可见他多么高兴……”</p> 
<p>他还想补充说什么，但是一时没有找到话。</p> 
<p>“他到底不好意思了，我就料到是这样！”突然叶甫盖已·帕大洛维奇在公爵耳边低语说，“这可是危险的，是吧：这是极可信的一种征兆，表明他出了怨恨马上就会做出这样那样的古怪行为，叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜大概会坐不住的。”</p> 
<p>公爵疑问地瞥了他一眼。</p> 
<p>“您不怕古怪的行为。”叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇补充说，“要知道我也不怕，甚至还巴不得会有这种事；对我来说，其实就希望我们可爱的叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜受到惩罚，而且一定得在今天，马上就受惩罚，不然我就不走。您好像是在发烧。”</p> 
<p>“以后再说，您别碍事。是的，我身体不好，”公爵心不在焉、甚至不耐烦地回答着。他听到自己的名字，伊波利特在讲他。</p> 
<p>“您不相信？”伊波利特歇斯底里地笑着，“我知道就会是这样，可公爵一开始就相信了，丝毫也不惊奇。”</p> 
<p>“你听见了，公爵？”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜转向他问，“听见了？”</p> 
<p>四周的人都笑着，列别杰夫忙乱地挤到前面去，在叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜面前转来转去。</p> 
<p>“他说，这个矫揉做作的人，就是你的房东……为那个先生改过文章，就是刚才念过的针对你的文章。”</p> 
<p>公爵惊讶地扫了列别杰夫一眼。</p> 
<p>“你干吗不作声。”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶大娜甚至跺了一下脚。</p> 
<p>“那又怎么，”公爵继续打量着列别杰夫，喃喃说，“我现在才知道，他是替他们改过的。”</p> 
<p>“真的吗？”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜很快地转向列别杰夫问。</p> 
<p>“干真万确，将军夫人阁下，”列别杰夫把一只手贴在胸口，毫不犹豫地坚定答道。</p> 
<p>“简直是在夸耀！”她几乎要从椅子上跳起来。</p> 
<p>“我卑鄙，我卑鄙！”列别杰夫嘟哝着说，一边开始捶胸，一边越来越低地垂下了头。</p> 
<p>“你卑鄙与我什么相干！他以为，他说了我卑鄙，这样也就可以解脱了。公爵，我再说一次，跟这样的人结交，你不觉得羞耻吗？我永远也不会原谅你！”</p> 
<p>“公爵会原谅我的！”列别杰夫很有把握又很让人怜悯地说。</p> 
<p>“仅仅是出于义气，”凯勒尔突然跳到跟前，直接对叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜大声响亮地说，“仅仅是出于义气，夫人，我才没有出卖名声不好的朋友，我刚才隐瞒了修改文章的人，尽管正是他提出要把我从楼梯上摔下去，正如您自己听到的。为了恢复事情的真相，我承认，我确实找过他，付了６个卢布，但绝不是要他润色，说实在的，是向他这个知情人了解事实，因为大部分情况我都不知道。关于鞋罩，关于在瑞士教授那里吃饭的胃口，关于５０卢布代替２５０卢布，总之，所有这桩桩件件，这一一都是他提供的，就为了６个卢布，但是不是润色。”</p> 
<p>“我应该指出，”在越来越传播开来的笑声中，列别杰夫的一种曲意逢迎的声音迫不及待地焦躁说，“我只修改了文章的前一半，但是因为改到中间的时候我们意见不合，为了一个想法我们争吵起来，所以我就没有再改后面一半，因而那里所有文理不通的地方（那里确有文理下通的地方！），不能算丑我的头上……”</p> 
<p>“瞧他忙着干什么！”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜喊了起来。</p> 
<p>“请问，”叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇问凯勒尔，“你们什么时候改文章的？”</p> 
<p>“昨天早晨，”凯勒尔回答说，“我们见了面，双方都老实保证保守秘密。”</p> 
<p>“当时他在你面前低声下气并要你相信他的忠诚！嘿，真是些小人！我不要你的普希金文集，你女儿也不要到我这儿来了！”</p> 
<p>叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜本想站起来，但突然又气冲冲地对正在笑的伊波利特说：</p> 
<p>“亲爱的，你是想让我在这里招人笑话，是吗？”</p> 
<p>“千万别这么想，”伊波利特尴尬地微笑着说，“但最使我惊讶的是您的古怪脾气，叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜，我承认，我是故意把话引到列别杰夫身上的，我知道，怎么才会影响您，影响您一个人，因为公爵确实会原谅的，而且大概已经原谅了……甚至，可能已经在脑袋里搜寻到了原谅的话，是这样吧，公爵，对吗？”</p> 
<p>他喘着气，异常的激动随着他的每一句话而增强。</p> 
<p>“呶？……”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜对他说话的口气感到惊讶，忿忿他说，“呶？”</p> 
<p>“有关您的事我已经听了许多，都是这一类的……我非常高兴……很好地学会了尊敬您，”伊波利特继续说。</p> 
<p>他说的是一回事，可是，他用这些话想说的似乎是另一回事。他说这话时带着一种嘲笑的口气，同时又激动得不合时宜，神秘地四处打量，显然颠三倒四，每句话都语无伦次，所有这一切连同他的肺病模样和怪异的仿佛发狂一般的灼灼目光，不由得仍然吸引着人们对他的注意。</p> 
<p>“我不通世故（我承认这一点），不过，我十分惊讶的是，您不仅自己留在您认为是不体面的刚才我们那一伙入中，而且还把这些……小姐留下来听这种丑闻，虽然她们在小说里已经读到过一切。不过，我也许不了解……因为我说话离题了，但是不论怎样，除了您，谁会因为一个孩子的请求（是啊，是个孩子，我再次承认）而留下来……与他一起度过一个晚上并参与……一切……而且……第二天就感到羞耻……（不过，我承认，我要说的不是这样），我对所有这一切异常赞赏和深表敬意，虽然光凭您丈夫阁下的脸色就已经可以看出，这一切对他来说是多么不愉快……嘻嘻！”他哧哧笑了起来，完全语无伦次，突然又咳嗽起来，有两分钟无法继续说话。</p> 
<p>“甚至都喘不上气来！”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜冷漠而尖刻地说，一边用严峻和好奇的目光打量着他，“算了，亲爱的孩子，你说够了。该走啦。”</p> 
<p>“请允许我，先生，向您指出，”突然伊万·费奥多罗维奇忍无可忍，怒冲冲地说道，“我妻子在我们的共同朋友和邻居列夫·尼古拉耶维奇这里，无论如何，年轻人，用不到您来评判叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜的行为，同样也不用您当着我的面大声地议论我的脸色表明什么。确实这样。如果我的妻子留在这里，”他继续说，随着每一句话火气也越来越大，“那不如说是出于惊讶和大家都能理解的当今的好奇心，想看看怪诞的年轻人。我自己也留下了，就像有时看见什么东西，有什么东西可以看就在街上停下来一样，比如……比如……比如……”</p> 
<p>“比如看稀罕东西，”叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇提示说。</p> 
<p>“好极了，对极了，”想不出比喻而卡住说不下去的将军阁下高兴地说“正是如看稀罕东西一样。但不论怎样，最使我惊讶、甚至痛心的是，如果译法上可以这样表达的话，您，年轻人，竟然不会理解，叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜现在留下来跟您在一起，是因为您有病，既然您真的生命垂危，这么说吧，她是出于怜悯，是因为您说的那些可怜话，先生，因此任何污言脏语无论如何都不会砧污她的名声，品质和身份……叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜！”满脸通红的将军结束说，“如果想走，那么就跟我们善良的公爵告别。”</p> 
<p>“谢谢您的教诲，将军，”伊波利特若有所思地望着他，严肃和出人意料地打断说。</p> 
<p>“我们走吧，妈妈，还要呆多久！……”阿格拉娅从椅子上站起来，不耐烦和气忿地说。</p> 
<p>“再等两分钟，亲爱的伊万·费奥多罗维奇，如果你允许的话，”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜尊严地转向自己的丈夫说，“我觉得，他浑身在发烧，尽说胡话；我根据他的眼神深信这一点；不能这样撇下他。列夫·尼古拉耳维奇！今天不送他去彼得堡，可以让他住您这儿吗？ｃｈｅｒ ｐｒｉｎｃｅ＊，您觉得无聊吗？”不知什么缘故她突然问ω公爵，“到这儿来，亚历山德拉，把头发整理一下，我的孩子。”</p> 
<p>她为亚历山德拉整理了一下没什么必要整理的头发，吻了她；叫她就是为了这点。</p> 
<p>“我认为您在精神上是能发展的……”伊波利特从沉思状态中醒悟过来。又说起来，“对！我想要说什么，”他仿佛突然回忆起什么，兴奋地说，“布尔多夫斯基真心想维护自己的母亲，不对吗？结果他却使她蒙受了耻辱。公爵想要帮助布尔多夫斯基，出于一颗纯洁的心向他提供温柔的友情和金钱，大概，他是你们所有的人中唯一没有厌弃布尔多夫斯基的人，可是他们俩都像真正的敌人一样彼此势不两立……哈一哈一哈！你们全都敌视布尔多夫斯基，就因为在你们看来对待自己的母亲不体面，不优雅，是这样吗？是这样吗？是这样吗？因为所有你们这些人都十分喜爱形式的优美和高雅，只赞成这点，不对吗？（我早就料想，你们就只要这点！）好吧，那么你们要知道，你们中也许没有一个人像布尔多夫斯基那样爱他的母亲！公爵，我知道，您通过加涅奇卡暗中寄钱给布尔多夫斯基的母亲，我敢打赌（嘻一嘻一嘻！他歇斯底里地笑着），我敢打赌，布尔多夫斯基现在都要指责您采取的形式不得体和不尊敬他的母亲，真的是这样，哈一哈一哈！”</p> 
<p>这时他又喘不过气来，咳起嗽来。</p> 
<p>“怎么，完了！现在全说出来了，说完了？好了，现在去睡觉吗，你有烧，”叶莉扎维塔·普罗利菲耶夫娜一直不安地望着他，这时便迫不及待地打断说，“啊，天哪！他还在说！”</p> 
<p>“您好像在笑吧？您干嘛老是笑话我？我发觉，您一直在嘲笑我，”突然他惴惴不安和气冲冲地对叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇说，而他确实是在笑。</p> 
<p>“我只是想问您，先生……伊波利特……对不起，我忘了您的姓了。”</p> 
<p>“捷连季耶夫先生，”公爵说。</p> 
<p>“对了，是捷连季耶夫，公爵，谢谢您，您刚才说过了，可我却忘得一干二净……我想问您，捷连季耶夫先生，我听说，您认为，您只要从窗口向老百姓讲上一刻钟话，他们马上就会同意您的一切主张，而且立即跟在您后面，这是真的吗？”</p> 
<p>＊法语：亲爱的公爵。</p> 
<p>“非常可能，我是说过的……”伊波利特仿佛想起了什么，回答说。“肯定说过的。”他突然又补了一句，又活跃起来，坚定地望了一眼叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇，“那又怎么样？”</p> 
<p>“完全没什么：我只是想知道一下，补充一下情况。”叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇不再说了，但伊波利特仍然望着他，不耐烦地等着他继续说。</p> 
<p>“怎么样，说完了，是吗？”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜问叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇，“快点说完吧，老兄，他该去睡了。是不是不会结束？（她恼火得不得了。）”</p> 
<p>“也许，我很不反对补充几句，”叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇微笑着继续说，我从您的同伙那里听到的一切，捷连季耶夫先生，还有刚才您以不容置疑的阐明的一切，据我看，可以归结为权利至上论，首先是权利，不顾一切，乃至排除一切，甚至可能在研究权利是什么之前就要求权利。也许我说得不对。”</p> 
<p>“当然您锗了，我甚至不明白您说的……接下去呢？”在露台角落里也响起了絮语声。列别杰夫的外甥低声咕哝着什么。</p> 
<p>“接下去几乎没有什么了，”叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇继续说，“我只想指出，从此出发事情可能会直接转到强权论上面去，也就是个人的拳头和个人的欲望的权利，其实，世界上很多事情就常常是这样告终的。普鲁东就是主张强权的。美国南北战争中许多最进步的自由主义者宣布自己拥护种植场主，业主认为，黑奴总是黑奴，是比白种人低等的种族，因此强权应属白人……”</p> 
<p>“怎么呢？”</p> 
<p>“也就是说，看来，您并不否认强权？”</p> 
<p>“下面怎么说？”</p> 
<p>“您真是个打碗沙锅问到底的人；我只想指出，从强权到老虎和鳄鱼的权利，甚至于到达尼洛夫和戈尔斯基是不很远了。”</p> 
<p>“我不知道，再下去呢？”</p> 
<p>伊波利特勉强听叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇说话。虽然他对他不时说“怎么样，“接着说”，看来，这主要是交谈中养成的老习惯，而并非是对谈话表示关注和好奇。</p> 
<p>“下面没什么要说了……完了。”</p> 
<p>“不过，我并不生您气，”突然伊波利特完全出人意料地收尾说。他未必完全自觉地递过手去，甚至还带着微笑。叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇起先感到惊讶，但马上就以最认真的样子碰了碰伸给他的手，就像接受对方的宽恕那样。</p> 
<p>“我不能不补充，”他还是用那种又恭敬又不恭敬的语气说，“说一声向您表示感谢，感谢您对我的关注。允许我说话，因为，据我的许多观察来看，我们的自由主义者从来也不允许有自己的独特的信念，只要一听到有反对意见，马上就回之以辱骂或者甚至于更糟……”</p> 
<p>“您说的这点十分正确，”伊万·费奥多罗维奇指出。他双手抄在背后，显示出极为无聊的的样子从露台退向出口，在那里烦恼地打了个呵欠。</p> 
<p>“好了，你够了，兄弟，”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜突然对叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇宣告说，“您都让我厌烦了……”</p> 
<p>“该走了，”突然伊波利特忧心忡忡、几乎是惊惧地站了起来，局促不安地望着周围的人。“我耽搁了你们；我想把所有的话都对你们说……我想，最后一次了……所有的话……这是空想……”</p> 
<p>看得出，他精神振奋是一阵一阵的，从那几乎是真正梦吃般的状态中突然解脱出来，仅仅一会儿，他是完全清醒地，一下子想起来什么就说起话来，多半是些片断，也许，这是病中躺在床上，在长久的寂寞中，在孤独和失眠则早已反复想过和记熟了的内容。</p> 
<p>“好了，别了！”他突然断然说，“你们以为，我对你们说一声‘别了’容易吗？哈一哈！”他自己对所提出的尴尬的问题感到懊恼而讪笑着，突然，仿佛对老是辞不达意感到恼火，他大声和气乎乎地说，“阁下！我荣幸地请您参加我的葬礼，如果您肯赏光的话，还有……请诸位也随将军前往！……”</p> 
<p>他又笑了起来；但这已经是发狂的笑声。叶莉维塔·普罗科菲耶夫则惊恐地走到他跟前，抓住他的一只手。他凝神望着她，还是那样笑着，但是笑声没有继续下去，仿佛在他脸上停住了，凝固了。</p> 
<p>“您知道吗，我到这儿来是为了看看树木？就是这些……（他指着花园垦的树木）这不可笑吗，啊？可是这事一点也不可笑，是吧？”他一本正经地朝叶莉维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜，突然又沉思起来；接着，过了一会儿，他抬起头，好奇地用目光在人群中搜寻着。他找叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇，后者正站在右边不远的地方，就在原来的地方，但他已经忘了，所以在周围寻找。“啊，您没有走！”他终于找到了他，“您刚才始终在笑话我想从窗口对老百姓讲一刻钟……您知道，我不是１８岁：我枕着忱头躺了这么多年，朝这窗口望了这么多年，各种各样的事情……想来想去……这么多年……死人是没有年龄的，您也知道。我还是在上星期才想到这一点，那天夜里我醒了……知道吗，您最怕什么？您最怕我们的真诚，尽管您蔑视我们！这一点我也是在那天半夜里躺在枕头上时想到的……您以为，我刚才想嘲笑您吗，叶莉扎塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜？不，我不是笑您，我只想称赞……科利亚说，公爵，您是个孩子……这很好……对了，我究竟……还想说什么……”</p> 
<p>他双手捂住脸，沉思起来。</p> 
<p>“瞧我想到什么了：刚才您告别的时候，我突然想，就这些人，今后会再也见不到他们了，永远见不到了！连树木也见下到了，剩下的将只是一垛红色的砖墙，梅耶尔的房子……就在我窗口对面……好吧，就把这一切讲给这些人听吧……你倒试试讲讲看；这位是美人……可是你却是个死人，就自己介绍是死人，说，‘死者什么都可以说’……玛里娅·阿列克谢夫娜*公爵夫人不会骂的，哈一哈！你们不笑？”他不相信地扫视着周围的人。“知道吗，躺在忱头上我想到过许多念头……要知道，我深信大自然是很会嘲弄人的……，您刚才说，我是个无神论者，要知道，这个大自然……你们为什么又笑了？你们太残酷了！”他打量着大家，突然忧郁而愤然地说，“我没有腐蚀科利亚，”他用的完全是另外一种语气，仿佛也是猛然想起似的，严肃而坚定地结束道：</p> 
<p>“这里无论哪一个都没有笑你，没有，你放心！”叶莉扎维塔，普罗科菲耶夫娜几于是受着折磨，“明天会有新的大夫来；原来那个看错了病；坐下吧，别站着！你在说胡话……哎，现在拿他怎么办！”她张罗着让他坐到扶手椅里她的脸颊上闪烁着泪花。</p> 
<p>伊波利特几乎是惊讶得愣住了，他抬起手，胆怯地伸过去，触及了那颗泪花，他像孩子般的嫣然一笑。</p> 
<p>“我……您……”他高兴地说了起来，“您不知道，我……您……他总是异常欢欣地向我谈起您，就是他，科利亚……我喜欢他那种欢欣的样子。我没有腐蚀他！我只是使他没有变样……我想使大家都不变样，使大家，可是他们中没有这样的人，一个都没有……我想当个活动家，我有这个权利……。啊，我想做的事情大多了！我现在却什么也不想做，什么也不想做，我向自己发誓什么也不想做；就让人家去寻求真理吧，让他们没有我吧！是啊，大自然是嘲弄人的！为什么它，”他突然又激动起来说，“为什么它创造了最优秀的人，又为了以后嘲笑他们？它创造成这样，使其成为世界上公认的唯一完善的生物……它创造成这样，把它展示给人们看，又规定他说出，为什么要流这么多鲜血，如果一下子都流光，那么人们必会呛死！啊，我就要死了，这多好！也许，我也会说出什么可怕的谎言来，大自然是会这样作弄人的！……我没有腐蚀任何人……我想为所有的人的幸福，对发现和传播真理而活：……我望着窗外梅那尔房子的墙并想就讲一刻钟，并且要使大家，使大家信服，虽然没有遇上人们，可一生中就这么一次遇上了……你们！有什么结果呢？没什么！结果是，你们蔑视我！因此我就是个不需要的人，因此我是傻瓜，因此我就到时候了！我不会留下任何回忆！没有声音，没有痕迹，有一件事业，也没有传播过任何信仰！……别嘲笑一个愚昧的人！忘掉吧！忘掉一切……请忘掉，别这样残酷！您知道吗，要不是染上这肺病，我也会自己杀了自己……”</p> 
<p>*《聪明误》一剧里有一句台词：“玛里娅·阿列克谢耶夫娜会怎么说。”后来这句话常用来代替人“人家会怎么说呢？”</p> 
<p>他似乎还有许多话想说，但没有说完，倒在扶手倚里，手捂着脸，像孩子似的哭了起来。</p> 
<p>“嘿，现在可拿他怎么办？”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜高喊了一声，到他跟前，捧住他的头，把它紧紧地搂在自己胸前。他一抽一抽地哭着，“好了，好了！好了，别哭了，好了，够了，你是个善良的孩子，上帝原谅你的无知的；好了，够了，坚强些……再说，过后你会觉得不好意思的……”</p> 
<p>“我家里，”伊波利特用力抬起头来，说，“我家里有弟弟和妹妹们，都很小，很可怜，天真无邪……她会把他们教坏的！您是个圣徒，您……自己是个孩于，救救他们吧！把他们从这个女人手里夺过来……她……羞耻，哦，帮帮他们吧，帮帮吧，上帝会为此给您百倍的奖赏，看在上帝份上，在基督份上“……”</p> 
<p>“您倒是说呀，伊万·费奥多罗维奇，现在怎么办。”叶莉扎维塔·普科菲耶夫娜气乎乎地说，“您就费费心，打破您那架子十足的沉默吧！如果不拿主意，那么您就得知道，我就亲自留在这儿过夜，在您的专制下您把我虐待得够了！”</p> 
<p>叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜激烈而又气愤地问，并等看迅速回答。是在类似的场合下大部分在场的人（甚至有许多人）都是以沉默不语、消极观望作答，他们丝毫不想把事情搅到自己身上，往往事后很久才表露自己想法。在在场的人中这里也有这样的人，他们准备在这里哪怕坐到第二天早晨，也不愿意落出一句话来，比如瓦尔瓦拉·阿尔达利翁诺夫娜，整个晚上她就坐在离人家稍远些的地方，不吭一声，始终怀着不同寻常的好奇心听人家讲话，这样做也许有她自己的原因。</p> 
<p>“我的意见，亲爱的，”将军开口说，“现在这里需要的，这么说吧，是位护士，而不是我们的激动不安，大概，还需要有一位可靠的、头脑清醒的人陪夜。不论怎样，应该间一下公爵……并马上让病人休息。明天还可以再表示关心。”</p> 
<p>“现在１２点，我们要走了。他跟我们一起走还是留在您这儿？”多克托连科气冲冲地问公爵。</p> 
<p>“如果你们愿意的话，就留下来，你们可以陪他，”公爵说，“这儿有地方。”</p> 
<p>“阁下，”凯勒尔先生出入意料和兴高采烈地跳到将军跟前说，“如果要求一个可以让人满意的人陪夜，我准备为了朋友作出牺牲……这是个多好的人啊！我早就已经认为他是个伟大的人，将军阁下！当然，我才疏学浅，但是，如果他批评起来，那可真是字字珠矶，字字珠玑呀，将军阁下！……”</p> 
<p>将军绝望地转过身去。</p> 
<p>“如果他留下来，我很高兴，赶路的话，当然他是困难的，”公爵对叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜气乎乎的问题作出表示。</p> 
<p>“你睡着了怎么的？如果你不愿意，爵爷，我就把他带到自己家里！天哪！他自己也勉强站得住！你病了还是怎么啦？”</p> 
<p>刚才叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜发现公爵并不是躺在床上奄奄一息，仅凭外表确实大大夸大了他那过得去的幢康状况。但是，不久的疾病、伴随它而来的痛苦的回忆，这个晚上忙忙碌碌造成的疲劳、“帕夫利谢夫儿子”事件、现在又是伊波利特事件——这一切刺激了公爵的疾病的感受力，确实使他达到了激狂的状态。但是，除此而外，在他的眼神中现在还有另一种操心，甚至害怕；他担心地望着伊波利特，仿佛等待着他还会弄出什么名堂来。</p> 
<p>突然伊波利特站了起来，脸色苍白得吓人，变了样的脸上露出可怕的、绝望的羞愧，这尤其表现在他那敌视和恐惧地望着众人的目光中，表现在抽搐的唇间那茫然、扭曲、蠕动的苦笑中。他立即垂下眼，跌跌冲冲踉跄着，一直这样苦笑着，朝站在露台出口的布尔多大斯基和多克托边科走去，他要跟他们离去。</p> 
<p>“哎，我害怕的正是这一点！”公爵高呼着，“事情就会是这样！”</p> 
<p>伊波利特满怀着疯狂的仇恨很快地转向他，脸上的每一根线条似乎都在颤动和说话。</p> 
<p>“啊，原来您怕的是这一点！照您看来，‘事情就会是这样？’那么您要知道，如果我仇恨这里的什么人，”他吼着，声嘶力竭，尖声尖气，唾沫飞溅，“我恨你们所有的人，所有的人！，但是您，您这个虚情假意、甜言蜜语的小人，白痴，百万富翁的慈善家，我更恨您，比世上所有的人和所有的一切都更可恨！我早就了解您和恨您了，当我还只是听说您的时候，我就怀着心中的全部仇恨来恨您了……现在这一切全是您造成的！这是您逼得我发火的！您把一个垂死的人羞得无地自容，我表现出卑鄙的怯懦是您的过错。是您！如果我能活下去，我会杀死您！我不需要您的慈善，也不接受任何人的善行，听到了吧，我不要任何人的任何恩赐！我是在说胡话，不许你们洋洋得意！……我永远诅咒你们大家！”</p> 
<p>此时他完全喘不过气来了。</p> 
<p>“他为自己流泪感到难为情了！”列别杰夫向叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜低语着，“‘事情就会是这样！’公爵说得真对！他看透了……”</p> 
<p>可是叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜连瞧都没有瞧他一眼，她昂首挺胸高傲地站着，好奇而轻蔑地打量着“这些小人”。伊波利特说完的时候，将军曾耸了下肩膀；她愤怒地从头到脚端详着他，似乎是在询问他的动作有什么意思，但马上她又转向了公爵。</p> 
<p>“谢谢您，公爵，我们家的怪朋友，谢谢您使我们大家过了一个愉快的晚上。现在想必您心里很高兴，因为您把我们也扯进您的这场闹剧中去了……够了，我家亲爱的朋友，谢谢，至少您让我们终于把您好好看清楚了！”</p> 
<p>她气忿地整理起自己的披肩来，等待着“那一伙人”动身。这时一辆轻便马车驶近了“那一伙人”，那是一刻钟前多克托连科吩咐列别杰夫的中学生儿子去叫来的。将军马上跟在自己妻子后面插话说：</p> 
<p>“确实，公爵，我甚至没有料到……在过去那一切之后，在种种友好的交往之后……最终，叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜会……”</p> 
<p>“怎么能这样，怎么可以这样！”阿杰莱达快步走到公爵跟前，向他伸出手，感叹地说。</p> 
<p>公爵茫然地朝她笑了一下。突然一一阵热烈而迅速的低语简直像烧的了他的耳朵。</p> 
<p>“如果您不马上甩掉这些卑鄙可恶的入，我会一辈子，一辈子恨您一个人的！”阿格拉娅低声说。她仿佛狂怒至极，但是还没来得及看她一眼，她已经转过身去了，其实，他已经没有什么也没有人可以甩掉了：当时他们已经把病着的伊波利特好歹安顿到马车上，马车接着就驶离了。</p> 
<p>“怎么，伊万·费奥多罗维奇，这还要继续多久？您怎么看？我还要忍受这些可恶的小子要多久？”</p> 
<p>“是啊，亲爱的……我当然愿意……还有公爵……”</p> 
<p>然而伊万·费奥多罗维奇还是向公爵递过手去，但没来得及握手，就跟在愤愤然噎噎响地从露台上走下去的叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜后面跑了。阿杰莱达，她的未婚夫和亚历山德拉诚挚亲切地跟公爵告别。叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇也是这样，只有他一个人是快活的。</p> 
<p>“果然如我所料！只不过遗憾的是，您这个可怜人这下可受苦了，”他带着最可爱的笑容低声说着。</p> 
<p>阿格拉娅是不辞而别。</p> 
<p>但是这天晚上的奇遇至此还没有结束；叶莉扎维塔·普罗种菲耶夫娜还必须得承受一次相当意外的路遇。</p> 
<p>她还没有来得及从台阶上走到环绕公园的路上，突然一辆套着两匹白马的流光溢彩的轻便马车从公爵别墅旁奔驰而过。马车里坐着两位雍容华贵的妇人。但是马车驰过不到十步远又突然停住了；其中一位女士很快地回过头来仿佛突然发现了她所必须要找的某个熟人。</p> 
<p>“叶甫盖尼·帕夫雷奇！这是你吗？”一个清脆悦耳的声音突然喊了一声，这声音使公爵，也许还使什么人颤粟了一下。“哦，我真高兴，终于找到了！我派人去城里送信，派了两个！找了您一整天！”</p> 
<p>叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇站在台阶上像是被雷声惊呆了似的。叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜也站在原地不动，但不像叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇那样吓得木呆呆的。她用五分钟前看那些“小人”那样的高傲和冷若冰霜的鄙视目光瞥了一眼这个毫无顾忌的女士，立即又把目光移到叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇身上。</p> 
<p>“有个消息！”那清亮的噪音又继续说，“你不用为库普费尔手中的借据担心；罗戈任用三万卢布买了下来，是我劝他买的，你还可以哪怕安心三个月。至于跟比斯库普及那一伙坏蛋想必是能讲妥的，因为是熟人嘛！好了，就这么回事，也就是说，一切顺利。你就开心吧！明天见！”</p> 
<p>马车起动，很快就消失了。</p> 
<p>“这个疯女人！”叶甫盖尼&amp;mid</p>
