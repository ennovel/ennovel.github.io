<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth upon them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now on the twenty-fourth day of this month the children of Israel came together, taking no food and putting haircloth and dust on their bodies.
<br>9:2&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;以 色 列 人 （ 人 原 文 作 种 类 ） 就 与 一 切 外 邦 人 离 绝 ， 站 着 承 认 自 己 的 罪 恶 和 列 祖 的 罪 孽 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And the seed of Israel made themselves separate from all the men of other nations, publicly requesting forgiveness for their sins and the wrongdoing of their fathers.
<br>9:3&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;那 日 的 四 分 之 一 ， 站 在 自 己 的 地 方 ， 念 耶 和 华 他 们 神 的 律 法 书 ， 又 四 分 之 一 认 罪 ， 敬 拜 耶 和 华 他 们 的 神 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD their God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And for a fourth part of the day, upright in their places, they were reading from the book of the law of their God; and for a fourth part of the day they were requesting forgiveness and worshipping the Lord their God.
<br>9:4&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;耶 书 亚 ， 巴 尼 ， 甲 篾 ， 示 巴 尼 ， 布 尼 ， 示 利 比 ， 巴 尼 ， 基 拿 尼 站 在 利 未 人 的 台 上 ， 大 声 哀 求 耶 和 华 他 们 的 神 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani took their places on the steps of the Levites, crying in a loud voice to the Lord their God.
<br>9:5&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;利 未 人 耶 书 亚 ， 甲 篾 ， 巴 尼 ， 哈 沙 尼 ， 示 利 比 ， 荷 第 雅 ， 示 巴 尼 ， 毗 他 希 雅 说 ， 你 们 要 站 起 来 称 颂 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 ， 永 世 无 尽 。 耶 和 华 阿 ， 你 荣 耀 之 名 是 应 当 称 颂 的 。 超 乎 一 切 称 颂 和 赞 美 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said, Get up and give praise to the Lord your God for ever and ever. Praise be to your great name which is lifted up high over all blessing and praise.
<br>9:6&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 ， 惟 独 你 是 耶 和 华 。 你 造 了 天 和 天 上 的 天 ， 并 天 上 的 万 象 ， 地 和 地 上 的 万 物 ， 海 和 海 中 所 有 的 。 这 一 切 都 是 你 所 保 存 的 。 天 军 也 都 敬 拜 你 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;You are the Lord, even you only; you have made heaven, the heaven of heavens with all their armies, the earth and all things in it, the seas and everything in them; and you keep them from destruction: and the armies of heaven are your worshippers.
<br>9:7&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 是 耶 和 华 神 ， 曾 拣 选 亚 伯 兰 ， 领 他 出 迦 勒 底 的 吾 珥 ， 给 他 改 名 叫 亚 伯 拉 罕 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;You are the Lord, the God, who took Abram and made him yours, guiding him from Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him the name of Abraham;
<br>9:8&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 见 他 在 你 面 前 心 里 诚 实 ， 就 与 他 立 约 。 应 许 把 迦 南 人 ， 赫 人 ， 亚 摩 利 人 ， 比 利 洗 人 ， 耶 布 斯 人 ， 革 迦 撒 人 之 地 赐 给 他 的 后 裔 。 且 应 验 了 你 的 话 ， 因 为 你 是 公 义 的 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;You saw that his heart was true to you, and made an agreement with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Jebusite and the Girgashite, even to give it to his seed, and you have done what you said; for righteousness is yours:
<br>9:9&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 曾 看 见 我 们 列 祖 在 埃 及 所 受 的 困 苦 ， 垂 听 他 们 在 红 海 边 的 哀 求 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And you saw the trouble of our fathers in Egypt, and their cry came to your ears by the Red Sea;
<br>9:10&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;就 施 行 神 迹 奇 事 在 法 老 ， 和 他 一 切 臣 仆 ， 并 他 国 中 的 众 民 身 上 。 你 也 得 了 名 声 ， 正 如 今 日 一 样 ， 因 为 你 知 道 他 们 向 我 们 列 祖 行 事 狂 傲 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this day.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And you did signs and wonders on Pharaoh and all his servants and all the people of his land; for you saw how cruel they were to them. So you got yourself a name as it is today.
<br>9:11&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 又 在 我 们 列 祖 面 前 把 海 分 开 ， 使 他 们 在 海 中 行 走 干 地 ， 将 追 赶 他 们 的 人 抛 在 深 海 ， 如 石 头 抛 在 大 水 中 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;By you the sea was parted before them, so that they went through the sea on dry land; and those who went after them went down into the deep, like a stone into great waters.
<br>9:12&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;并 且 白 昼 用 云 柱 引 导 他 们 ， 黑 夜 用 火 柱 照 亮 他 们 当 行 的 路 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And you went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light on the way they were to go.
<br>9:13&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 也 降 临 在 西 乃 山 ， 从 天 上 与 他 们 说 话 ， 赐 给 他 们 正 直 的 典 章 ， 真 实 的 律 法 ， 美 好 的 条 例 与 诫 命 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good statutes and commandments:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And you came down on Mount Sinai, and your voice came to them from heaven, giving them right decisions and true laws, good rules and orders:
<br>9:14&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 使 他 们 知 道 你 的 安 息 圣 日 ， 并 借 你 仆 人 摩 西 传 给 他 们 诫 命 ， 条 例 ， 律 法 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy servant:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And you gave them word of your holy Sabbath, and gave them orders and rules and a law, by the hand of Moses your servant:
<br>9:15&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;从 天 上 赐 下 粮 食 充 他 们 的 饥 ， 从 磐 石 使 水 流 出 解 他 们 的 渴 ， 又 吩 咐 他 们 进 去 得 你 起 誓 应 许 赐 给 他 们 的 地 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And you gave them bread from heaven when they were in need, and made water come out of the rock for their drink, and gave them orders to go in and take for their heritage the land which your hand had been lifted up to give them.
<br>9:16&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 我 们 的 列 祖 行 事 狂 傲 ， 硬 着 颈 项 不 听 从 你 的 诫 命 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But they and our fathers, in their pride, made their necks stiff, and gave no attention to your orders,
<br>9:17&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;不 肯 顺 从 ， 也 不 记 念 你 在 他 们 中 间 所 行 的 奇 事 ， 竟 硬 着 颈 项 ， 居 心 背 逆 ， 自 立 首 领 ， 要 回 他 们 为 奴 之 地 。 但 你 是 乐 意 饶 恕 人 ， 有 恩 典 ， 有 怜 悯 ， 不 轻 易 发 怒 ， 有 丰 盛 慈 爱 的 神 ， 并 不 丢 弃 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And would not do them, and gave no thought to the wonders you had done among them; but made their necks stiff, and turning away from you, made a captain over themselves to take them back to their prison in Egypt: but you are a God of forgiveness, full of grace and pity, slow to wrath and great in mercy, and you did not give them up.
<br>9:18&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 虽 然 铸 了 一 只 牛 犊 ， 彼 此 说 ， 这 是 领 你 出 埃 及 的 神 。 因 而 大 大 惹 动 你 的 怒 气 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Even when they had made for themselves an ox of metal, and said, This is your God who took you up out of Egypt, and had done so much to make you angry;
<br>9:19&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 还 是 大 施 怜 悯 ， 在 旷 野 不 丢 弃 他 们 。 白 昼 ， 云 柱 不 离 开 他 们 ， 仍 引 导 他 们 行 路 。 黑 夜 ， 火 柱 也 不 离 开 他 们 ， 仍 照 亮 他 们 当 行 的 路 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Even then, in your great mercy, you did not give them up in the waste land: the pillar of cloud still went before them by day, guiding them on their way, and the pillar of fire by night, to give them light, and make clear the way they were to go.
<br>9:20&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 也 赐 下 你 良 善 的 灵 教 训 他 们 ， 未 尝 不 赐 吗 哪 使 他 们 糊 口 ， 并 赐 水 解 他 们 的 渴 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And you gave your good spirit to be their teacher, and did not keep back your manna from their mouths, and gave them water when they had need of it.
<br>9:21&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 旷 野 四 十 年 ， 你 养 育 他 们 ， 他 们 就 一 无 所 缺 。 衣 服 没 有 穿 破 ， 脚 也 没 有 肿 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Truly, for forty years you were their support in the waste land, and they were in need of nothing; their clothing did not get old or their feet become tired.
<br>9:22&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;并 且 你 将 列 国 之 地 照 分 赐 给 他 们 ， 他 们 就 得 了 西 宏 之 地 ， 希 实 本 王 之 地 ， 和 巴 珊 王 噩 之 地 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And you gave them kingdoms and peoples, making distribution to them in every part of the land: so they took for their heritage the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og, king of Bashan.
<br>9:23&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;你 也 使 他 们 的 子 孙 多 如 天 上 的 星 ， 带 他 们 到 你 所 应 许 他 们 列 祖 进 入 得 为 业 之 地 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And you made their children as great in number as the stars of heaven, and took them into the land, of which you had said to their fathers that they were to go in and take it for themselves.
<br>9:24&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 样 ， 他 们 进 去 得 了 那 地 ， 你 在 他 们 面 前 制 伏 那 地 的 居 民 ， 就 是 迦 南 人 。 将 迦 南 人 和 其 君 王 ， 并 那 地 的 居 民 ， 都 交 在 他 们 手 里 ， 让 他 们 任 意 而 待 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;So the children went in and took the land, and you overcame before them the people of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them up into their hands, with their kings and the people of the land, so that they might do with them whatever it was their pleasure to do.
<br>9:25&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 得 了 坚 固 的 城 邑 ， 肥 美 的 地 土 ， 充 满 各 样 美 物 的 房 屋 ， 凿 成 的 水 井 ， 葡 萄 园 ， 橄 榄 园 ， 并 许 多 果 木 树 。 他 们 就 吃 而 得 饱 ， 身 体 肥 胖 ， 因 你 的 大 恩 ， 心 中 快 乐 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And they took walled towns and a fat land, and became the owners of houses full of all good things, water-holes cut in the rock, vine-gardens and olive-gardens and a wealth of fruit-trees: so they had food enough and became fat, and had joy in the good you gave them.
<br>9:26&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;然 而 ， 他 们 不 顺 从 ， 竟 背 叛 你 ， 将 你 的 律 法 丢 在 背 后 ， 杀 害 那 劝 他 们 归 向 你 的 众 先 知 ， 大 大 惹 动 你 的 怒 气 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great provocations.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But they were hard-hearted, and went against your authority, turning their backs on your law, and putting to death your prophets, who gave witness against them with the purpose of turning them back again to you, and they did much to make you angry.
<br>9:27&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;所 以 你 将 他 们 交 在 敌 人 的 手 中 ， 磨 难 他 们 。 他 们 遭 难 的 时 候 哀 求 你 ， 你 就 从 天 上 垂 听 ， 照 你 的 大 怜 悯 赐 给 他 们 拯 救 者 ， 救 他 们 脱 离 敌 人 的 手 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And so you gave them up into the hands of their haters who were cruel to them: and in the time of their trouble, when they made their prayer to you, you gave ear to them from heaven; and in your great mercy gave them saviours, who made them free from the hands of their haters.
<br>9:28&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 他 们 得 平 安 之 后 ， 又 在 你 面 前 行 恶 ， 所 以 你 丢 弃 他 们 在 仇 敌 的 手 中 ， 使 仇 敌 辖 制 他 们 。 然 而 他 们 转 回 哀 求 你 ， 你 仍 从 天 上 垂 听 ， 屡 次 照 你 的 怜 悯 拯 救 他 们 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee: therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But when they had rest, they did evil again before you: so you gave them into the hands of their haters, who had rule over them: but when they came back and made their prayer to you, you gave ear to them from heaven; again and again, in your mercy, you gave them salvation;
<br>9:29&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;又 警 戒 他 们 ， 要 使 他 们 归 服 你 的 律 法 。 他 们 却 行 事 狂 傲 ， 不 听 从 你 的 诫 命 ， 干 犯 你 的 典 章 （ 人 若 遵 行 就 必 因 此 活 着 ） ， 扭 转 肩 头 ， 硬 着 颈 项 ， 不 肯 听 从 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And gave witness against them so that you might make them come back again to your law: but their hearts were lifted up, and they gave no attention to your orders and went against your decisions (which, if a man keeps them, will be life to him), and turning their backs on you, made their necks stiff and did not give ear.
<br>9:30&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;但 你 多 年 宽 容 他 们 ， 又 用 你 的 灵 借 众 先 知 劝 戒 他 们 ， 他 们 仍 不 听 从 ， 所 以 你 将 他 们 交 在 列 国 之 民 的 手 中 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Year after year you put up with them, and gave witness against them by your spirit through your prophets: still they did not give ear: and so you gave them up into the hands of the peoples of the lands.
<br>9:31&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;然 而 你 大 发 怜 悯 ， 不 全 然 灭 绝 他 们 ， 也 不 丢 弃 他 们 。 因 为 你 是 有 恩 典 ， 有 怜 悯 的 神 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Even then, in your great mercy, you did not put an end to them completely, or give them up; for you are a God of grace and mercy.
<br>9:32&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 们 的 神 阿 ， 你 是 至 大 ， 至 能 ， 至 可 畏 ， 守 约 施 慈 爱 的 神 。 我 们 的 君 王 ， 首 领 ， 祭 司 ， 先 知 ， 列 祖 ， 和 你 的 众 民 。 从 亚 述 列 王 的 时 候 直 到 今 日 所 遭 遇 的 苦 难 ， 现 在 求 你 不 要 以 为 小 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And now, our God, the great, the strong, the God who is to be feared, who keeps faith and mercy, let not all this trouble seem small to you, which has come on us, and on our kings and our rulers and on our priests and our prophets and our fathers and on all your people from the time of the kings of Assyria till this day.
<br>9:33&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;在 一 切 临 到 我 们 的 事 上 ， 你 却 是 公 义 的 。 因 你 所 行 的 是 诚 实 ， 我 们 所 做 的 是 邪 恶 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;But still, you have been in the right in everything which has come on us; you have been true to us, but we have done evil:
<br>9:34&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 们 的 君 王 ， 首 领 ， 祭 司 ， 列 祖 都 不 遵 守 你 的 律 法 。 不 听 从 你 的 诫 命 和 你 警 戒 他 们 的 话 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And our kings, our rulers, our priests, and our fathers have not kept your law or given attention to your orders and your witness, with which you gave witness against them.
<br>9:35&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;他 们 在 本 国 里 沾 你 大 恩 的 时 候 ， 在 你 所 赐 给 他 们 这 广 大 肥 美 之 地 上 不 事 奉 你 ， 也 不 转 离 他 们 的 恶 行 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;For they have not been your servants in their kingdom, and in all the good things you gave them, and in the great and fat land you gave them, and they have not been turned away from their evil-doing.
<br>9:36&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;我 们 现 今 作 了 奴 仆 。 至 于 你 所 赐 给 我 们 列 祖 享 受 其 上 的 土 产 ， 并 美 物 之 地 ， 看 哪 ， 我 们 在 这 地 上 作 了 奴 仆 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;Now, today, we are servants, and as for the land which you gave to our fathers, so that the produce of it and the good might be theirs, see, we are servants in it:
<br>9:37&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;这 地 许 多 出 产 归 了 列 王 ， 就 是 你 因 我 们 的 罪 所 派 辖 制 我 们 的 。 他 们 任 意 辖 制 我 们 的 身 体 和 牲 畜 ， 我 们 遭 了 大 难 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And it gives much increase to the kings whom you have put over us because of our sins: and they have power over our bodies and over our cattle at their pleasure, and we are in great trouble.
<br>9:38&nbsp;[hgb] &nbsp;因 这 一 切 的 事 ， 我 们 立 确 实 的 约 ， 写 在 册 上 。 我 们 的 首 领 ， 利 未 人 ， 和 祭 司 都 签 了 名 。
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[kjv] &nbsp;And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;[bbe] &nbsp;And because of all this we are making an agreement in good faith, and putting it in writing; and our rulers, our Levites, and our priests are putting their names to it.
