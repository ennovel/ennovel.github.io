At this market vegetables were sold, and butter, and eggs, and cheese, and fruit, and many other nice things.
<br> 
<br> Tuesday was a miserable day for the poor donkeys, and especially for me. I belonged to a farmer’s wife, and she was very severe and ill-tempered. Just think! every week she used to load up my back with all the eggs her hens laid,2 all the butter and cheese she made from the milk of her cows, all the vegetables and fruit that were ready for market out of her garden. Then she would get on the top of all this and beat me with a hard, knotty stick because my poor thin legs didn’t carry her to market with all that load as fast as she liked. I trotted, I almost galloped, but that farmer’s wife whipped me all the same. I used to get very angry at such cruelty and injustice. I tried to kick her off, but I was loaded down too heavily, and so I could only wobble about from side to side; but I did have the satisfaction of knowing that she was well jolted. Then she would growl, “Ah, you wretched animal! see if I don’t teach you to wobble!” and she would beat me again till I could scarcely keep on my legs.
<br> 
<br> One day we reached the market-town in this way, and the baskets with which my poor back had been nearly crushed were taken off and set down upon the ground. My mistress hitched me to a post, and went away to get her dinner. I was dying of hunger and thirst, but nobody thought of offering me a single blade of grass or a drop of water. While the farmer’s wife was away, I managed to get my head close to the basket of vegetables, and made a dinner of the cabbages and lettuces. I never tasted anything so good.
<br>

<br> 
<br> I had just finished the last cabbage and the last lettuce in that basket when my mistress came back. She cried out when she saw the empty basket, and I looked at her with such an impudent and self-satisfied air, that she at once guessed that I was the culprit. I won’t repeat to you the mean things she said to me. When she was angry she used language which was enough to make me blush, donkey as I am. So after heaping me with abuse, of which I took no notice, she seized her stick and began to beat me so severely, that at last I lost patience and launched out three kicks. The first kick broke her nose and two teeth, the second sprained her wrist, and the third knocked her flat.
<br> 
<br> A score of people at once set upon me and knocked me about. They picked up my mistress and carried her away, leaving me fastened to the post, by the side of which were spread out the things I had brought to be sold in the market. I remained there a long while, and finding that no one paid any more attention to me, I ate a second basketful of excellent vegetables, and then with my teeth I gnawed through the cord that tied me up, and quietly took the road home.
<br> 
<br> The people I passed on the way were astonished to see me all alone.
<br> 
<br> “Look,” said one, “see that ass with the broken nose! He has run away.”
<br>

<br> 
<br> “Then he has run away from prison,” said the other, and they all began to laugh.
<br> 
<br> “He doesn’t carry a heavy load upon his back,” said a third.
<br> 
<br> “Certainly he has done some mischief,” a fourth one said.
<br> 
<br> “Catch him and we will put the little one upon his back,” said a woman.
<br> 
<br> “He will carry you as well as the little boy,” answered her husband.
<br> 
<br> I, wishing to give a good opinion of my kindness and good will, came gently towards the country woman and stopped near her to let her mount upon my back.
<br> 
<br> “He doesn’t seem a bad sort!” said the man, helping his wife to the saddle.
<br> 
<br> I smiled with pity on hearing this remark. Bad! as if a donkey kindly treated were ever bad! We become angry, disobedient, and obstinate only to revenge ourselves for the blows and injuries we receive. When we are well treated we are good,—much better, in fact, than many other animals.
<br> 
<br> I took the young woman and her little child of two years back to their home; they stroked me, were very much pleased with me, and would willingly have kept me.
<br> 
<br> But it was, I thought, not honest to stay with them. My masters had bought me and I be5longed to them. I had already broken my mistress’s nose, teeth, and wrist, and had kicked her in the stomach. I was sufficiently revenged.
<br> I jumped clean over the Hedge.
<br> “I jumped clean over the Hedge.
<br> 
<br> Seeing that the mother was going to give in to her little boy (who I noticed was a spoiled child), I jumped to one side, and before the mother could catch my bridle again, I ran away at a gallop and came back to my home.
<br> 
<br> Mary, my mistress’s little girl, saw me come back.
<br> 
<br> “Hallo, here’s Neddy,” she said; “how early he is! Jim, come and take off his pack-saddle.”
<br>

<br> 
<br> “That wretched donkey!” growled Jim; “always something to be done for him! Why is he alone? I suspect he has run away from mother.”
<br> 
<br> My saddle and bridle were taken off, and I galloped away to the meadow. Suddenly I heard shrieks. I looked over the hedge, and saw some men carrying my mistress home. Then I heard Jim say:—
<br> 
<br> “I say, father, I’m going to take the cart-whip, and I shall tie that donkey to a tree, and then whip him till he can’t stand.”
<br> 
<br> “All right, my lad,” said my master, “but mind and don’t kill him, for he cost money. I’ll sell him next fair-day.”
<br> 
<br> I shuddered when I heard this. There wasn’t a moment to be lost. This time I did not care whether they lost their money or not. I made a run and jumped clean over the hedge. Then I ran till I was out of sight and hearing in the depths of a beautiful large forest, where there was plenty of soft grass to eat, and plenty of sparkling brooks to drink from.
