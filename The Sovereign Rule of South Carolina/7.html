Her condition attracted sundry persons to the end of the wharf, who viewed her with a sort of commiseration that might have been taken for sincere feeling. The boarding officer had received her papers, and reported her character and condition, which had aroused a feeling of speculative curiosity, that was already beginning to spread among ship-carpenters and outfitters.</p> 
<p>Conspicuous among those gathered on the wharf was a diminutive little dandy, with an olive-colored frock-coat, black pants, embroidered vest, and an enormous shirt-collar that endangered his ears. This was secured around the neck with a fancy neckcloth, very tastefully set off with a diamond pin, He was very slender, with a narrow, feminine face, round popeyes--requiring the application of a pocket-glass every few minutes--and very fair complexion, with little positive expression of character in his features. His nose was pointed; his chin, projected and covered with innumerable little pimples, gave an irregular and mastiff-shaped mouth a peculiar expression. He wore a very highly-polished and high-heeled pair of boots, and a broad-brimmed, silk-smooth hat. He seemed very anxious to display the beauty of two diamond rings that glittered upon his delicate little fingers, made more conspicuous by the wristbands of his shirt. Standing in a very conspicuous place upon the capsill of the wharf, he would rub his hands, then running from one part of the wharf to another, ordering sundry niggers about making fast the lines, kicking one, and slapping another, as he stooped, with his little hand. All paid respect to him. The Captain viewed him with a smile of curiosity, as much as to say, "What important specimen of a miss in breeches is that?" But when the little fellow spoke, the secret was told. He gathered the inflections of his voice, as if he were rolling them over the little end of a thunderbolt in his mouth. As the vessel touched the wharf, he sprang to the corner and cried out at the top of his voice, "Yer' welcome to Charleston, Captain Thompson! Where did you get that knocking?--where are ye bound for?--how many days are you out?--how long has she leaked in that way?" and a strain of such questions, which it would be impossible to trace, such was the rapidity with which he put them. The Captain answered him in accordance with the circumstances; and supposing him clothed with authority, inquired where he should find some hands to work his pumps, in order to relieve his men. "By-Je-w-hu! Captain, you must a' had a piping time, old feller. Oh! yes, you want help to work your pumps. Get niggers, Captain, there's lots on 'em about here. They're as thick as grasshoppers in a cotton-patch."</p> 
<p>"Yes, but I want 'em now, my men are worn out; I must get some Irishmen, if I can't get others at once," said the Captain, viewing his man again from head to foot.</p> 
<p>"Oh! don't employ Paddies, Captain; 'ta'n't popular; they don't belong to the secession party; Charleston's overrun with them and the Dutch! Why, she won't hurt to lay till to-morrow morning, and there'll be lots o' niggers down; they can't be out after bell-ring without a pass, and its difficult to find their masters after dark. Haul her up 'till she grounds, and she won't leak when the tide leaves her. We can go to the theatre and have a right good supper after, at Baker's or the St. Charles's. It's the way our folks live. We live to enjoy ourselves in South Carolina. Let the old wreck go to-night." The little fellow seemed so extremely polite, and so anxious to "do the genteel attention," that the Captain entirely forgot the tenor of his conversation with the pilot, while his feelings changed with the prospect of such respectful attention; and yet he seemed at a loss how to analyze the peculiar character of his little, pedantic friend.</p> 
<p>"You must not think me intrusive, Captain," said he, pulling out his segar-pouch and presenting it with at Chesterfieldian politeness. "It's a pleasure we Carolinians take in being hospitable and attentive to strangers. My name, sir, is--! My niggers call me Master George. Yes, sir! our family!--you have heard of my father probably--he belongs to one of the best stocks in Carolina--owns a large interest in this wharf, and is an extensive cotton-broker, factors, we call them here--and he owns a large plantation of niggers on Pee-Dee; you must visit our plantation. Captain, certain! before you leave the city. But you mustn't pay much attention to the gossip you'll hear about the city. I pledge you my honor, sir, it don't amount to any thing, nor has it any prominent place in our society."</p> 
<p>"Really, sir," replied the Captain, "I shall do myself the honor to accept of your hospitable kindness, and hope it may be my good fortune to reciprocate at some future day. I'm only too sorry that our wrecked condition affords me no opportunity to invite you to my table to-night; but the circumstances which you see everywhere presenting themselves are my best apology."</p> 
<p>"Oh, dear me! don't mention it, I pray, Captain. Just imagine yourself perfectly at home. We will show you what Southern hospitality is. We don't go upon the Yankee system of Mr. So-and-so and What-do-ye-call-'um. Our feelings are in keeping with our State pride, which, with our extreme sensibility of honor, forbids the countenance of meanness. South Carolinians, sir, are at the very top of the social ladder--awake to every high-minded consideration of justice and right. We are not moved by those morbid excitements and notions that so often lead people away at the North. Make no unnecessary preparation, Captain, and I will do myself the honor to call upon you in an hour." Thus saying, he shook his hand and left.</p> 
<p>The pilot had delivered his charge safe, and was about to, bid the Captain good-by for the night. But in order to do the thing in accordance with an English custom, that appears to have lost none of its zest in South Carolina, he was invited into the Captain's cabin to take a little prime old Jamaica. Manuel, who had somewhat recovered, brought out the case from a private locker, and setting it before them, they filled up, touched glasses, and drank the usual standing toast to South Carolina. "Pilot," said the Captain, "who is my polite friend--he seems a right clever little fellow?"</p> 
<p>"Well, Captain, he's little, but he's first-rate blood, and a genuine sprig of the chivalry. He's a devil of a secessionist, sir. If ye were to hear that fellow make a stump speech on States' rights, you'd think him a Samson on Government. His father is the head of a good mercantile house here; 'twouldn't be a bad idea to consign to him. But I must bid you good-night, Captain; I'll call and see you to-morrow," said the pilot, leaving for his home.</p> 
<p>The Janson was hauled well up the dock, and grounded on the ebb-tide. Manuel prepared supper for the officers and crew, while the Captain awaited the return of his new acquaintance. "Captain," said Manuel, "I should like to go ashore to-night and take a walk, for my bones are sore, and I'm full of pains. I think it will do me good. You don't think anybody will trouble me, if I walk peaceably along?"</p> 
<p>"Nobody would trouble you if they knew you, Manuel; but I am afraid they will mistake you in the night. You had better keep ship until morning; take a good rest, and to-morrow will be a fine day--you can then take some exercise."</p> 
<p>Manuel looked at the Captain as if he read something doubtful in his countenance, and turned away with a pitiful look of dissatisfaction. It seems that through his imperfect knowledge of English, he had misconceived the position of the celebrated Thomas Norman Gadsden, whom he imagined to be something like an infernal machine, made and provided by the good citizens of Charleston to catch bad niggers. "Nora-ma Gazine no catch-e me, Cap-i-tan, if me go ashore, 'case me no make trouble in no part de world where me sail, Oh! no, Cap-i-tan, Manuel know how to mine dis bisness," said he returning again to the Captain.</p> 
<p>"Yes, yes, Manuel, but we can't let the crew go ashore 'till we get through the custom-house; you must content yourself to-night, and in the morning 'twill be all right. I'm afraid you'll get sick again-the night-air is very bad in this climate; old Gadsden won't trouble you. He don't walk about at night."</p> 
<p>Manuel walked forward, not very well satisfied with the manner in which the Captain put him off. The latter felt the necessity of caution, fearing he might infringe upon some of the municipal regulations that the pilot had given him an account of, which accounted for his refusal Manuel sat upon the main-hatch fondling Tommy, and telling him what good things they would have in the morning for breakfast, and how happy they ought to be that they were not lost during the gales, little thinking that he was to be the victim of a merciless law, which would confine him within the iron grates of a prison before the breakfast hour in the morning. "I like Charleston, Tommy," said Manuel; "it looks like one of our old English towns, and the houses have such pretty gardens, and the people they say are all so rich and live so fine. Tommy, we'll have a long walk and look all around it, so that we can tell the folks when we get home. The ship, owes me eleven pounds, and I mean to take some good things home for presents, to show what they have in South Carolina."</p> 
<p>"You better buy a young nigger, and take him home as a curiosity to show among the Highlands. You can buy a young Sambo for any price, just the same as you would a leg of mutton at the butcher's; put him in a band-box, lug him across, and you'll make a fortune in the North country. But I'd rather buy a young wife, for the young niggers are more roguish than a lot o' snakes, and al'a's eat their heads off afore they're big enough to toddle. They sell gals here for niggers whiter than you are, Manuel; they sell 'em at auction, and then they sell corn to feed 'em on. Carolina's a great region of supersensual sensibility; they give you a wife of any color or beauty, and don't charge you much for her, providing you're the right stripe. What a funny thing it would be to show the Glasgow folks a bright specimen of a bought wife from the renowned State of South Carolina, with genuine aristocratic blood in her veins; yes, a pure descendant of the Huguenots!" said the mate, who was leaning over the rail where Manuel and Tommy were seated, smoking a segar and viewing the beautiful scenery around the harbor.</p> 
<p>"Ah!" said Manuel, "when I get a wife and live on shore, I don't want to buy one-it might be a dangerous bargain. Might buy the body, but not the soul-that's God's."</p>
