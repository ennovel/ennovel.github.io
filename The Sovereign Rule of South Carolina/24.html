He was in close confinement, through Mr. Grimshaw's orders. Tommy continued to bring him food from day to day, but was not allowed to see him. The mate and several of the crew were also refused admittance to him. This was carrying power to an unnecessary limit, and inflicting a wanton punishment without proper cause, at the same time exhibiting a flagrant disrespect for personal feelings. Tommy did not report the affair to the Captain, lest it should be misconstrued, and worse punishment be inflicted; but when the men were refused, they naturally mistrusted something, and made inquiries of the jailer, who readily gave them all the information in his power concerning the affair, and his orders. This they reported to the Captain, who immediately repaired to the consul's office, where he found Mr. Mathew reading a note which he had just received from Manuel. It stated his grievances in a clear and distinct manner, and begged the protection of that government under whose flag he sailed, but said nothing about his provisions. The consul, accompanied by the Captain, proceeded to the sheriff's office, but could get no satisfaction. "I never consider circumstances when prisoners violate the rules of the jail,--he must await my orders! but I shall keep him closely confined for two weeks, at least," said Mr. Grimshaw.</p> 
<p>This incensed the consul still more, for he saw the manner in which a clique of officials were determined to show their arbitrary power. It was impossible for him to remain indifferent to this matter, affecting, as it did, the life and liberty of his fellow-countryman. He could invoke no sympathy for the man, and the extent of punishment to which he had been subjected was evidently excited by vindictive feelings. He applied for a writ of habeas corpus,--but mark the result.</p> 
<p>The Captain proceeded to the jail, and demanded to see his steward; the jailer hesitating at first, at length granted his permission. He found Manuel locked up in a little, unwholesome cell, with scarcely a glimmer of light to mark the distinction of day and night; and so pale and emaciated, that had he met him in the street he should scarcely have recognised him. "Gracious God! What crime could have brought such an excess of punishment upon you?" inquired the Captain.</p> 
<p>Manuel told him the whole story; and, added to that, the things which had been sent to him during the seven days he had been confined in that manner, had seldom reached him. He had lost his good friend Jane, and the many kind acts which she was wont to bestow upon him, and had been compelled to live upon bread and water nearly the whole time, suffering the most intense hunger. Upon inquiry, it was ascertained that the few things sent to make him comfortable had been intrusted to Daley to deliver, who appropriated nearly the whole of them to his own use, as a sort of retaliatory measure for the castigation he received from Manuel. He had not failed to carry him his pan of soup at twelve o'clock every day, but made the "choice bits" serve his own digestion. The jailer felt the pain of the neglect, and promised to arrange a safer process of forwarding his things by attending to it himself, which he did with all the attention in his power, when Manuel's condition became more tolerable. The Captain told Manuel how his affairs stood-that he should probably have to leave him in charge of the consul, but to keep up good spirits; that he would leave him plenty of means, and as soon as his release was effected, to make the best of his way to Scotland and join the old owners. And thus he left him, with a heavy heart, for Manuel did read in his countenance what he did not speak.</p> 
<p>The Janson had been discharged, a survey held upon the cargo, protest extended, and the whole sold for the benefit of whom it might concern. Necessary surveys were likewise held upon the hull, and finding it so old and strained as to be unworthy of repair, it was condemned and sold for the benefit of the underwriters. Thus the register "de novo" was given up to the consul, the men discharged, and paid off according to the act of William IV., which provides that each man shall receive a stipend to carry him to the port in Great Britain from which he shipped, or the consul to provide passage for him, according to his inclination, to proceed to a point where the voyage would be completed. The consul adopted the best means in his power to make them all comfortable and satisfied with their discharge. Their several register-tickets were given up to them, and one by one left for his place of destination; Tommy and the second mate only preferring to remain and seek some new voyage. The old chief mate seemed to congratulate himself in the condemnation of the unlucky Janson. He shipped on board an English ship, laden with cotton and naval stores, and just ready for sea. When he came on board to take a farewell of the Captain, he stood upon deck, and looking up at the dismantled spars, said, "Skipper, a shadow may save a body after all. I've always had a presentment that this unlucky old thing would serve us a trick. I says to meself that night in the Gulf, 'Well, old craft, yer goin' to turn yer old ribs into a coffin, at last,' but I'll praise the bridge that carries me safe over, because I've an affection for the old thing after all, and can't part without saying God bless her, for it's an honest death to die in debt to the underwriters. I hope her old bones will rest in peace on terra-firma. Good-by, Captain,--remember me to Manuel; and let us forget our troubles in Charleston by keeping away from it."</p>
