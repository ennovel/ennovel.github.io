THE BARQUE</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      Henry led the way through the streets until we came to the anchorage basin beyond the docks. He was talkative enough, but my head ached from the blow I had received from the man of peace, and I paid little attention to the fellow’s words.
<br> 
<br> We passed a large American ship that had been captured by the English during the war and sold. She loomed up grandly from the small craft lying near, her long, tapering masts still showing the unmistakable Yankee rigging, and her yards having yet a vestige of the white American cloth which has since been a pleasant feature of all our craft. Her paint was worn off, however, and upon her decks a mongrel crew chattered away like a pack of monkeys. I halted a moment and looked at her in disgust.
<br> 
<br> “What ship is that?” I asked.
<br> 
<br> “The Independence of Boston. She were taken by the English line ship St. Marys off Cape St. Roque. She were stove up some. See that big piece spliced into her stern where she was shot 19away. Her mainyard’s fished in two places. Took two whole broadsides to fetch her to, they say. That trim-lookin’ craft beyond her is the one we’re headin’ fer,--the one laying head on with the foreyards cockbilled.”
<br> 
<br> We went toward the vessel indicated, and I soon saw what indeed appeared to be a fine craft. She was large, probably five hundred tons, but she was barque rigged, with her mainmast stepped well aft. Her foreyards were lifted to starboard and her main were braced to all angles, giving her the appearance of having been suddenly deserted by her crew after making port. Upon the spars the white canvas lay bent and furled, the clews standing out a foot or two clear of the bunt, and the gaskets hove in taut as brass bands. Her black sides showed a good freeboard, but I thought little of this, as nearly all vessels bound to the westward were going pretty light at that time. She was coppered, and the top band was a good half-fathom clear of the water. She was pierced for six guns on a side, and had several more ports painted along the bulwarks on the main-deck, as was the custom of the day. At a distance she might have been taken for a vessel of twenty or more guns. Her build was English, but her rig was Scandinavian, and I noticed her poop was painted white everywhere except on deck, after the Yankee fashion.
<br> 
<br> 20Three heavy boats were slung amidships on booms. Forward of these a galley was built or lashed upon the deck, and from its window appeared the black head of an African. We went close to the water’s edge and Henry hailed.
<br> 
<br> “Th-war-bull-yah! Ahoy!” he bellowed.
<br> 
<br> “What’s her name?” I asked.
<br> 
<br> “Ha-Yah-Wah, ahoy!” he bellowed again in answer, and the nigger in the galley waved a white rag in reply.
<br> 
<br> “May the sharks eat me, you dock wrastler, but that’s a queer name for a fine ship! How do you call her?” I asked.
<br> 
<br> “He’s comin’ now,” said Henry, with a grin. “Names is mostly just sounds, an’ furrin sounds is just like others, only different. We’ll go aboard her, and you can see the old man an’ settle with him. Don’t be afraid o’ high pay. He’ll give it.”
<br> 
<br> In a few minutes a boat left the barque from the side opposite us, where it had been out of sight. It rounded under her stern and came toward us, with the nigger standing aft sculling with the peculiar swing of the Bahama conch. He landed almost at our feet, and Henry motioned me to jump aboard.
<br> 
<br> “Ole man aboard, hey?” asked Henry, stepping in after me.
<br> 
<br> “Yassir, disha boat just done taken him abo’d. He’s done expected mos’ all han’s afo’ dis.”
<br> 
<br> 21“Well, take us over,” said Henry, and he settled himself heavily upon a thwart.
<br> 
<br> In a short time we were alongside. We clambered up a long hanging ladder amidships, and then over the rail to the main-deck.
<br> 
<br> As we did so a venerable, white-haired old fellow stepped out of the cabin door and greeted us.
<br> 
<br> Henry took off his cap and bowed with uncommon civility.
<br> 
<br> “Captain Watkins, allow me to make known Mr.--Mr.--”
<br> 
<br> “Heywood,” I suggested.
<br> 
<br> “Mr. Heywood,” continued Henry. “He is the best mate in Havre, an’ is just off the American ship Washington. I knowed you wanted a good mate, so I brought you the best in town.”
<br> 
<br> The old fellow held out his hand gravely, and said how glad he was to make my acquaintance.
<br> 
<br> “I am just looking for a good navigator, and if you’ll come at my terms, I’ll reckon we’ll deal.”
<br> 
<br> I suggested that the terms be made known.
<br> 
<br> “Well, I reckon on thirty pound a month is all I allow just now. Will you consider that?”
<br> 
<br> As this was five times as much as any mate I had ever heard of received, I told him I would consider the matter closed.
<br> 
<br> “An’ your friend, here. I take it he is an American, too,--an’ a sailorman from clew to earring.”
<br> 
<br> 22Richards looked at him steadily.
<br> 
<br> “You are a right smart of a guesser, Mr. Watkins,” said he. “I was second in the Washington, but I’ve been in better ships.”
<br> 
<br> The insolence of old Peter calling the captain mister was almost too much for me. Here was a chance of a lifetime. I turned upon him.
<br> 
<br> “If you are going to act foolish with one drink of ale, just for a chance to back down, you better get ashore,” I snapped.
<br> 
<br> “I’ve seen many men more sensible drunk than you are sober, Heywood,” said he, looking calmly at me, “but I’ll not back down.”
<br> 
<br> “Will you accept the same terms?” asked the old man, kindly.
<br> 
<br> Richards looked at him in scorn. Then he spat on the white deck.
<br> 
<br> “I’ll go,” said he, and Captain Watkins turned to me.
<br> 
<br> “There is no grog served aboard, and no swearing on this ship, Mr. Heywood,” said he. “I am an old man, as you see, and wish my crew orderly and quiet. Do you wish to stay aboard at once?”
<br> 
<br> I said I would just as soon turn to at once. The rate of pay fairly frightened me, and I was afraid if I went ashore he might get some one else in my place. The appearance of the barque was much in her favour. Her decks were as white as holystone 23could make them, and her gear was all new and carefully selected. Such lines seldom found place upon any ships save men-of-war, and her blocks, with polished brass pins and sheaves, were marvels to me. I stood idly pulling a topsail brace with one hand and looking up at the fine rigging, while Henry talked of his tip for bringing me. Even the sheer-poles were polished brass. The old fellow finally led us below, and handed Henry a small gold piece, and then offered me a few pounds in advance, requesting me to sign a receipt for the same. This I did, and then Henry left, shaking me heartily by the hand as he went over the side. I returned his grip, for I felt he had indeed been my friend.
<br> 
<br> “You may take the port room there, Mr. Heywood, and put your things shipshape as soon as Henry gets them off your vessel. If the second or third mate comes aft to see me, don’t fail to call me,--er--er, you know I’m quite without officers, sir, but will probably have both them and a crew aboard soon. The papers have not been made out yet, but I believe I have your receipt for your advance. Witnessed by Henry, it will do, I suppose, but I am not afraid of you, Mr. Heywood. You don’t look like a man to take advantage of a ship’s generosity.” Then he went aft, and I went to the 24port room. It meant that I was first mate, and I opened the door with a high heart.
<br> 
<br> There was nothing at all in the stateroom save an old clay pipe and a twist of tobacco. The bunk was bare, and I sat upon the edge of it speculating upon my good fortune. Finally I lit the pipe and smoked. The smoke wreaths rolled upward, and, as I watched them, I built many pleasant things in the future.
<br> 
<br> How long I dreamed I don’t know, but it was quite late in the afternoon when I heard a hail from the shore that sounded like Henry’s. I went on deck and met the nigger coming from the galley to the boat. I noticed what a strapping buck the fellow was, and he saw me watching him.
<br> 
<br> “Disha hooker’ll have er crew soon. Yassir, she will dat,” said he, grinning and showing a row of teeth almost as pointed and white as those of a shark. Then he climbed over the rail, and was soon sculling to the shore, where I saw Henry and two men waiting.
<br> 
<br> They came aboard and were ushered into the cabin by the venerable skipper, whom I had awakened.
<br> 
<br> “This is Mr. Martin,” said Henry, introducing the first one with the air of a man presenting a lord. The fellow pulled off his hat and squared his shoulders, and then looked somewhat disturbed by this 25mark of respect. He was clean shaven, with a great broad head set upon an enormous pair of shoulders. He was short but powerfully built, and his bright eyes were restless. He was no drunken ship-rat, but a strong, healthy sailor.
<br> 
<br> “Mr. Martin, it gives me pleasure to meet you, sir. As I understand you wish to sign as second mate, I present you to Mr. Heywood, the first officer,” and he nodded to me with a graceful sweep of the hand. He had evidently forgotten Richards, but I did not feel inclined to remind him at that moment.
<br> 
<br> The fellow looked at me and scowled, at the same time nodding. This sort of thing was more than he had expected. Then he broke forth in broad Scotch that he would sign or go ashore.
<br> 
<br> “Would twenty pound a month do you?” asked the skipper, wistfully.
<br> 
<br> The fellow did not understand. The amount probably dazed him. Captain Watkins repeated the offer.
<br> 
<br> “Weel an’ guid! weel an’ guid!” he cried, slapping his stout leg. “Let’s have a squint o’ th’ goold.”
<br> 
<br> “I shall be glad to hand you a few pounds at once in advance,” said the old skipper. “Please sign this receipt for four pounds,” and so saying, he produced the money.
<br> 
<br> 26The fellow put it in his clothes and signed the paper at once.
<br> 
<br> His companion stepped up. He was a Swede and blond. His blue eyes were bleary with liquor, and the old man looked at him and shook his head sadly.
<br> 
<br> “No drinkin’ and no swearin’ aboard here, my friend--er--er--”
<br> 
<br> “Anderson,” said Henry.
<br> 
<br> “No drinking here, Mr. Anderson. If you’ll accept fifteen pounds a month and three pounds in advance, just scratch off a receipt and we’ll finish up and have dinner.”
<br> 
<br> This was done and the two men saw Henry over the side, giving him, as I had done, a good tip for his kind interest in getting them such fine berths. Then the big nigger cleared the table and brought in a very substantial meal, at which the captain and we mates fell to.
<br> 
<br> I was not a little astonished at the appearance of Richards. He was all cleaned up and wore a scarf tied under his newly shaved chin. He was always neat in appearance, but here he was, without anything apparently to tog out with, all rigged as fine as though he were going ashore. His smooth face, sunburned and lined as it was from exposure, seemed to tell of much hardship in the past. He was a solemn-looking fellow at best, and to see him togged out in this shape, with his hands washed and old 27clothes brushed, was strange. He took his place at the table without a word.
<br> 
<br> “You see,” said Captain Watkins, looking at me with his sharp eyes, “I believe in the equality of all men.”
<br> 
<br> I nodded, for it was not often the mates and sailors of a ship had a chance to eat in the forward cabin of a vessel, especially together. The Scotchman, Martin, eyed the old fellow narrowly. We could not all be mates.
<br> 
<br> “One man’s as good as another, and sometimes even better,” said Richards, softly.
<br> 
<br> “That’s it. Even a black man is as good as a white one. Some people don’t think so, but I know it’s so,” said the skipper.
<br> 
<br> “I’ve seen some I thought better,” said Richards, helping himself to a piece of boiled meat, “but it don’t keep people from jerking them up for slaves when they get a chance.”
<br> 
<br> “I have known slavers,” said the old man, gently, “but they are a rough set and capable of any crime. On our last voyage one of those fellows wanted to visit me during a calm, but I was afraid of him and warned him away. A desperate-looking set they were.”
<br> 
<br> “Must have frightened you badly,” sneered Richards.
<br> 
<br> The old skipper looked at the sailor. There was 28something like sadness in his voice as he answered.
<br> 
<br> “I’m of a somewhat timid nature, but cannot help it. I cannot stand seeing poor coloured folk made to suffer. You will know me better after you have sailed with me for a voyage.”
<br> 
<br> I thought I saw just the glimmer of a smile around the corners of his mouth as he said this, and looked for some reply from my talkative mate. Richards made no further remark, and the conversation turned to more sailor-like topics.
<br> 
<br> We talked rather late, as the skipper was most fatherly in his manner, and, when the fellow Martin suggested he would go ashore and get his dunnage, it was found that Henry had taken the boat without the nigger, and had not sent it back aboard.
<br> 
<br> “It is of no great consequence, I hope,” said Watkins. “You two, Mr. Heywood and Richards, may turn in the port room; you, Mr. Martin and Mr. Anderson, to starboard, and perhaps in the morning I can let you have the day ashore.”
<br> 
<br> Then we separated. Richards and I tossed a coin to see who would get the bunk, and I won. I arranged my coat for a pillow and soon fell asleep, leaving my roommate to shift for himself on the deck.
<br> 
<br> Once or twice during the night I thought I heard stealthy footsteps overhead, and once it seemed to 29me that the barque was heeling over a bit. Finally I was awakened by a loud banging at my door, and, springing up, found it was broad day. Then it suddenly dawned upon me that the barque was under way.
<br> 
<br> Opening the door, I found a strange fellow scowling at me. He was dressed as a common sailor and was a bit drunk.
<br> 
<br> It is just as well to start discipline right aboard a ship, thought I, so I hitched my trousers’ belt the tighter before sailing in to show how an American mate whangs the deviltry and liquor out of a foreign skin when aroused from pleasant dreams. I noticed the absence of Richards, but thought he had already turned out for duty. Then I accosted the fellow and asked softly what he wanted.
<br> 
<br> “What cher doin’ in my room, yer bloomin’ swine?” he howled. “Git out an’--”
<br> 
<br> I had stopped him with a right swing on the jaw, and the next instant we were loping about that cabin in fine style. In a moment there was a rush of feet, and something crashed on my head. Then followed stars and darkness.
