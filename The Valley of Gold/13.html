It was the hour of noon and Mary McClure was busy placing some afternoon work upon the blackboard. A sound on the porch caused her to hold her flying hand. In a little there was a rap at the door and a giant form stepped in.
<br> 
<br> "Good-day, lassie," said the deep voice of Ed. Pullar.
<br> 
<br> "Well, Mr. Pullar!" was the girl's cordial greeting as she turned toward him. "How glad I am to see you. Have you news of The Red Knight?"
<br> 
<br> The venerable face was wreathed in smiles. The happiness boded good tidings.
<br> 
<br> Bowing with cavalier grace he replied:
<br> 
<br> "Here is the communication. I want you to read it, lassie."
<br> 
<br> Stepping lightly to him she took the sheet and pored over it swiftly. Its contents were of extreme interest to her. It ran:
<br> 
<br> DEAR SIR:
<br> 
<br> Doubtless you have received my letter acknowledging the safe arrival of your packages of Red Knight. The tests are proceeding apace and already we are able to report results that may be of far-reaching import to the grain growers of the WORLD. They will assuredly be gratifying to you.
<br> 
<br> Your samples have been subjected to an exhaustive series of milling tests, disclosing the presence in Red Knight of ASTONISHING MILLING PROPERTIES.
<br> 
<br> Also, we have studied carefully your very complete history of the discovery and isolation of the new variety and find that throughout the germination tests up to the present stage, our observations have resulted in a remarkable parallel of your own record.
<br> 
<br> On the afternoon of the nineteenth we are holding a Staff Conference to consult on the phases of Red Knight, referred to above, with a view to consider the speeding up of test operations. The imminency of the ensuing seed-time demands this if we are to launch comprehensive field tests in ALL OUR NATIONAL FARMS.
<br> 
<br> At the close of the Conference an informal luncheon will be tendered to the DISCOVERERS of THE RED KNIGHT. We request the presence of yourself and your son as the honourable guests of the occasion.
<br> 
<br> I have the honour to be, sir,
<br> 
<br> Your obedient servant,
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JOHN T. C. NORRGRENE,
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Minister of Agriculture.
<br> 
<br> As she finished Mary clasped the letter to her breast, lost in a moment's pensiveness. Then she lifted to the earnest face above her eyes aglow with a brimming pleasure.
<br> 
<br> "You will go, Mr. Pullar!" she cried delightedly. "You will go, of course, both you and Ned."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, I will go," was the quiet reply. "I have no desire now to tramp abroad but I am going to do whatever I can to help these great men discover the true character of The Red Knight. Ned is coming with me. Dad Blackford will take care of the farm. It is a great moment for Ned and me."
<br> 
<br> The gray head lifted with a perceptible pride.
<br> 
<br> "Mr. Pullar!" she cried, stepping nearer to him. "Do I look pleased?"
<br> 
<br> He read the girl's face.
<br> 
<br> "Aye! It is so, lassie. 'Tis the bonny bit you have been with your bright, loyal heart."
<br> 
<br> "I am more than pleased," returned Mary. "I am elated. It means that your big, noble plans will be realized. There can be no hitch now. The Red Knight is doing splendid work alone, but when you and Ned join forces with him you will be irresistible. I see glorious times ahead."
<br> 
<br> The old man looked deep into the eyes bright with the magic of a great hope.
<br> 
<br> "Bonny Mary!" said he gently. "Bonny Mary!—that is what I have been calling you in my secret mind.—You have been a right wonderful blessing to me for you—you believe in me. And your beauty and tenderness they have been recalling the past these happy hours in the wee school-house. I cannot thank you——"
<br> 
<br> "Hush, Mr. Pullar!" was her gentle interruption. "You cannot thank people for their—their regard, for their—love. You—you just do it too. You love them back. Do you not?"
<br> 
<br> The na?ve, girlish innocence touched him. Placing a great hand gently on her head he stooped down and brushed her brow ever so lightly with his lips.
<br> 
<br> "God bless you, lassie!" was the reverent benediction.
<br> 
<br> She watched him go out, his face beautiful with a new light.
<br> 
<br> On the edge of the clearing he halted and looked back to the school.
<br> 
<br> "Aye! God bless you, lassie!" was his whisper. "May He keep the light o' laughter always in your bonny eyes! Always!"
<br> 
<br> The proud form that vanished into the trees was not unlike the strong young Apollo who wooed the dainty Kitty Belaire. Old Ed. Pullar was putting up a fight, the stress of which was known to only two. Ned realized it by the insight of his great affection; and Mary by the tender intuition of her woman's heart.
