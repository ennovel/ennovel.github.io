Not until everything was snug from the storm did he think of indulging in his evening solace. While dreaming amid the blue circles of smoke there came to him Ned's admonition about The Red Knight. It was his last word.
<br> 
<br> "See that no harm comes to The Red Knight, Dad," was Ned's laughing caution. "It is the one thing on the farm that Dad would not part with."
<br> 
<br> "Ah!" said the old man with sudden decision, "I maun take a turn hout to the barn. The snow moight 'arm the bonny corn."
<br> 
<br> Lighting his lantern he went out and was gratified to find that the grain was snugly secure. When he came in he went to the room where lay the two hundred bushels. Opening the door he flashed his lantern about. Here, too, all was weather-tight. At sight of the pile of wonderful wheat he exclaimed in admiration. Picking up a handful he held it close to the light.
<br> 
<br> "'Ee's wealthy-loike!" said the old man, caressing the plump brown grains with his fingers. "'Ee's the fat corn und 'evvy! The old un'll make a pile on un."
<br> 
<br> Shutting the door he returned to his pipe and dreamed of visions of riches in store for Ned and his father, his innocent old face glowing with pleasure at the contemplation of their good fortune. Rising at length he went to the door, took a long look out into the black night, then shut it carefully and retired to his bed.
<br> 
<br> It was nearing the hour of midnight when he was aroused from sleep by a thumping upon the door. Rising he threw up the sash and looked down.
<br> 
<br> "Hello! Is that Mr. Blackford?" called an anxious voice.
<br> 
<br> "Hit be," was the succinct response.
<br> 
<br> "I am from Jake McCarragh's. One of his mares is down and he wants you to come over and give us a hand."
<br> 
<br> "Ah! 'Ee's a 'orse sick. Ah'll coome along," was the kind response.
<br> 
<br> "I'm on the hike," said the voice below. "I'll foot it back on the double quick and help Jake. You hurry after as fast as you can."
<br> 
<br> The case was evidently urgent.
<br> 
<br> "Hal roight, go a'ead. Ah'll be along," replied the old man, hastening to dress.
<br> 
<br> In a short time he was ready and stepped out into the storm, trudging down the lane and off into the north with the blizzard in his face. He did not hear the muffled beat of galloping hoofs as he emerged into the road-allowance.
<br> 
<br> As we have mentioned before, there were pedestrians about the drifted streets of Pellawa. One of these venturesome wanderers was the little French bagger of the Valley Outfit, Jean Benoit. He had come to Pellawa in the morning and untoward obstructions had kept him from setting out on his return home. He was still "hung up" and was plunging impatiently through the drifts with determination to make a swift wind up of business when he heard a voice down the lane to his right.
<br> 
<br> "You are sure Pullar's away?" came clearly through the storm.
<br> 
<br> "Went in on the morning train with the old man," replied another voice.
<br> 
<br> Jean halted. The mention of Pullar had awakened his curiosity.
<br> 
<br> "I'd hate to run into the Valley boss. He's a bang-up hitter."
<br> 
<br> "No danger. We're squaring with Pullar to-night. He'll never know who pinched his wheat."
<br> 
<br> At this point a mutual laugh came through the darkness.
<br> 
<br> "You meet me with the others at Morrison's bluff. That's the line, eh?"
<br> 
<br> "Righto! We'll slip into Pullar's yard about twelve. So long."
<br> 
<br> There was no more. The men had passed on. Jean lingered. He had not caught the full significance of the brief dialogue, for he could not hear every word and the English troubled him in places. He pieced enough together, however, to conclude that some foul work was meditated against Ned. He held his counsel and rushed through preparations for departure. As he took the South Cut in his descent into the Valley he saw a light in the Grant home. So agitated had he become in his review of the incident in the village that he decided to lay the matter before Charles Grant.
<br> 
<br> The farmer was in bed, but at his knock a light step tripped down the stairs and Margaret opened the door. She invited him in. Grant was promptly aroused and evidenced serious perturbation at Jean's story.
<br> 
<br> "I am afraid there is some devilment afoot," was his comment. "You say there may be a big gang at work?"
<br> 
<br> "Wan, two, tree, four! Mebbe other! I do not know. I tink many."
<br> 
<br> "Can it be an attempt to steal Mr. Pullar's new wheat?" ventured Margaret. "Mary has been telling me so much about it. I saw her to-day. Ned and his father have gone into the City at the call of John T. C. Norrgrene."
<br> 
<br> "It may be that, lass," agreed her father. "Jean's tale points that way."
<br> 
<br> "They are after The Red Knight!" said Margaret with intuitive conviction. "It is a terrible night. What can poor old Dad Blackford do against a gang of daring thieves?"
<br> 
<br> "We'll take a hand in it ourselves," said Grant grimly. "Jean, you take the south trail and let Easy Murphy know. I'll dress and pick up Lawrie and——"
<br> 
<br> "I'll saddle Flash, Dad," interrupted Margaret. "I'm all ready. I can ride over and let Andy know."
<br> 
<br> Grant looked at the girl a second, considering.
<br> 
<br> "Very well, lass! Do it," said her father with a smile. "Ye're good for it and there is not any time to waste. Be careful, for the night is dark."
<br> 
<br> Before her father had reached the stable Margaret was in the saddle and away.
<br> 
<br> Andy was easily aroused and in an incredibly short time was astride Night.
<br> 
<br> "You ride back home," directed he to Margaret. "I'll push Night through. It is half-past eleven and we have four miles to run. I may be in time to scare them off. Your Dad and the others will be right on my heels."
<br> 
<br> With a farewell shout he plunged into the storm. The sound of Night's speeding hoofs smote her ears then died away. Reluctantly she turned Flash for home and trotted off. They had proceeded but a few rods when she reined him in and halted abruptly, loitering irresolute.
<br> 
<br> "Come, Flash! About!" was her sudden command. "We'll be in it, too."
<br> 
<br> Wheeling her mount she sent him at a gallop after Night and his rider.
<br> 
<br> Andy put his horse through at a stiff pace. The homestead was shrouded in blackness as he approached. Riding through the gate he cantered swiftly down the lane, and pulled up beside the house. He had but halted when he discerned the dim movement of figures on all sides of him. With the consciousness of their presence came the realization that they were men.
<br> 
<br> "Good-night, gentlemen!" he called.
<br> 
<br> But there was no reply. Instead he could hear smothered cries of chagrin and savage anger, followed by a rush of the encompassing forms. Night's bridle was seized and strong hands grappled him, dragging him from the saddle. Terrified by the rough handling and mysterious commotion the horse reared and plunged, tearing away from her captors. Leaping free she dashed off down the lane.
<br> 
<br> As Andy came to earth he clutched one of his assailants and they rolled over. In the darkness the others seizing his foeman by mistake wrenched him away, leaving Andy free. Leaping to his feet, he backed to the wall of the house. Discovering their mistake they rushed him again. He struck out and a shadow staggered and fell. They closed in as another went down. Hands seized him on every side. He was struggling mightily, tossing his assailants about, when he heard a voice shrill out above the smothered tumult. He realized that it was Margaret's cry and conscious that help was near, fought with renewed fury to free his arms. Then something crashed upon his head and he tottered back, falling in a heap against the wall.
<br> 
<br> Speeding along on the trail behind, Margaret had not spared her horse. She had slowed up and was peering through the darkness for the gate when Flash swerved violently, almost unseating her. At the same time there dashed past her some fleeing thing. All she caught was the dim shadow of an empty saddle and flying stirrups. She knew it was Night. Thrilled by a foreboding of disaster she charged down the lane. She rode up to the house, halting Flash on his haunches at the group of struggling men. She could hear the heavy breathing and knew that Andy was fighting desperately with his back to the wall. She thought of riding Flash upon them but checked him, fearing she might injure Andy himself. A sense of impotence swept over her. Then flashed into her mind an idea. Rising in her stirrups she shouted:
<br> 
<br> "Father! Men! This way!"
<br> 
<br> Immediately Andy went down, but at the same instant Snoopy Bill and his men were stampeded. Sure that a rescue party was on them they dropped their victim and bolted for the sleighs. Leaping in they whirled their teams about and lashing them to a run fled out of the yard and back over the fields.
<br> 
<br> Ten minutes later when Grant galloped up with the others they found Margaret sitting in the snow with Andy's head upon her lap.
<br> 
<br> "Lassie!" cried the astonished Grant. "You here?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, Father!" was her quiet reply. "I got here too late to save Andy. They've hurt him terribly."
<br> 
<br> "Be easy, lass!" soothed the man, "it may not be sae serious. The lad will be coming round in a meenit."
<br> 
<br> They carried him into the house and laid him upon a couch. A quick examination discovered a gash in the head from some heavy implement.
<br> 
<br> "It is a concussion," said Grant. "But not vera deep. Aye, he is coming out."
<br> 
<br> Andy opened his eyes. The first object he became conscious of was the face of Margaret bending over him. Smiling faintly he observed in surprise:
<br> 
<br> "You here, Margaret? I thought I heard you shout just before they got me."
<br> 
<br> He closed his eyes drowsily.
<br> 
<br> "You sent me home," she whispered in his ear. "But I changed my mind and followed you."
<br> 
<br> When she looked up she discovered that they were alone.
<br> 
<br> "You should not have come," was the gentle reprimand.
<br> 
<br> "Indeed? I think you were very rude to send me away."
<br> 
<br> "But I am glad you are here, now," said he contentedly.
<br> 
<br> "You really are?"
<br> 
<br> "Really."
<br> 
<br> "And so am I," said the girl softly. "Because—because, Andy, that wonderful 'something' has happened. Now I know beyond all doubt that I have always loved you and—I love you now."
<br> 
<br> "Then," said he, drawing her head down to him, "then——"
<br> 
<br> "You may kiss me with a clear conscience, Andy."
<br> 
<br> While Margaret was dispensing her welcome ministrations Grant and his men were going over the buildings. Their swift search found everything intact. Two of the riders who had gone out to the portable granary reported all well there. Not a grain of The Red Knight had been touched. While this was gratifying, the men's faces were exceedingly grave. Nowhere on the premises could they find Dad Blackford. They were beginning to discuss the probability of foul play when Easy Murphy gave a yell.
<br> 
<br> "Hist, ladies and gintlemen!" said he. "Take a look. 'Tis the missing link himsilf, disguised as Santa Clause."
<br> 
<br> They all took a look and there on the porch stood Dad Blackford hatless and dishevelled, with snow-matted beard and a very red and perspiring face. He was blowing like a grampus and looked for all the world like the merry personality of Christmas tide. His eyes were astonished at the sight they met and how they sparkled as they recounted to him the night's adventures. His joy at finding that all was well more than compensated for the shameless treatment he had received at the hands of the artful Sykes.
<br> 
<br> When Margaret got him alone she somewhat surprised him.
<br> 
<br> "Never mind, Dad," she confided. "After all it's been a delightful adventure. Andy got a sore head but it will soon be better. His heart is well again."
<br> 
<br> Dad looked at her a moment dumbfounded. Then he tumbled and the laughter of a merry heart twinkled in his eyes.
<br> 
<br> "Been 'avin' a quarrel with un?" he teased.
<br> 
<br> "No. Just a little misunderstanding," she whispered back.
<br> 
<br> This bit of confidence turned the whole affair into a thing of joy for the kind-hearted old Englishman.
<br> 
<br> While this tête-à-tête was taking place the men were riding down the vandals by the aid of lighted lanterns. The trail was dim to begin with, however, and grew dimmer as they swerved to the west out upon the high prairie. Here it vanished altogether and the party returned. The blackness of the night and the heavily drifting snow enabled Snoopy Bill and his men to make a clean get-away.
<br> 
<br> Following Sykes' plan providing for misadventure they turned into the west instead of the east and recrossed the Valley about the west end of the lake, eventually arriving in the Square Room thoroughly wearied and disgruntled and two hours behind schedule time.
<br> 
<br> Sykes' face was a picture of blank dismay; McClure's of rage.
<br> 
<br> "Where is the squealer?" cried Bob McClure as he stalked among the men.
<br> 
<br> Blasphemous and resentful protestations quite evidently sincere came from all parts of the room.
<br> 
<br> "No, Rob!" said Snoopy Bill deliberately. "You are a liar if you say it. There isn't a squealer in the gang. Not a man laid down. Any squealing that may have taken place was let out by the gents who stayed behind."
<br> 
<br> Reddy Sykes read the savage light in Baird's eyes.
<br> 
<br> "You are straight, Bill," he cried soothingly. "Straight as a die and I know it. The boys came through. But somebody outside got wise. We'll find out and when we do somebody's due to get a blankety unpleasant surprise. The whole thing ran out to dope. We should have that wheat in Hunt's shack. It's Pullar's luck. But it will change. Here's to a lucky break."
<br> 
<br> He held his flask high. The men caught his spirit and responded with a shout. For an hour the crew caroused, drinking heavily as they debated the fiasco, breaking up before dawn.
<br> 
<br> Dad Blackford made a full report to Ned. Though no trace of the perpetrators of the offense had been obtained, his mind flew instantly to his two enemies. The Red Knight had been their objective. The incident was big with warning to him. It assured him of two things: of their malicious, untiring hate; of their dangerous resource. Thoughts of Mary pressed heavily upon him. He remembered her words:
<br> 
<br> "There is no other way. But, Ned, you will have to be right, always, as well as irresistible. I know you will be."
<br> 
<br> "It's a stiff programme, little girl," he reflected ruefully. "But we'll stay with it."
