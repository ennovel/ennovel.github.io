It presents, too, all the features which have hitherto characterised earthquakes in this neighbourhood. These are well worthy of careful study, and appear to have an important bearing on the modern theory of earthquakes.
<br> 
<br> It has been commonly held that the seat of disturbance in the earthquakes which have shaken the country west of the Andes has lain always at some point or other beneath that range of mountains. The fact that several large volcanoes are found in the Cordilleras has seemed confirmatory of this view. The account we have also of the great earthquake at Riobamba in 1797, seems only explicable by supposing that the seat of disturbance lay almost immediately beneath that city. The inhabitants were flung vertically upwards into the air, and to such a height that Humboldt found the skeletons of many of them on the summit of the hill La Culca, on the farther side of the small river on which Riobamba is built. The ruins of many houses were also flung to the same spot. Here, therefore, was evidence of that vertical (or, as Humboldt expresses it, explosive)190 force which is only to be looked for immediately above the centre of concussion.
<br> 
<br> Yet the consideration of the evidence afforded by the news just published seems at first sight somewhat opposed to this view, and to point rather to a seat of disturbance lying considerably to the west of the Peruvian shores. ‘At Chala,’ says our informant, ‘the sea receded, and a wave rose fifty feet, and returned, spreading into the town, a distance of about a thousand feet. Three successive times everything within range was swept away, followed by twelve shocks of earthquake, lasting from three seconds to two minutes.’ The arrival of great sea-waves before the land-shocks were felt, seems decisively to indicate that the seat of disturbance lay beneath the ocean, and not beneath the land. I am disposed to believe, however, that in the confusion of mind naturally resulting from the occurrence of so terrible a catastrophe, the sequence of events may not have been very closely attended to, for in other places the arrival of the great sea-wave is distinctly described as following the occurrence of the earth-shock. At Arica, for example, a considerable interval would seem to have elapsed before the terrible sea-wave, which has always characterised Peruvian earthquakes, poured in upon the town. The agent of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company, whose house had been destroyed by the earth-shock, saw the great sea-wave while he was flying towards the hills. He writes:—’While passing towards the hills, with the earth shaking, a great cry191 went up to heaven. The sea had retired. On clearing the town, I looked back and saw that the vessels were being carried irresistibly seawards. In a few minutes the sea stopped, and then arose a mighty wave fifty feet high, and came in with a fearful rush, carrying everything before it in terrible majesty. The whole of the shipping came back, speeding towards inevitable doom. In a few minutes all was completed—every vessel was either on shore or bottom upwards.’ This, then, was undoubtedly the great sea-wave, as compared with the minor waves of disturbance which characterise all earthquakes near the shores of the ocean.
<br> 
<br> One remarkable feature in this terrible earthquake is the enormous range of country affected by it. From Quito southwards as far as Iquique—or, in other words, for a distance considerably exceeding a full third part of the whole length of the South American Andes—the shock was felt with the most terrible distinctness. We have yet to learn how much farther to the north and south, and how far inland on the eastern slopes of the Andes, the shock was experienced. But there can be little doubt that the disturbed country was equal to at least a fourth of Europe.
<br> 
<br> The portion of the Andes thus disturbed seems to be distinct from the part to which the great Chilian earthquakes belong. The difference in character between the Peruvian and Chilian earthquakes is a singular and interesting phenomenon. The difference corresponds to a feature long since pointed out by Sir Charles Lyell,—the alternation, on a grand scale, of192 districts of active with those of extinct volcanoes. It is said that in Chili a year scarcely ever passes without shocks of earthquake being felt; in certain regions, not even a month. A similar persistence of earthquake-disturbance characterises Peru. Yet, although both districts are shaken in this manner, there seems to be distinct evidence of alternating disturbance as respects the occurrence of great earthquakes. Thus in 1797 took place the terrible earthquake of Riobamba. Then, thirty years later, a series of great earthquakes shook Chili, permanently elevating the whole line of coast to the height of several feet. Now, again, after another interval of about thirty years, the Andes are disturbed by a great earthquake, and this time it is the Peruvian Andes which experience the shock. Between Chili and Peru there is a space upwards of five hundred miles long, in which no volcanic action has been observed. Singularly enough, this very portion of the Andes, to which one would imagine the Peruvians and Chilians would fly as to a region of safety, is the part most thinly inhabited, insomuch that, as Von Buch observes, it is in some places entirely deserted.
<br> 
<br> Near Quito the trembling of the earth is almost incessant, according to M. Boussingault. He considers that the frequency of the movement is due rather to the continual falling in of masses of rock which have been fractured in recent earthquakes, than to the persistence of subterranean action. He adds that the height of several mountains in the Andes has diminished193 in modern times. He refers, doubtless, to the Peruvian and Columbian Andes, and not to the Chilian. In the latter portion of the range there must be a continual increase of height, since each earthquake in Chili has produced a perceptible recession of the sea. Darwin, indeed, relates that near Valparaiso he saw beds of seashells belonging to recent species at a height of about a quarter of a mile above the present sea-level; and he concluded that the land had been raised to this height by a series of such small elevations as were observed to have taken place during the earthquakes of 1822, 1835, and 1837. That a contrary process should be going on in Peru, confirms the idea that a sort of undulatory or balancing motion is taking place—one long stretch of the Cordilleras rising while another is sinking. A tradition prevails among the Indians of Lican that the mountain called L’Altar, or Cassac Urcu—which means ‘the chief’—was once the highest of the sub-equatorial Andes, being higher even than Chimborazo; but, adds the tradition, in the reign of Quainia Abomatha, before the discovery of America, a prodigious eruption took place, which lasted no less than eight years, and brought down the summit of the mountain. M. Boussingault states that the fragments of trachyte which once formed the summit of this celebrated mountain are now spread over the plain. At present Cotopaxi is the loftiest volcano of the Cordilleras, its height being no less than 18,858 feet. No mountain has ever been the seat of such terrible and destructive eruptions as those which have burst forth from Cotopaxi. The intensity194 of the heat which prevails during eruption will be readily gathered from the circumstance that in January 1803 the enormous bed of snow which usually covers the cone of the volcano was dissolved in a single night.
<br> 
<br> It would seem that the Mexican volcanoes also belong to the same region of disturbance. Near the Isthmus of Panama the great Cordillera of the Andes is reduced to the height of about 800 feet, and beyond begins the continuation of the volcanic chain in Central America and Mexico. Nor are the volcanoes of the West Indian or Caribbee Islands wholly disconnected with the region of disturbance in Southern America. And it is rather singular that even the earthquakes which have occurred in the valley of the Mississippi seem to be connected with the West Indian and South American volcanic region. The violent earthquakes which took place at New Madrid in 1812 occurred at exactly the same time as the earthquake of Paranas, ‘so that it is possible,’ says Sir Charles Lyell, ‘that these two points are part of one volcanic region.’
