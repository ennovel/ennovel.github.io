But I believe that when a balance is carefully struck between the good and the evil effects resulting from excessive drought in England, it will be found that the latter largely prevail. In fact, it is only necessary to observe the effects which have followed the recent wet weather to recognise the fact that rain has a forcing power, the very diminished supply of which at the due season cannot fail to have seriously injurious effects. In various parts of England we see evidences of the action of such a power during the present autumn in the blossoming of trees, in the flowering of primroses and other spring plants, in rich growths of fungi, and in various other ways. It cannot be doubted that there is here a comparative waste of powers which, expended in due season, would have produced valuable results.
<br> 
<br> The modern theories of the correlation of force suffice to show how enormous a loss a country suffers226 when there is a failure in the supply of rain, or when that supply comes out of its due season. When we consider rain in connection with the causes to which it is due, we begin to recognise the enormous amount of power of which the ordinary rainfall of a country is the representative; and we can well understand how it is that ‘the clouds drop fatness on the earth.’
<br> 
<br> The sun’s heat is, of course, the main agent—we may almost say the only agent—in supplying the rainfall of a country. The process of evaporation carried on over large portions of the ocean’s surface is continually storing up enormous masses of water in the form of invisible aqueous vapour, ready to be transformed into cloud, then wafted for hundreds of miles across seas and continents, to be finally precipitated over this or that country, according to the conditions which determine the downfall of rain. These processes do not appear, at first sight, indicative of any very great expenditure of force, yet in reality the force-equivalent of the rain-supply of England alone for a single year is something positively startling. It has been calculated that the amount of heat required to evaporate a quantity of water which would cover an area of 100 square miles to a depth of one inch would be equal to the heat which would be produced by the combustion of half a million tons of coals. The amount of force of which this consumption of heat would be the equivalent corresponds to that which would be required to raise a weight of upwards of one thousand millions of tons to a height of one mile. Now, when we remember227 that the area of Great Britain and Ireland is about 120,000 square miles, and that the annual rainfall averages about 25 inches, we see that the force-equivalent of the rainfall is enormous. All the coal which could be raised from our English coal mines in hundreds of years would not give out heat enough to produce England’s rain-supply for a single year. When to this consideration we add the circumstance that the force of rain produces bad as well as good effects—the former when the rain falls at undue seasons or in an irregular manner, the latter only when the rainfall is distributed in the usual manner among the seasons—we see that an important loss accrues to a country in such exceptional years as the present.
<br> 
<br> There are few subjects more interesting than those depending on the correlation of physical forces; and we may add that there are few the study of which bears more largely on questions of agricultural and commercial economy. It is only of late years that the silent forces of nature—forces continually in action, but which are too apt to pass unnoticed and unrecognised—have taken their due place in scientific inquiry. Strangely enough, the subject has been found to have at once a most practical bearing on business relations, and an aspect more strikingly poetical than any other subject, perhaps, which men of science have ever taken in hand to investigate. We see the ordinary processes of Nature, as they are termed, taking their place in the workshop of modern wealth, and at the same time228 exhibited in a hundred striking and interesting physical relations. What, for instance, can be stranger or more poetical than the contrast which Professor Tyndall has instituted between that old friend of the agriculturist—the wintry snow-flake—and the wild scenery of the Alps? ‘I have seen,’ he says, ‘the wild stone-avalanches of the Alps, which smoke and thunder down the declivities with a vehemence almost sufficient to stun the observer. I have also seen snow-flakes descending so softly as not to hurt the fragile spangles of which they were composed; yet to produce from aqueous vapour a quantity which a child could carry of that tender material demands an exertion of energy competent to gather up the shattered blocks of the largest stone-avalanche I have ever seen, and pitch them to twice the height from which they fell.’
<br> 
<br> I may point out in this place the important connection which exists between the rainfall of a country and the amount of forest land. I notice that in parts of America attention is being paid—with markedly good results—to the influence of forests in encouraging rainfall. We have here an instance in which cause and effect are interchangeable. Rain encourages the growth of an abundant vegetation, and abundant vegetation in turn tends to produce a state of the superincumbent atmosphere which encourages the precipitation of rain. The consequence is, that it is very necessary to check, before it is too late, the processes which lead to the gradual destruction of forests. If these processes are continued until the climate has229 become excessively dry, it is almost impossible to remedy the mischief, simply because the want of moisture is destructive to the trees which may be planted to encourage rainfall. Thus there are few processes more difficult (as has been found by experience in parts of Spain and elsewhere) than the change of an arid region into a vegetation-covered district. In fact, if the region is one of great extent, the attempt to effect such a change is a perfectly hopeless one. On the other hand, the contrary process—that is, the attempt to change a climate which is too moist into one of less humidity—is in general not attended with much difficulty. A judicious system of clearing nearly always leads to the desired result.
<br> 
<br> The dryness of the past year has not been due to the want of moisture in the air, nor to the exceptionally unclouded condition of our skies. I believe that, on the whole, the skies have been rather more cloudy than usual this year. The fact that so little dew has fallen is a sufficient proof that the nights have been on the whole more cloudy than usual, since, as is well known, the presence of clouds, by checking the radiation of the earth’s heat, prevents (or at least diminishes) the formation of dew. The fact would seem to be that the westerly and south-westerly winds which usually blow over England during a considerable part of the year, bringing with them large quantities of aqueous vapour from above the great Gulf Stream, have this year blown somewhat higher than usual. Why this should be it is not very easy to say. The height of230 the vapour-laden winds is usually supposed to depend on the heat of the weather. In summer, for instance, the clouds range higher, and therefore travel farther inland before they fall in rain. In winter, on the contrary, they travel low, and hence the rain falls more freely in the western than in the eastern counties during winter. A similar relation prevails in the Scandinavian peninsula—Norway receiving more rain in winter than in summer, while Sweden receives more rain in summer than in winter. But this summer the rain-clouds have blown so much higher than usual as to pass beyond England altogether. Possibly we may find an explanation in the fact that before reaching our shores at all the clouds were relieved by heavy rainfalls—probably due to some exceptional electrical relations—over parts of the Atlantic Ocean. It is stated that the steam-ships from America this summer were, in many instances, drenched by heavy showers until they neared the coasts of England.
