He was walking towards Christminster City, at a point a mile or two to the south-west of it.</p> 
<p>He had at last found himself clear of Marygreen and Alfredston: he was out of his apprenticeship, and with his tools at his back seemed to be in the way of making a new start--the start to which, barring the interruption involved in his intimacy and married experience with Arabella, he had been looking forward for about ten years.</p> 
<p>Jude would now have been described as a young man with a forcible, meditative, and earnest rather than handsome cast of countenance. He was of dark complexion, with dark harmonizing eyes, and he wore a closely trimmed black beard of more advanced growth than is usual at his age; this, with his great mass of black curly hair, was some trouble to him in combing and washing out the stone-dust that settled on it in the pursuit of his trade. His capabilities in the latter, having been acquired in the country, were of an all-round sort, including monumental stone-cutting, gothic free-stone work for the restoration of churches, and carving of a general kind. In London he would probably have become specialized and have made himself a "moulding mason," a "foliage sculptor"-- perhaps a "statuary."</p> 
<p>He had that afternoon driven in a cart from Alfredston to the village nearest the city in this direction, and was now walking the remaining four miles rather from choice than from necessity, having always fancied himself arriving thus.</p> 
<p>The ultimate impulse to come had had a curious origin-- one more nearly related to the emotional side of him than to the intellectual, as is often the case with young men. One day while in lodgings at Alfredston he had gone to Marygreen to see his old aunt, and had observed between the brass candlesticks on her mantlepiece the photograph of a pretty girlish face, in a broad hat with radiating folds under the brim like the rays of a halo. He had asked who she was. His grand-aunt had gruffly replied that she was his cousin Sue Bridehead, of the inimical branch of the family; and on further questioning the old woman had replied that the girl lived in Christminster, though she did not know where, or what she was doing.</p> 
<p>His aunt would not give him the photograph. But it haunted him; and ultimately formed a quickening ingredient in his latent intent of following his friend the school master thither.</p> 
<p>He now paused at the top of a crooked and gentle declivity, and obtained his first near view of the city. Grey-stoned and dun-roofed, it stood within hail of the Wessex border, and almost with the tip of one small toe within it, at the northernmost point of the crinkled line along which the leisurely Thames strokes the fields of that ancient kingdom. The buildings now lay quiet in the sunset, a vane here and there on their many spires and domes giving sparkle to a picture of sober secondary and tertiary hues.</p> 
<p>Reaching the bottom he moved along the level way between pollard willows growing indistinct in the twilight, and soon confronted the outmost lamps of the town--some of those lamps which had sent into the sky the gleam and glory that caught his strained gaze in his days of dreaming, so many years ago. They winked their yellow eyes at him dubiously, and as if, though they had been awaiting him all these years in disappointment at his tarrying, they did not much want him now.</p> 
<p>He was a species of Dick Whittington whose spirit was touched to finer issues than a mere material gain. He went along the outlying streets with the cautious tread of an explorer. He saw nothing of the real city in the suburbs on this side. His first want being a lodging he scrutinized carefully such localities as seemed to offer on inexpensive terms the modest type of accommodation he demanded; and after inquiry took a room in a suburb nicknamed "Beersheba," though he did not know this at the time. Here he installed himself, and having had some tea sallied forth.</p> 
<p>It was a windy, whispering, moonless night. To guide himself he opened under a lamp a map he had brought. The breeze ruffled and fluttered it, but he could see enough to decide on the direction he should take to reach the heart of the place.</p> 
<p>After many turnings he came up to the first ancient mediaeval pile that he had encountered. It was a college, as he could see by the gateway. He entered it, walked round, and penetrated to dark corners which no lamplight reached. Close to this college was another; and a little further on another; and then he began to be encircled as it were with the breath and sentiment of the venerable city. When he passed objects out of harmony with its general expression he allowed his eyes to slip over them as if he did not see them.</p> 
<p>A bell began clanging, and he listened till a hundred-and-one strokes had sounded. He must have made a mis-take, he thought: it was meant for a hundred.</p> 
<p>When the gates were shut, and he could no longer get into the quadrangles, he rambled under the walls and doorways, feeling with his fingers the contours of their mouldings and carving. The minutes passed, fewer and fewer people were visible, and still he serpentined among the shadows, for had he not imagined these scenes through ten bygone years, and what mattered a night's rest for once? High against the black sky the flash of a lamp would show crocketed pinnacles and indented battlements. Down obscure alleys, apparently never trodden now by the foot of man, and whose very existence seemed to be forgotten, there would jut into the path porticoes, oriels, doorways of enriched and florid middle-age design, their extinct air being accentuated by the rottenness of the stones. It seemed impossible that modern thought could house itself in such decrepit and superseded chambers.</p> 
<p>Knowing not a human being here, Jude began to be impressed with the isolation of his own personality, as with a self-spectre, the sensation being that of one who walked but could not make himself seen or heard. He drew his breath pensively, and, seeming thus almost his own ghost, gave his thoughts to the other ghostly presences with which the nooks were haunted.</p> 
<p>During the interval of preparation for this venture, since his wife and furniture's uncompromising disappearance into space, he had read and learnt almost all that could be read and learnt by one in his position, of the worthies who had spent their youth within these reverend walls, and whose souls had haunted them in their maturer age. Some of them, by the accidents of his reading, loomed out in his fancy disproportionately large by comparison with the rest. The brushings of the wind against the angles, buttresses, and door-jambs were as the passing of these only other inhabitants, the tappings of each ivy leaf on its neighbour were as the mutterings of their mournful souls, the shadows as their thin shapes in nervous movement, making him comrades in his solitude. In the gloom it was as if he ran against them without feeling their bodily frames.</p> 
<p>The streets were now deserted, but on account of these things he could not go in. There were poets abroad, of early date and of late, from the friend and eulogist of Shakespeare down to him who has recently passed into silence, and that musical one of the tribe who is still among us. Speculative philosophers drew along, not always with wrinkled foreheads and hoary hair as in framed portraits, but pink-faced, slim, and active as in youth; modern divines sheeted in their surplices, among whom the most real to Jude Fawley were the founders of the religious school called Tractarian; the well-known three, the enthusiast, the poet, and the formularist, the echoes of whose teachings had influenced him even in his obscure home. A start of aversion appeared in his fancy to move them at sight of those other sons of the place, the form in the full-bottomed wig, statesman rake, reasoner and sceptic; the smoothly shaven historian so ironically civil to Christianity; with others of the same incredulous temper, who knew each quad as well as the faithful, and took equal freedom in haunting its cloisters.</p> 
<p>He regarded the statesmen in their various types, men of firmer movement and less dreamy air; the scholar, the speaker, the plodder; the man whose mind grew with his growth in years, and the man whose mind contracted with the same.</p> 
<p>The scientists and philologists followed on in his mind-sight in an odd impossible combination, men of meditative faces, strained foreheads, and weak-eyed as bats with constant research; then official characters--such men as governor-generals and lord-lieutenants, in whom he took little interest; chief-justices and lord chancellors, silent thin-lipped figures of whom he knew barely the names. A keener regard attached to the prelates, by reason of his own former hopes. Of them he had an ample band--some men of heart, others rather men of head; he who apologized for the Church in Latin; the saintly author of the Evening Hymn; and near them the great itinerant preacher, hymn-writer, and zealot, shadowed like Jude by his matrimonial difficulties.</p> 
<p>Jude found himself speaking out loud, holding conversations with them as it were, like an actor in a melodrama who apostrophizes the audience on the other side of the footlights; till he suddenly ceased with a start at his absurdity. Perhaps those incoherent words of the wanderer were heard within the walls by some student or thinker over his lamp; and he may have raised his head, and wondered what voice it was, and what it betokened. Jude now perceived that, so far as solid flesh went, he had the whole aged city to himself with the exception of a belated townsman here and there, and that he seemed to be catching a cold.</p> 
<p>A voice reached him out of the shade; a real and local voice:</p> 
<p>"You've been a-settin' a long time on that plinth-stone, young man. What med you be up to?"</p> 
<p>It came from a policeman who had been observing Jude without the latter observing him.</p> 
<p>Jude went home and to bed, after reading up a little about these men and their several messages to the world from a book or two that he had brought with him concerning the sons of the university. As he drew towards sleep various memorable words of theirs that he had just been conning seemed spoken by them in muttering utterances; some audible, some unintelligible to him. One of the spectres (who afterwards mourned Christminster as "the home of lost causes," though Jude did not remember this) was now apostrophizing her thus:</p> 
<p>"Beautiful city! so venerable, so lovely, so unravaged by the fierce intellectual life of our century, so serene! ... Her ineffable charm keeps ever calling us to the true goal of all of us, to the ideal, to perfection."</p> 
<p>Another voice was that of the Corn Law convert, whose phantom he had just seen in the quadrangle with a great bell. Jude thought his soul might have been shaping the historic words of his master-speech:</p> 
<p>"Sir, I may be wrong, but my impression is that my duty towards a country threatened with famine requires that that which has been the ordinary remedy under all similar circumstances should be resorted to now, namely, that there should be free access to the food of man from whatever quarter it may come.... Deprive me of office to-morrow, you can never deprive me of the consciousness that I have exercised the powers committed to me from no corrupt or interested motives, from no desire to gratify ambition, for no personal gain."</p> 
<p>Then the sly author of the immortal Chapter on Christianity: "How shall we excuse the supine inattention of the Pagan and philosophic world, to those evidences (miracles) which were presented by Omnipotence? ... The sages of Greece and Rome turned aside from the awful spectacle, and appeared unconscious of any alterations in the moral or physical government of the world."</p> 
<p>Then the shade of the poet, the last of the optimists:</p> 
<p>How the world is made for each of us! . . . . . . . . . . . And each of the Many helps to recruit The life of the race by a general plan.</p> 
<p>Then one of the three enthusiasts he had seen just now, the author of the APOLOGIA:</p> 
<p>"My argument was ... that absolute certitude as to the truths of natural theology was the result of an assemblage of concurring and converging probabilities ... that probabilities which did not reach to logical certainty might create a mental certitude."</p> 
<p>The second of them, no polemic, murmured quieter things:</p> 
<p>Why should we faint, and fear to live alone, Since all alone, so Heaven has will'd, we die?</p> 
<p>He likewise heard some phrases spoken by the phantom with the short face, the genial Spectator:</p> 
<p>"When I look upon the tombs of the great, every motion of envy dies in me; when I read the epitaphs of the beautiful, every inordinate desire goes out; when I meet with the grief of parents upon a tombstone, my heart melts with compassion; when I see the tombs of the parents themselves, I consider the vanity of grieving for those whom we must quickly follow."</p> 
<p>And lastly a gentle-voiced prelate spoke, during whose meek, familiar rhyme, endeared to him from earliest childhood, Jude fell asleep:</p> 
<p>Teach me to live, that I may dread The grave as little as my bed. Teach me to die ...</p> 
<p>He did not wake till morning. The ghostly past seemed to have gone, and everything spoke of to-day. He started up in bed, thinking he had overslept himself and then said:</p> 
<p>"By Jove--I had quite forgotten my sweet-faced cousin, and that she's here all the time! ... and my old schoolmaster, too." His words about his schoolmaster had, perhaps, less zest in them than his words concerning his cousin.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>裘德采取了他有生以来的又一次值得注意的行动。在瞑色四合、暮野沉沉中，他迈着矫健而轻快的步子，一往直前。从他最初同阿拉贝拉调情到鄙俗的婚姻生活的最后破裂，其间已三历寒暑。如今又到了枝繁叶茂、绿满人间的时节。他正朝基督堂城走去，到了离城西南面一二英里的地方。</p> 
<p>他同马利格林和阿尔夫瑞顿的缘分终于结束。他已经学徒期满，这会儿背着工具，像是正走在开辟新生活的起点的途程上——不算他同阿拉贝拉两情缱绻和婚姻生活造成的中断，他对这新起点企盼之殷约有十年之久。</p> 
<p>单单形容他这会儿一表人材是不够的，他的神采更其表明他是个刚强自信、好学深思、诚挚严肃的青年。脸上皮色颇深，恰好配上非常合适的黑眼睛；留着修得很齐整的小胡子，而这个年龄的人却很少胡子长得这么冲；黑胡子加上浓密的黑鬈发，做手艺时落上石粉，梳洗起来就很费事了。他在乡下学的石活儿，样样俱全，包括錾各类石碑，修复教堂易切石雕刻，以及一般镌刻。他若是在伦敦，经过努力，大概会专精一门，或当上“造型石匠”，或成为“叶簇雕刻匠”，说不定还做个“雕像师”哩。</p> 
<p>那天下午，他在阿尔夫瑞顿坐上四轮运货小马车，按上边说的方向，到了离基督堂最近的村子，这会儿正在走剩下的四英里路，倒不是因为只好这么走，而是他宁愿走，因为他一直想象着有那么一天步行到基督堂。</p> 
<p>他终于决定到基督堂有个奇怪的诱因，它同情感方面的关系大大超过了同求知方面的关系，而类似情形，年轻人当中说来并不鲜见。原来他住在阿尔夫瑞顿时候，有一天回马利格林看望老姑婆，注意到壁炉搁板上，铜烛台之间，摆着一张面貌眣丽的少女的相片：她戴着宽边帽，帽缘缀着圆褶，宛如圣洁的光环。他问这是谁。姑婆没好气地回他说，是他一个表姊妹苏·柏瑞和，是那个终年不安生的家门的。他再往下问，姑婆说她人是在基督堂，至于住在哪儿，干什么，她一点不知道。</p> 
<p>她不肯把相片给他。不过他心里一直想来想去，这件事终于成了他久已怀着的到基督堂追步他那位老师和朋友的心愿的快速催化剂。</p> 
<p>这会儿他正从一条曲折小径走上那个不算陡的斜坡，到了顶上就停下来。这是他头一回从近处观览基督堂景色。灰石头造的、房顶是深褐色的这座城市，同维塞克斯郡界毗连，人语相闻；在透迄的边界线极北端一点上，它的小小脚尖伸到了郡里，泰晤士河就打那儿从容不迫地流经古代王国的田野。基督堂的建筑物在残照中意态安详，许许多多塔尖和圆顶上都露出风信旗，为一幅本来用简净素雅的第二色调和第三色调绘就的图画涂上了闪光点。</p> 
<p>他下到坡脚，跟着上了条平坦的道路，截梢柳树夹道而立，暮色苍茫，树影渐见模糊。再往前走，他很快就迎面望见城市边缘的路灯，其中有些盏迎着天空，只见光色溶溶，略显淡彩。在那么多年前，在他对基督堂梦想神驰的日子中，它们不是紧紧吸住过他的紧张的凝望吗？不过这会儿它们似乎露出了犹豫不决，对他眨巴着黄眼睛，像是表示它们本来多少年盼望他负发来学，可是屡屡失望，这会儿不怎么想他来了。</p> 
<p>他本属狄克·惠廷顿一流人，他内心为之感动的并非纯属物质方面的满足，而更其是纯粹、美好的事物。他沿着城市外围走下去，步步小心，犹如探测者那样不敢轻忽大意。但是眼前最要紧的事还是先找到落脚地方，于是他留心察看什么地段能向他提供既适合他需要、租金又不高的普通房子。经过一再打听，总算在一个外号 “别是巴”的郊区租到一间屋子，至于这个外号，他当时并不知道。他就在那儿安顿下来，喝了点茶，又出去转了。</p> 
<p>那晚上没月亮，风声飒飒，人语悄悄。他在路灯底下展开了随身带着的地图，想弄清楚怎么走法。风吹得地图忽上忽下，一折一弯，不过他到底尽量弄明白了走哪个方向，才到得了市中心。</p> 
<p>转了好多个弯儿，他总算遇到一座巍峨的中古时代建筑，根据大门判断，是所学院。进去之后，他到处走，甚至深入到路灯照不到的昏暗角落。紧边上还有一所学院；稍远点又是一所；这样他就让古老庄严的城市的气息和情调包围起来，开始有了充实之感。他只要经过跟它整体形象不相谐调的东西，就有意掉开眼光，像是根本没看见它们。</p> 
<p>钟当当响起来，他侧耳细听，一共数了一百零一下，心想大概听错了，准是敲了一百下。</p> 
<p>学院大门都关上了，他别再想进哪个学院的四方院，只好在院墙外面。大门左右转悠，摸摸墙上凸起的线纹和雕饰的外缘。一分钟一分钟过去了，人越来越少，他仍然在重重墙影中流连不已。以往十年他不是一直在憧憬着这会儿的情景吗？就算整夜不眠不休，也不过这么一回，又算得了什么呀？一盏路灯倏地闪亮，在黑暗的天空衬托下，把卷叶雕装饰的哥特式尖塔和锯齿形垛谍映得形容毕呈。那些幽晦的夹道现在显然根本没人踩过一脚，大概也没人想到它们的存在吧，而那些按中古样式设计而又加以充实、增华的圆柱门廊。凸窗和门道却朝窄窄小道挤了进去，它们的败象本就明显，却又因石头久经剥蚀的累累痕迹，更为突出。这类老朽不堪、落伍于时代的高堂深院，竟然有近代思想安家落户，看来怎么可能呢？</p> 
<p>他在这地方一个人也不认识，所以一时生出孑然一身、遗世独立之感，仿佛就剩下他一个魂灵了。这种感觉，大凡在一个人独自走路，没法叫谁瞧见。听见时，就免不了。他觉着难受，不由得透了口气，既然他这会儿跟孤魂差不多了，他就忍不住朝那些隐在深处转悠的游魂琢磨起来。</p> 
<p>自从他妻于远走高飞，还有那些家具，全同他一刀两断，再也不见踪迹之后，他在准备这次大胆行动过程中间，凡他的条件允许下能找来阅读和研究的卓越人物的著作，他无不—一阅读和研究过。他们就是在那令人肃然起敬的高墙之内度过了青年时代，及至老成持重的年纪，他们的心还是眷念故地，依依不舍。读书时，他不期然而遇到了某些人，他们在他的想象中显得比其他人的形象远为鲜明高大。这时夜风掠过屋角、扶壁和门柱，仿佛这些此地仅有的居民飘忽而过；常春藤相叠的叶子窸窣作响，仿佛他们的凄怆的幽灵正隅隅细语；重重阴影仿佛他们的单薄的身形在局促不安地走动，成了他在孤独中的同志。他好像在昏暗中同他们撞个正着，但是摸不着、碰不到他们的实在的形体。</p> 
<p>街头阒寂，而他却因为有了这样的感触，不想回到住所。这儿有古往今来、五湖四海的诗人，从莎士比亚的朋友和榆扬者到晚近弃世、归于沉默的那位人物，还有那位至今健在、在侪辈中以韵律流美而见称的先生。思辨哲学家信步而来，他们可不像装在框子里的肖像那样一概满额皱纹、须发皤然，而是红光满面，高挑身材，行动灵活。现代神学家身穿法衣，最让裘德·福来感到如见其人的莫如号称讲册派的创始人，响当当三位大人物：热心派、诗人、公式派，他们的教诲哪怕在他住过的穷乡僻壤也响起了回应，对他发生过影响。他的幻觉从他们身上陡地一转，一眼瞧见了此地另一类子孙，顿生厌恶之感，其中一个披散着假发，集政治家。浪荡子、善辩者与怀疑派于一身；另一个是脸刮得于干净净的历史家，他对基督教彬彬有礼，其实暗含着讥讽；此外还有跟他们一样的怀疑一切的人物，他们也可以像虔诚的教徒那样，随心所欲地在四方院走廊徜徉。</p> 
<p>他还瞧见形形色色的政治家，他们行事果决，难为幻想所动；还有学问家、演说家、事务主义者；有的人随着年事见长，胸襟益见开阔；有的人在同一境况下，胸襟反渐趋狭隘。</p> 
<p>在他的幻觉的视界中，跟着出现了难得一见的科学家与语言学家古里古怪地混在一起的群落。他们的神态显着不停地深思冥想，脑门上挤满皱纹，视力因成年累月从事研究已经弱似蝙蝠。接下来是殖民地总督和各郡钦差大臣一类官场人物，他对他们毫无兴趣可言；再有就是首席法官和身兼上议院议长的大法官，这伙人嘴唇薄薄的，不爱说话，他也只略知其名而已。由于他一向抱有的志向，他对于高级神职人员倒是观察得分外仔细，这帮子他道得出一大串——有些人仁爱为怀，有些人理智处事。一位用拉丁文写文章为国教辩护；一位是赞美诗《夕颂》的圣人般的写作者；挨着他们的是那位伟大的巡回布道师，赞美诗写作者和热心家，他跟裘德一样深为不如意的婚姻所苦。</p> 
<p>裘德这时候才发觉自己就像跟他们交谈着一样，情不自禁地把心里想的什么全说出来了，这情形类乎一名情节趣剧的演员对着脚灯那边的观众喋喋不休。他一醒悟过来自己够多荒唐，就吓了一跳，立刻刹住不说了。也许有个学院里的学生或思考者正在灯下用功，听见了他这个漫游者的断断续续的话吧，不免抬起头来，奇怪究竟什么人在说话，他说的又是什么意思。裘德这会儿也看出来，除了稀稀落落几个迟归的市民，再没有别的有血有肉的活人，不禁感到这座古老城市成了他一个人的天下，同时觉得自己有点着了凉似的。</p> 
<p>有个声音从暗地里传过来，倒是真正活人的本地口音。</p> 
<p>“小伙子，你呆在柱石那儿老半天啦，你倒是想干啥呀？”</p> 
<p>这是个警察说的，他一直在注意裘德，后者却没瞧见他。</p> 
<p>裘德回家了。他来这儿时候就带来了一两本书，是专讲那个大学的子子孙孙的，睡觉之前翻看了点关于他们生平的记载和几段他们给世人的启示。他迷迷糊糊要睡着的时候，好像刚才默记下来的若干值得一记的语句又由他们自己亲口嘟嘟囔囔说出来了，有听得清楚的，有听起来不好懂的。幽灵之一（他后来痛惜基督堂城“此方土地，大道沦丧”，不过这话裘德想不起来就是了）这会儿大声点着那城市名字说：</p> 
<p>“美丽的城市啊，那样古色古香，那样高雅纯洁，历经我们这个世纪精神生活的激烈纷争，依然那样安然无恙，那样宠辱不惊！……她那无法解释的神奇力量始终号召我们去追求我们大家共有的真正目标，去实现理想，达到尽善尽美的地步。”</p> 
<p>另一个声音发自那位始而拥护、继而反对《谷物法》的政治家，裘德在那个有大钟的四方院见过他的魂灵，当他是一直在推敲他那篇演说里最精彩的有历史意义的字句呢：</p> 
<p>“议长阁下，我也许错了，但是我的立场是：在国家遭受饥荒威胁的时刻，我责无旁贷，要求现在必须采取在任何类似情况下通常要采取的救济手段，也就是让任何人从任何可能的途径自由取得粮食……你们明天就解除我的职务好了，可是你们绝对剥夺不了我的信念：我行使赋予我的权力，决不是出自邪恶的或者私利的动机，决不是出自实现个人野心的欲望，决不为了取得个人的好处。”</p> 
<p>接下来是在书里写下不朽的《基督教》篇章的那位不动声色。意在言外的作者：“异教徒和哲学家对万能的上帝展示的种种证据（奇迹）漠然视之，采取不闻不问的态度，我们该怎样为他们开脱。……希腊罗马的往哲先贤对于警世奇迹不予理睬，看来应归之于他们对统驭精神和物质的权威力量的变化、更迭，懵懂无知。”</p> 
<p>随后是一位诗人的幽灵，他是最后一位乐观主义者：</p> 
<p>世界就是这样为我们构成！</p> 
<p>……</p> 
<p>众庶悉应依照计划总体</p> 
<p>不惜为充实人类的延续效力。</p> 
<p>下面是他刚见过的三位热心派之一，也就是《为我一生而辩》的作者：</p> 
<p>“我的观点是……自然神学的真理所以具有绝对可信性是多方同时存在的或然性趋同归一的总结果……或然性固然没达到必然性，但可以给思想导出实际可信性。”</p> 
<p>第二位热心派不喜欢辩论，他嘟嘟囔囔地说出些不怎么引人注意的话：</p> 
<p>我们何必为独个儿活着怕得心惊胆战，</p> 
<p>既然上苍的旨意，只好独个儿死了算？</p> 
<p>他也听见那位生来洼心脸的幽灵，和蔼可亲的“旁观者”说出来的几句：</p> 
<p>“我一见伟大人物独瘗墓中，所有妒羡之心顿时化为乌有；我一见红粉佳人的墓志题名，所有淫邪之念不禁瓦解冰消；我一见为人父母者在墓碑旁哀哀欲绝，就感同身受，不胜同情；我一见父母的坟墓，就思量为我们必将很快随之而去的人痛哭流涕之为虚妄。”</p> 
<p>最后那位声音和悦的主教开口了，裘德在孩提时期就听惯了那些柔婉的调子，感到非常亲切，听着听着就酣然入睡了：</p> 
<p>教我怎么活，我就不怕</p> 
<p>把坟墓当成我的床。</p> 
<p>教我怎么死……</p> 
<p>他一觉睡到大天光，夜来出没的鬼魂已悄然离去，明明白白又是一天了。他一骨碌从床上坐起来，心想怎么睡过了头呢，跟着就说：</p> 
<p>“哎呀呀——我倒把个甜脸蛋的表姊妹忘得一千二净啦，她倒是无时无刻不在这儿啊！还有从前的老师，他也在这儿呀。”不过他提到老师的口气大概不像提到表妹时那么饱含着热情。</p>
