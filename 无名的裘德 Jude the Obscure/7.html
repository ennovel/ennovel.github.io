It was fine, warm, and soft summer weather, and he walked with his tools at his back, his little chisels clinking faintly against the larger ones in his basket. It being the end of the week he had left work early, and had come out of the town by a round-about route which he did not usually frequent, having promised to call at a flour-mill near Cresscombe to execute a commission for his aunt.</p> 
<p>He was in an enthusiastic mood. He seemed to see his way to living comfortably in Christminster in the course of a year or two, and knocking at the doors of one of those strongholds of learning of which he had dreamed so much. He might, of course, have gone there now, in some capacity or other, but he preferred to enter the city with a little more assurance as to means than he could be said to feel at present. A warm self-content suffused him when he considered what he had already done. Now and then as he went along he turned to face the peeps of country on either side of him. But he hardly saw them; the act was an automatic repetition of what he had been accustomed to do when less occupied; and the one matter which really engaged him was the mental estimate of his progress thus far.</p> 
<p>"I have acquired quite an average student's power to read the common ancient classics, Latin in particular." This was true, Jude possessing a facility in that language which enabled him with great ease to himself to beguile his lonely walks by imaginary conversations therein.</p> 
<p>"I have read two books of the ILIAD, besides being pretty familiar with passages such as the speech of Phoenix in the ninth book, the fight of Hector and Ajax in the fourteenth, the appearance of Achilles unarmed and his heavenly armour in the eighteenth, and the funeral games in the twenty-third. I have also done some Hesiod, a little scrap of Thucydides, and a lot of the Greek Testament.... I wish there was only one dialect all the same.</p> 
<p>"I have done some mathematics, including the first six and the eleventh and twelfth books of Euclid; and algebra as far as simple equations.</p> 
<p>"I know something of the Fathers, and something of Roman and English history.</p> 
<p>"These things are only a beginning. But I shall not make much farther advance here, from the difficulty of getting books. Hence I must next concentrate all my energies on settling in Christminster. Once there I shall so advance, with the assistance I shall there get, that my present knowledge will appear to me but as childish ignorance. I must save money, and I will; and one of those colleges shall open its doors to me--shall welcome whom now it would spurn, if I wait twenty years for the welcome.</p> 
<p>"I'll be D.D. before I have done!"</p> 
<p>And then he continued to dream, and thought he might become even a bishop by leading a pure, energetic, wise, Christian life. And what an example he would set! If his income were 5000 pounds a year, he would give away 4500 pounds in one form and another, and live sumptuously (for him) on the remainder. Well, on second thoughts, a bishop was absurd. He would draw the line at an archdeacon. Perhaps a man could be as good and as learned and as useful in the capacity of archdeacon as in that of bishop. Yet he thought of the bishop again.</p> 
<p>"Meanwhile I will read, as soon as I am settled in Christminster, the books I have not been able to get hold of here: Livy, Tacitus, Herodotus, AEschylus, Sophocles, Aristophanes--"</p> 
<p>"Ha, ha, ha! Hoity-toity!" The sounds were expressed in light voices on the other side of the hedge, but he did not notice them. His thoughts went on:</p> 
<p>"--Euripides, Plato, Aristotle, Lucretius, Epictetus, Seneca, Antoninus. Then I must master other things: the Fathers thoroughly; Bede and ecclesiastical history generally; a smattering of Hebrew-- I only know the letters as yet--"</p> 
<p>"Hoity-toity!"</p> 
<p>"--but I can work hard. I have staying power in abundance, thank God! and it is that which tells.... Yes, Christminster shall be my Alma Mater; and I'll be her beloved son, in whom she shall be well pleased."</p> 
<p>In his deep concentration on these transactions of the future Jude's walk had slackened, and he was now standing quite still, looking at the ground as though the future were thrown thereon by a magic lantern. On a sudden something smacked him sharply in the ear, and he became aware that a soft cold substance had been flung at him, and had fallen at his feet.</p> 
<p>A glance told him what it was--a piece of flesh, the characteristic part of a barrow-pig, which the countrymen used for greasing their boots, as it was useless for any other purpose. Pigs were rather plentiful hereabout, being bred and fattened in large numbers in certain parts of North Wessex.</p> 
<p>On the other side of the hedge was a stream, whence, as he now for the first time realized, had come the slight sounds of voices and laughter that had mingled with his dreams. He mounted the bank and looked over the fence. On the further side of the stream stood a small homestead, having a garden and pig-sties attached; in front of it, beside the brook, three young women were kneeling, with buckets and platters beside them containing heaps of pigs' chitterlings, which they were washing in the running water. One or two pairs of eyes slyly glanced up, and perceiving that his attention had at last been attracted, and that he was watching them, they braced themselves for inspection by putting their mouths demurely into shape and recommencing their rinsing operations with assiduity.</p> 
<p>"Thank you!" said Jude severely.</p> 
<p>"I DIDN'T throw it, I tell you!" asserted one girl to her neighbour, as if unconscious of the young man's presence.</p> 
<p>"Nor I," the second answered.</p> 
<p>"Oh, Anny, how can you!" said the third.</p> 
<p>"If I had thrown anything at all, it shouldn't have been THAT!"</p> 
<p>"Pooh! I don't care for him!" And they laughed and continued their work, without looking up, still ostentatiously accusing each other.</p> 
<p>Jude grew sarcastic as he wiped his face, and caught their remarks.</p> 
<p>"YOU didn't do it--oh no!" he said to the up-stream one of the three.</p> 
<p>She whom he addressed was a fine dark-eyed girl, not exactly handsome, but capable of passing as such at a little distance, despite some coarseness of skin and fibre. She had a round and prominent bosom, full lips, perfect teeth, and the rich complexion of a Cochin hen's egg. She was a complete and substantial female animal--no more, no less; and Jude was almost certain that to her was attributable the enterprise of attracting his attention from dreams of the humaner letters to what was simmering in the minds around him.</p> 
<p>"That you'll never be told," said she deedily.</p> 
<p>"Whoever did it was wasteful of other people's property."</p> 
<p>"Oh, that's nothing."</p> 
<p>"But you want to speak to me, I suppose?"</p> 
<p>"Oh yes; if you like to."</p> 
<p>"Shall I clamber across, or will you come to the plank above here?"</p> 
<p>Perhaps she foresaw an opportunity; for somehow or other the eyes of the brown girl rested in his own when he had said the words, and there was a momentary flash of intelligence, a dumb announcement of affinity IN POSSE between herself and him, which, so far as Jude Fawley was concerned, had no sort of premeditation in it. She saw that he had singled her out from the three, as a woman is singled out in such cases, for no reasoned purpose of further acquaintance, but in commonplace obedience to conjunctive orders from headquarters, unconsciously received by unfortunate men when the last intention of their lives is to be occupied with the feminine.</p> 
<p>Springing to her feet, she said: "Bring back what is lying there."</p> 
<p>Jude was now aware that no message on any matter connected with her father's business had prompted her signal to him. He set down his basket of tools, picked up the scrap of offal, beat a pathway for himself with his stick, and got over the hedge. They walked in parallel lines, one on each bank of the stream, towards the small plank bridge. As the girl drew nearer to it, she gave without Jude perceiving it, an adroit little suck to the interior of each of her cheeks in succession, by which curious and original manoeuvre she brought as by magic upon its smooth and rotund surface a perfect dimple, which she was able to retain there as long as she continued to smile. This production of dimples at will was a not unknown operation, which many attempted, but only a few succeeded in accomplishing.</p> 
<p>They met in the middle of the plank, and Jude, tossing back her missile, seemed to expect her to explain why she had audaciously stopped him by this novel artillery instead of by hailing him.</p> 
<p>But she, slyly looking in another direction, swayed herself backwards and forwards on her hand as it clutched the rail of the bridge; till, moved by amatory curiosity, she turned her eyes critically upon him.</p> 
<p>"You don't think I would shy things at you?"</p> 
<p>"Oh no."</p> 
<p>"We are doing this for my father, who naturally doesn't want anything thrown away. He makes that into dubbin." She nodded towards the fragment on the grass.</p> 
<p>"What made either of the others throw it, I wonder?" Jude asked, politely accepting her assertion, though he had very large doubts as to its truth.</p> 
<p>"Impudence. Don't tell folk it was I, mind!"</p> 
<p>"How can I? I don't know your name."</p> 
<p>"Ah, no. Shall I tell it to you?"</p> 
<p>"Do!"</p> 
<p>"Arabella Donn. I'm living here."</p> 
<p>"I must have known it if I had often come this way. But I mostly go straight along the high-road."</p> 
<p>"My father is a pig-breeder, and these girls are helping me wash the innerds for black-puddings and such like."</p> 
<p>They talked a little more and a little more, as they stood regarding each other and leaning against the hand-rail of the bridge. The unvoiced call of woman to man, which was uttered very distinctly by Arabella's personality, held Jude to the spot against his intention-- almost against his will, and in a way new to his experience. It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that till this moment Jude had never looked at a woman to consider her as such, but had vaguely regarded the sex as beings outside his life and purposes. He gazed from her eyes to her mouth, thence to her bosom, and to her full round naked arms, wet, mottled with the chill of the water, and firm as marble.</p> 
<p>"What a nice-looking girl you are!" he murmured, though the words had not been necessary to express his sense of her magnetism.</p> 
<p>"Ah, you should see me Sundays!" she said piquantly.</p> 
<p>"I don't suppose I could?" he answered</p> 
<p>"That's for you to think on. There's nobody after me just now, though there med be in a week or two." She had spoken this without a smile, and the dimples disappeared.</p> 
<p>Jude felt himself drifting strangely, but could not help it. "Will you let me?"</p> 
<p>"I don't mind."</p> 
<p>By this time she had managed to get back one dimple by turning her face aside for a moment and repeating the odd little sucking operation before mentioned, Jude being still unconscious of more than a general impression of her appearance. "Next Sunday?" he hazarded. "To-morrow, that is?"</p> 
<p>"Yes."</p> 
<p>"Shall I call?"</p> 
<p>"Yes."</p> 
<p>She brightened with a little glow of triumph, swept him almost tenderly with her eyes in turning, and retracing her steps down the brookside grass rejoined her companions.</p> 
<p>Jude Fawley shouldered his tool-basket and resumed his lonely way, filled with an ardour at which he mentally stood at gaze. He had just inhaled a single breath from a new atmosphere, which had evidently been hanging round him everywhere he went, for he knew not how long, but had somehow been divided from his actual breathing as by a sheet of glass. The intentions as to reading, working, and learning, which he had so precisely formulated only a few minutes earlier, were suffering a curious collapse into a corner, he knew not how.</p> 
<p>"Well, it's only a bit of fun," he said to himself, faintly conscious that to common sense there was something lacking, and still more obviously something redundant in the nature of this girl who had drawn him to her which made it necessary that he should assert mere sportiveness on his part as his reason in seeking her-- something in her quite antipathetic to that side of him which had been occupied with literary study and the magnificent Christminster dream. It had been no vestal who chose THAT missile for opening her attack on him. He saw this with his intellectual eye, just for a short; fleeting while, as by the light of a falling lamp one might momentarily see an inscription on a wall before being enshrouded in darkness. And then this passing discriminative power was withdrawn, and Jude was lost to all conditions of things in the advent of a fresh and wild pleasure, that of having found a new channel for emotional interest hitherto unsuspected, though it had lain close beside him. He was to meet this enkindling one of the other sex on the following Sunday.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile the girl had joined her companions, and she silently resumed her flicking and sousing of the chitterlings in the pellucid stream.</p> 
<p>"Catched un, my dear?" laconically asked the girl called Anny.</p> 
<p>"I don't know. I wish I had thrown something else than that!" regretfully murmured Arabella.</p> 
<p>"Lord! he's nobody, though you med think so. He used to drive old Drusilla Fawley's bread-cart out at Marygreen, till he 'prenticed himself at Alfredston. Since then he's been very stuck up, and always reading. He wants to be a scholar, they say."</p> 
<p>"Oh, I don't care what he is, or anything about 'n. Don't you think it, my child!"</p> 
<p>"Oh, don't ye! You needn't try to deceive us! What did you stay talking to him for, if you didn't want un? Whether you do or whether you don't, he's as simple as a child. I could see it as you courted on the bridge, when he looked at 'ee as if he had never seen a woman before in his born days. Well, he's to be had by any woman who can get him to care for her a bit, if she likes to set herself to catch him the right way."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>在他的生活值得纪念的这段日子中间，有个礼拜六下午，四点钟光景，他从阿尔夫瑞顿回马利格林。长夏中间此时正值天气晴好、温煦、轻柔，他背着工具篓子走路，大小凿子相互撞击，叮叮作响。因为是周末，他下工早，绕道出了镇子。这条路他平时不大走，这回是奉姑婆之命，前往水芹峪附近的磨坊替她办件事。</p> 
<p>他心花怒放。他仿佛看到一两年后通向基督堂的安适稳定的生活，敲响那儿一座他梦寐以求的学术堡垒大门的道路已经在望。眼下他当然也可以凭某种身份到那儿去。但是他宁可等到他手头宽裕到可以使他信心更足的时候再走进那座城市。一想到他到现在达到的成就，他心里暖烘烘的，感到浑身发热。走着走着，他不时左瞧瞧，右望望，像要弄清楚路旁篱外乡下什么景况；不过他实际上没看到什么，因为这只是他不忙时候养成的走路习惯，这会儿又重复一回罢了。他真正念念不忘的是怎样评价他在学习方面的进步。</p> 
<p>“我现在已经具备普通学生阅读一般古典作品的能力了，特别是拉丁文写的。”确实不错，裘德运用这种语言已经达到相当纯熟的程度，每当一个人走路的时候，为了解闷，就用这种语言流利自如地进行想象中的对话。</p> 
<p>“《伊利亚德》好多段落，我已经很熟啦，像第九卷里头菲尼克斯的演说词。第十四卷里头赫克特同阿贾克斯的对战、第十八卷里头阿喀琉斯没有披挂就上阵和上苍赐给他甲胄。第二十三卷里葬礼上竞技的场面，在这些之外，我还念了整整两卷呢。我对赫西奥德下过些工夫，修昔底得斯的东西也略有所知了；希腊文《新约》学了好多，……我倒希望希腊文就一种方言才好咧。</p> 
<p>“我也学了点数学，包括欧几里德的前声卷。第十一、十二卷；代数学到一次方程式。</p> 
<p>“神父文集也略有所窥，还多少知道点罗马史和英国史。</p> 
<p>“这些东西还只能算开了个头。在这地方搞书这么难，我不会再有很大进步啦。所以我一定得集中所有精力，想尽办法进基督堂才行啊。一住到那儿，凭着我能得到的指教，我就会进步得非常之快，再一比，我现在这么点知识，简直就是幼稚无知啦。我一定要存钱，非存不可。总会有一所学院对我敞开大门吧——会欢迎我这个它这会儿不屑一顾的人吧，为这个欢迎，哪怕等上二十年，我也干啊。</p> 
<p>“我不当上神学博士，决不罢休。”</p> 
<p>于是他把梦接着做下去，想着他怎么过一种纯洁无瑕、精力焕发、贤明谨慎的生活，后来居然当上了主教。他将要给世人树立何等了不起的榜样啊！如果他每年进项是五千英镑，他将通过不同方式捐出四千五百镑，剩下的（归自己）过豪华的生活。可是他转念一想，又觉着想当主教，未免太不自量了。他还是把自己定位在副主教席位上为好。也许在副主教任上，他也能跟主教一样仁爱为怀、博学强识、益世济人呢。不过他想过来想过去，又回到当主教上来了。</p> 
<p>“一在基督堂住定了，我就要念在这儿没法搞到的书：李维、塔西陀、希罗多得斯。埃斯库洛斯、索福克勒斯、阿里斯多芬——’</p> 
<p>“哈，哈，哈，别装熊啦！”这是从树篱另一面传出来的很小的说话声音，但是他没理会，继续往下想：</p> 
<p>“——欧里庇得斯、柏拉图、亚里士多德、卢克莱修、埃皮克泰土斯、塞尼加。安托尼奴斯。然后要透彻了解别的著作，要熟读神父文集，要通晓比德和教会史，要懂点希伯来文——我到现在才认得几个字母——”</p> 
<p>“别装熊啦！”</p> 
<p>“不过我能下苦功夫。感谢上帝啊，我生来就有换而不舍的精神，取之不尽的力量。是啊，正是这样的精神和力量告诉我，基督堂必将成为我的母校，我必将是她的爱子，她必将对我满心钟爱、提携扶抱啊！”</p> 
<p>裘德这样深思冥想着自己前程上的种种变化，不知不觉地脚步就放慢了，随后屏息而立，一动不动，目注地面，仿佛那儿有盏神灯大放光芒，照亮了他的“前途”。突然什么东西一下子猛打在他耳朵上，他人这才明白过来，原来一块又软又凉的东西打中了他，落在他脚跟前。</p> 
<p>他一眼就瞧出来是什么玩意儿——一块肉，是闹猪身上那个形状独特的部分，乡下人用这玩意儿给靴子上油，此外它毫无用处。猪在这一带随处可见，因为北维塞克斯一些地区大量饲养肥猪。</p> 
<p>树篱另一面是条小河，他这才头一回弄明白，搅了他梦想的轻微的说话声和笑声原来是从那边传过来的。他上了土坡，从树篱上望过去。小河更前方一点有户农家宅院，连着菜园和猪圈；它前面，河边上，有三个年轻女人跪在那儿，在水流里淘洗身边水桶和大盘子里盛着的猪下水。一对或者两对眼睛羞答答地往上瞄了一下，明白他的注意力已经被吸引过来了，而且他正盯着她们看呢，于是她们把嘴撅起来，装腔作势，一本正经地卖劲儿干那淘洗活儿。</p> 
<p>“多谢大伙啦！”裘德气冲冲地说。</p> 
<p>“跟你说，我可没扔哪！”一个姑娘对她旁边的姑娘声辩着，样子像没觉着有个年轻男人在那边。</p> 
<p>“我也没扔。”第二个回答。</p> 
<p>“哦，安妮，你敢这么说吗！”第三个说。</p> 
<p>“我要是真扔什么，也不会是那玩意儿。”</p> 
<p>“呸！我才不把他放眼里呢！”接着她们大笑起来，再没抬头看，还装模作样你说我，我顶你的。</p> 
<p>裘德抹了抹脸，想好好挖苦挖苦她们，就接过她们的话碴儿：</p> 
<p>“你没扔它——你可真没哟，才怪哪！”他朝上水一点的那个</p> 
<p>他冲着说话的是个黑眼珠姑娘，体态丰盈，模样说不上标致，不过在不算远的距离看上去，也算有几分姿色，只是皮肤有点粗，样儿也透着俗气。她的乳房浑圆凸起，双唇饱满，牙齿齐整，脸色红润鲜活，赛似交趾母鸡下的蛋，活脱是条结实向感的母大虫——真算得毫厘不差！裘德几乎肯定了，把他耽于高尚学问的注意力引到她们的内心骚动那边去的，准是她一手干的勾当。</p> 
<p>“这你休想知道。”她正儿八经地说。</p> 
<p>“谁这么于，谁就是糟蹋别人的东西！”</p> 
<p>“哎，那没关系。”</p> 
<p>“我猜你这是想跟我聊聊吧？”</p> 
<p>“对啦，你要是愿意就行嘛。”</p> 
<p>“是我过河，还是你上板桥这边儿来？”</p> 
<p>大概她料到机会来了。反正这肤色有点深的姑娘在他说话时候死盯住他眼睛不放。一时间，两个人眉来眼去，怕的是，心曲正相通，只在不言中。这样的事，裘德素来不闻不问，自然他丝毫不会事先考虑到这里边的含义。而她呢，也看出来他把她从三个人里头挑出来，无非跟类似情况下挑出个女人一样，这里边根本说不上什么深思熟虑过要做番深交的打算；毛病就出在不幸的男人们非意识地对指挥部发下的号令一贯是无不听命，又恰在他们千不该万不该动了心，同娘儿们打交道的时候，这样的本能发生了作用。</p> 
<p>她霍地站起来，说，“把掉在那边儿的东西拣回来吧。”</p> 
<p>裘德心里明白，不论她父亲生意怎么样，总没什么道理鼓励她跟他套近乎。他放下篓子，拣起那块猪下脚，拿棍子拨开树篱，穿过去。两个人在河两边并排朝板桥走。姑娘到离板桥不远的地方，乘裘德没瞧见，一连着把脸颊巧妙地往里咋，她用这奇特而独到的手法，变戏法似地，在圆胖脸上弄出个地地道道的酒涡。她只要一直不停地笑下去，就能把酒涡保持不变。这造酒涡的功夫并非稀见少有，很多人都试过，不过成了功的只有极少的人。</p> 
<p>他们在桥当中碰到一块儿。裘德把她的飞弹扔给她，似乎有意让她解释解释，她干吗不干脆跟他打招呼，一定用这样新奇的炮火拦截他。</p> 
<p>她羞答答地朝另外的方向看，手抓住桥栏杆，身子前仰后合地摇着；到得后来，春情荡漾勾起来的好奇心，逼她转过目光，上上下下打量他。</p> 
<p>“你不会想是我故意砸你，闹着玩儿吧？”</p> 
<p>“没有，没有。”</p> 
<p>“我们正给爸爸干活儿哪。他当然不愿意把什么丢了。他拿这玩意儿当油擦子。”</p> 
<p>“我就不明白她们哪个干吗这么干？”裘德问她，挺客气地同意了她的说法，尽管他对她这说法的真实性大有怀疑。</p> 
<p>“不要脸呗。你可千万别跟人说我砸的！”</p> 
<p>“我怎么会呢。我还不知道你叫什么哪。”</p> 
<p>“哦，是呀。要我告诉你吗？”</p> 
<p>“要！”</p> 
<p>“阿拉贝拉·邓恩。我就住这儿。”</p> 
<p>“要是我平常走这条路，我自然认得这儿啦。不过我大都是顺大路一直走。”</p> 
<p>“我爸爸是个养猪户。那两个女孩儿帮我洗内脏，做黑香肠什么的。”</p> 
<p>他们靠着栏杆站着，你瞧我，我瞧你，谈谈歇歇，歇歇谈谈；女人对男人那种不出声的诱惑，在阿拉贝拉的整个品性和容色上淋漓尽致地展现出来，把裘德迷得动弹不得，这可反乎他一向的意愿——简直是违背他的意志，而这一套他从前根本没有经历过啊。直到这一刻，裘德压根儿没仔细看过女人，没有像对她那样端洋过谯，他以前模模糊糊地感到性什么的跟他的生活和志趣搭不上边儿，这样说决不是张大其词，他目不转睛地从她的眼睛看判她的双唇，再看她的乳房，又看她的裸露的圆滚滚的胳臂，带着水，湿淋淋的，水花一凉，显得皮肤红红白白，结实得犹如大理石一般。</p> 
<p>“你真是个美人哟！”他自言自语地说，虽然根本用不着说这话来表示他感受到她的磁力。</p> 
<p>“哦！你该到礼拜天看我，那才好呢！”她调皮地说。</p> 
<p>“我没说我不行吧？”他答道。</p> 
<p>“那就由你自个儿想喽。这阵子还没人追我哪。可过一两个礼拜说不定就有啦。”她说这话，不带一点笑容，酒涡也就没了。</p> 
<p>裘德觉着怪得狠，自己一阵子晕晕惚惚的样子，虽然他力求镇定，还是不由自主。</p> 
<p>“你让我追吗？”</p> 
<p>“我才无所谓呢。”</p> 
<p>这时候，她把脸掉到旁边一阵子，来个故伎重演，轻轻地而又古怪地在颊上咋出一个酒涡。而裘德这方面对她的容貌仍然只有个大概印象罢了。“那就明儿喽？”</p> 
<p>“行啊。”</p> 
<p>“我去找你吗？”</p> 
<p>“当然。”</p> 
<p>这小小得手使她喜上眉梢，转身时回眸一顾，俨然若不胜情之态，跟着她就顺着河畔草地回到同伴那儿去了。</p> 
<p>裘德·福来把篓子背好，依然一个人走他的路，热情高涨，激动不已，可是他同时又有了茫然不解之感。他刚好对着新鲜大气猛吸了一口，以前他随便到哪儿，大气总是前后左右包着他，至于有多久，他没在意过，不过这会儿真正一呼吸大气，觉着有点让一层玻璃给挡住了。仅仅几分钟前他那么精心制订的读书、工作和做学问的计划，现在正意想不到地要垮掉，眼看要灰飞烟灭，可是他一点没知觉。</p> 
<p>“哎，这不过闹着玩儿吧。”他心里这么想着，稍微有点意识到，那个向他卖弄风情的姑娘的品格，按常理看，似乎少了点什么，可更其明显的倒是又多了点什么，这一来他只好用解嘲的办法，把找她的理由说成是不过闹着玩就是了——殊不知她身上这一少一多，对于他全心全意致力于文学研究和到基督堂的远大理想的实现，是冰炭不相容的。她选择那样一个飞弹对他展开进攻，就足以说明她决不是给女灶神奉役的贞洁处女。以他那样心明眼亮，他分明有所觉察，但这只是一刹那而已，好比一个人借着将要熄灭的烛光，看那正被黑暗吞没的墙上铭文，只能瞬间一瞥而已。本来就短暂的分辨力悄然而逝了，因而当从未品味过的纵情放荡的欢乐逼临面前时，裘德懵懵然，对事物的真假、美丑、善恶、正邪再也无从判断，却发现了从未料到的宣泄情感的通路，虽然它一向就近在身边。他要在随后那个礼拜天跟那个挑动他的欲念的异性见面。</p> 
<p>同时，那姑娘回到了同伴一块儿，一声不响地在清澈水流中拍打、淘洗猪肠子。</p> 
<p>“弄上钩儿啦，亲爱的？”叫安妮的姑娘直截了当地问。</p> 
<p>“我也不知道啊。我倒想呢，要是起先没丢那个玩意儿，丢个别的倒好啦。”阿拉贝拉有点后悔地嘟囔着。</p> 
<p>“老天爷！他算老几呀，你可别这么想呀。他先前在马利格林给多喜·福来赶车送面包，后来到阿尔夫瑞顿学徒去啦，一直呆在那儿，老是念书念不完，人家说他想当文人呢。”</p> 
<p>“哎，他是老几，是怎么回子事儿，我才不在乎呢。你别当我在乎，小宝贝儿呀！”</p> 
<p>“哎，算了吧，你用不着遮掩，诳我们哟！要是你没想打他主意，那干吗在那儿跟他聊呀聊的。你干也好，不干也好，反正他就跟个小孩儿一样不懂事儿。你在桥上吊他时候，我就看出来啦，那会于他瞧着你，就跟一辈子没见过女人一样。是喽，哪个女人要是豁出去，用个合适办法把他弄上手，能讨他喜欢，管保他一辈子算她的啦。”</p>
