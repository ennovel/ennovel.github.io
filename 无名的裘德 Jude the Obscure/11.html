<p>The night had seemed strangely silent. Jude looked out of the window long before dawn, and perceived that the ground was covered with snow-- snow rather deep for the season, it seemed, a few flakes still falling.</p> 
<p>"I'm afraid the pig-killer won't be able to come," he said to Arabella.</p> 
<p>"Oh, he'll come. You must get up and make the water hot, if you want Challow to scald him. Though I like singeing best."</p> 
<p>"I'll get up," said Jude. "I like the way of my own county."</p> 
<p>He went downstairs, lit the fire under the copper, and began feeding it with bean-stalks, all the time without a candle, the blaze flinging a cheerful shine into the room; though for him the sense of cheerfulness was lessened by thoughts on the reason of that blaze--to heat water to scald the bristles from the body of an animal that as yet lived, and whose voice could be continually heard from a corner of the garden. At half-past six, the time of appointment with the butcher, the water boiled, and Jude's wife came downstairs.</p> 
<p>"Is Challow come?" she asked.</p> 
<p>"No."</p> 
<p>They waited, and it grew lighter, with the dreary light of a snowy dawn. She went out, gazed along the road, and returning said, "He's not coming. Drunk last night, I expect. The snow is not enough to hinder him, surely!"</p> 
<p>"Then we must put it off. It is only the water boiled for nothing. The snow may be deep in the valley."</p> 
<p>"Can't be put off. There's no more victuals for the pig. He ate the last mixing o' barleymeal yesterday morning."</p> 
<p>"Yesterday morning? What has he lived on since?"</p> 
<p>"Nothing."</p> 
<p>"What--he has been starving?"</p> 
<p>"Yes. We always do it the last day or two, to save bother with the innerds. What ignorance, not to know that!"</p> 
<p>"That accounts for his crying so. Poor creature!"</p> 
<p>"Well--you must do the sticking--there's no help for it. I'll show you how. Or I'll do it myself--I think I could. Though as it is such a big pig I had rather Challow had done it. However, his basket o' knives and things have been already sent on here, and we can use 'em."</p> 
<p>"Of course you shan't do it," said Jude. "I'll do it, since it must be done."</p> 
<p>He went out to the sty, shovelled away the snow for the space of a couple of yards or more, and placed the stool in front, with the knives and ropes at hand. A robin peered down at the preparations from the nearest tree, and, not liking the sinister look of the scene, flew away, though hungry. By this time Arabella had joined her husband, and Jude, rope in hand, got into the sty, and noosed the affrighted animal, who, beginning with a squeak of surprise, rose to repeated cries of rage. Arabella opened the sty-door, and together they hoisted the victim on to the stool, legs upward, and while Jude held him Arabella bound him down, looping the cord over his legs to keep him from struggling.</p> 
<p>The animal's note changed its quality. It was not now rage, but the cry of despair; long-drawn, slow and hopeless.</p> 
<p>"Upon my soul I would sooner have gone without the pig than have had this to do!" said Jude. "A creature I have fed with my own hands."</p> 
<p>"Don't be such a tender-hearted fool! There's the sticking-knife-- the one with the point. Now whatever you do, don't stick un too deep."</p> 
<p>"I'll stick him effectually, so as to make short work of it. That's the chief thing."</p> 
<p>"You must not!" she cried. "The meat must be well bled, and to do that he must die slow. We shall lose a shilling a score if the meat is red and bloody! Just touch the vein, that's all. I was brought up to it, and I know. Every good butcher keeps un bleeding long. He ought to be eight or ten minutes dying, at least."</p> 
<p>"He shall not be half a minute if I can help it, however the meat may look," said Jude determinedly. Scraping the bristles from the pig's upturned throat, as he had seen the butchers do, he slit the fat; then plunged in the knife with all his might.</p> 
<p>"'Od damn it all!" she cried, "that ever I should say it! You've over-stuck un! And I telling you all the time----"</p> 
<p>"Do be quiet, Arabella, and have a little pity on the creature!"</p> 
<p>"Hold up the pail to catch the blood, and don't talk!"</p> 
<p>However unworkmanlike the deed, it had been mercifully done. The blood flowed out in a torrent instead of in the trickling stream she had desired. The dying animal's cry assumed its third and final tone, the shriek of agony; his glazing eyes riveting themselves on Arabella with the eloquently keen reproach of a creature recognizing at last the treachery of those who had seemed his only friends.</p> 
<p>"Make un stop that!" said Arabella. "Such a noise will bring somebody or other up here, and I don't want people to know we are doing it ourselves." Picking up the knife from the ground whereon Jude had flung it, she slipped it into the gash, and slit the windpipe. The pig was instantly silent, his dying breath coming through the hole</p> 
<p>"That's better," she said.</p> 
<p>"It is a hateful business!" said he.</p> 
<p>"Pigs must be killed."</p> 
<p>The animal heaved in a final convulsion, and, despite the rope, kicked out with all his last strength. A tablespoonful of black clot came forth, the trickling of red blood having ceased for some seconds.</p> 
<p>"That's it; now he'll go," said she. "Artful creatures-- they always keep back a drop like that as long as they can!"</p> 
<p>The last plunge had come so unexpectedly as to make Jude stagger, and in recovering himself he kicked over the vessel in which the blood had been caught.</p> 
<p>"There!" she cried, thoroughly in a passion. "Now I can't make any blackpot. There's a waste, all through you!"</p> 
<p>Jude put the pail upright, but only about a third of the whole steaming liquid was left in it, the main part being splashed over the snow, and forming a dismal, sordid, ugly spectacle-- to those who saw it as other than an ordinary obtaining of meat. The lips and nostrils of the animal turned livid, then white, and the muscles of his limbs relaxed.</p> 
<p>"Thank God!" Jude said. "He's dead."</p> 
<p>"What's God got to do with such a messy job as a pig-killing, I should like to know!" she said scornfully. "Poor folks must live."</p> 
<p>"I know, I know," said he. "I don't scold you."</p> 
<p>Suddenly they became aware of a voice at hand.</p> 
<p>"Well done, young married volk! I couldn't have carried it out much better myself, cuss me if I could!" The voice, which was husky, came from the garden-gate, and looking up from the scene of slaughter they saw the burly form of Mr. Challow leaning over the gate, critically surveying their performance.</p> 
<p>"'Tis well for 'ee to stand there and glane!" said Arabella. "Owing to your being late the meat is blooded and half spoiled! 'Twon't fetch so much by a shilling a score!"</p> 
<p>Challow expressed his contrition. "You should have waited a bit" he said, shaking his head, "and not have done this-- in the delicate state, too, that you be in at present, ma'am. 'Tis risking yourself too much."</p> 
<p>"You needn't be concerned about that," said Arabella, laughing. Jude too laughed, but there was a strong flavour of bitterness in his amusement.</p> 
<p>Challow made up for his neglect of the killing by zeal in the scalding and scraping. Jude felt dissatisfied with himself as a man at what he had done, though aware of his lack of common sense, and that the deed would have amounted to the same thing if carried out by deputy. The white snow, stained with the blood of his fellow-mortal, wore an illogical look to him as a lover of justice, not to say a Christian; but he could not see how the matter was to be mended. No doubt he was, as his wife had called him, a tender-hearted fool.</p> 
<p>He did not like the road to Alfredston now. It stared him cynically in the face. The wayside objects reminded him so much of his courtship of his wife that, to keep them out of his eyes, he read whenever he could as he walked to and from his work. Yet he sometimes felt that by caring for books he was not escaping common-place nor gaining rare ideas, every working-man being of that taste now. When passing near the spot by the stream on which he had first made her acquaintance he one day heard voices just as he had done at that earlier time. One of the girls who had been Arabella's companions was talking to a friend in a shed, himself being the subject of discourse, possibly because they had seen him in the distance. They were quite unaware that the shed-walls were so thin that he could hear their words as he passed.</p> 
<p>"Howsomever, 'twas I put her up to it! 'Nothing venture nothing have,' I said. If I hadn't she'd no more have been his mis'ess than I."</p> 
<p>"'Tis my belief she knew there was nothing the matter when she told him she was ..."</p> 
<p>What had Arabella been put up to by this woman, so that he should make her his "mis'ess," otherwise wife? The suggestion was horridly unpleasant, and it rankled in his mind so much that instead of entering his own cottage when he reached it he flung his basket inside the garden-gate and passed on, determined to go and see his old aunt and get some supper there.</p> 
<p>This made his arrival home rather late. Arabella however, was busy melting down lard from fat of the deceased pig, for she had been out on a jaunt all day, and so delayed her work. Dreading lest what he had heard should lead him to say something regrettable to her he spoke little. But Arabella was very talkative, and said among other things that she wanted some money. Seeing the book sticking out of his pocket she added that he ought to earn more.</p> 
<p>"An apprentice's wages are not meant to be enough to keep a wife on, as a rule, my dear."</p> 
<p>"Then you shouldn't have had one."</p> 
<p>"Come, Arabella! That's too bad, when you know how it came about."</p> 
<p>"I'll declare afore Heaven that I thought what I told you was true. Doctor Vilbert thought so. It was a good job for you that it wasn't so!"</p> 
<p>"I don't mean that," he said hastily. "I mean before that time. I know it was not your fault; but those women friends of yours gave you bad advice. If they hadn't, or you hadn't taken it, we should at this moment have been free from a bond which, not to mince matters, galls both of us devilishly. It may be very sad, but it is true."</p> 
<p>"Who's been telling you about my friends? What advice? I insist upon you telling me."</p> 
<p>"Pooh--I d rather not."</p> 
<p>"But you shall--you ought to. It is mean of 'ee not to!"</p> 
<p>"Very well." And he hinted gently what had been revealed to him. "But I don't wish to dwell upon it. Let us say no more about it."</p> 
<p>Her defensive manner collapsed. "That was nothing," she said, laughing coldly. "Every woman has a right to do such as that. The risk is hers."</p> 
<p>"I quite deny it, Bella. She might if no lifelong penalty attached to it for the man, or, in his default, for herself; if the weakness of the moment could end with the moment, or even with the year. But when effects stretch so far she should not go and do that which entraps a man if he is honest, or herself if he is otherwise."</p> 
<p>"What ought I to have done?"</p> 
<p>"Given me time.... Why do you fuss yourself about melting down that pig's fat to-night? Please put it away!"</p> 
<p>"Then I must do it to-morrow morning. It won't keep."</p> 
<p>"Very well--do."</p>

<p>裘德和他的妻子秋天在自己的猪圈里养肥的那头猪到了该宰的时候了，他们定好天一亮就动手，这样裘德到阿尔夫瑞顿干活，顶多误上一天的四分之一工。</p> 
<p>夜晚似乎静得出奇。天亮前，裘德朝窗外一瞧，只见满地都是雪——按节气说，雪似乎积得太深了，半天空还飘着雪花。</p> 
<p>“我看宰猪的八成来不了啦。”他对阿拉贝拉说。</p> 
<p>“哦，会来的。你要是叫查六刮猪毛，就起来把水烧开好啦。我可顶喜欢烫猪毛。”</p> 
<p>“我就起来，”裘德说，“我喜欢咱们这个郡宰猪的办法。”</p> 
<p>他到楼下，把铜锅底下的火点着，开始往里头塞豆秸，因为没点蜡烛，火苗一往上蹿，照得满屋子通亮，叫人觉着欢畅；可是他一想到火光熊熊的原因——水烧热了就是为给那个还活着的畜牲刮毛，这会儿却还听得见它在猪圈角上咕噜咕噜没个完，他的欢畅之感就差多了。到了六点半，也就是跟宰猪的约好的钟点，水开了，裘德的妻子来到楼下。</p> 
<p>“查六来了吗？”</p> 
<p>“还没来。”</p> 
<p>他们等着，天亮了点，这是由于下雪天黎明时分才有的阴凄的光。她走到门外，朝大路盯着，然后回来说：“他来不了啦，昨儿晚上大概喝醉了。雪不大，挡不住，没错儿！”</p> 
<p>“那就算了吧。就当水算自烧了。低谷里的雪大概够深的。”</p> 
<p>“不能算了。猪食没啦。大麦拌的料，昨儿早上它把剩下的都吃啦。”</p> 
<p>“昨儿早上。那它后来靠什么呀？”</p> 
<p>“什么也没有。”</p> 
<p>“那——它一直饿着？”</p> 
<p>“对。头一两天，都这么干，省得捣腾内脏时候麻烦。你真不开窍，连这个都不懂！”</p> 
<p>“怪不得它这么嚎喽，可怜的东西！”</p> 
<p>“好啦——咱们得自个儿给它一刀，没人帮忙啦。我做给你看，要不然我自个儿来也行——我看我办得到。这么一头大肥猪，我真想查六来宰它呢。反正装他的刀什么的篓子送过来啦，咱们就用他的。”</p> 
<p>“你千万别干，”裘德说，“要干，那就由我来。”</p> 
<p>他出了屋子，往猪圈去，把那儿的雪铲开，留出两码多一块空地，把凳子放到靠前的地方，拿起绳子和刀。一只知更鸟在顶近的树上偷偷瞧着他的准备工作，因为厌恶这丧气的场面，飞走了。阿拉贝拉这时到了丈夫身边。福来拿着绳子进了猪圈，套上又惊又怕的猪的脖子，那畜牲起先吓得吱吱叫，后来不断发出狂怒的吼声。阿拉贝拉打开圈门，两个人把那个受难者抬起来，放到凳子上，四脚朝天，阿拉贝拉乘着裘德把它按住，顺势把它绑死在凳子上，再用绳子把腿拴住，省得它乱踢乱动。</p> 
<p>那畜牲的声音渐渐变了调，不是狂怒的吼声了，而是绝望的叫喊，拖得很长，挺慢，表示完全没指望了。</p> 
<p>“我拿命起誓，要这么干，倒还不如当初没养它呢！”裘德说，“这家伙是我亲手喂大了哟。”</p> 
<p>“别充什么心慈面软的二百五吧！这儿就是尖刀——上边有个尖儿。不管你怎么扎，可就是别扎得深。”</p> 
<p>“我要一刀见效，省得它多受罪。这才要紧呢。”</p> 
<p>“不许你这样！”她大声喊着。“肉里头的血一定得好好流出来，要这样，它就得死得慢。肉要是红颜色，还带血，那二十磅肉，咱们就损失一先令啦！要整整扎在血管上头，千万别出错。我看宰猪长大的，我知道。宰猪的好把式，哪个都想法叫它血流得工夫长。至少得八九分钟之后死才行呢？”</p> 
<p>“我要是行好事，就不管肉什么样儿，用不了半分钟它就了啦。”裘德果决地说。他按看见过的宰猪法子，先把猪朝上的咽喉部位的鬃毛刮干净，再开个口子，把里边的肥膘剔出来，然后用尽全力，一刀猛扎进去。</p> 
<p>“你要死啦！”她大叫，“你气得我胡说啦！你扎得太厉害啦！我一直跟你说——”</p> 
<p>“别急，别急，阿拉贝拉，可怜可怜这个畜牲吧！”</p> 
<p>“快拿桶接血吧，别费话啦！”</p> 
<p>不管裘德干得多外行，他总算干了件慈悲事。猪血不像她期望那样涓涓细流，而是洪流汹涌一般。要咽气的畜牲的叫声第三次，也是最后一次变了音，那是充满痛苦的撕心裂腑的尖叫，它两只呆滞无光的眼睛瞪着阿拉贝拉，仿佛那畜牲到了末日才明白过来原先像朋友的那些人居然那么凶狡，因而流露出来叫人望而生畏的强烈的谴责。</p> 
<p>“别让它再叫啦！”阿拉贝拉说。“这样叫要把方近左右的人都招来了，我可不愿意人家知道咱们自个儿干这事儿。”她从地上拣起裘德扔下的尖刀，对着刀口往深里一扎，把气管一搅，猪立刻没声了，它最后一口气就是从那个窟窿冒出来的。</p> 
<p>“行啦。”她说。</p> 
<p>“这活儿太讨厌啦！”他说。</p> 
<p>“猪反正得宰呀。”</p> 
<p>那头猪最后抽搐时呻吟了一声，尽管绳子绑得结结实实，它还是尽最后剩下的力气挣扎了一下。有一匙子那么多的黑血块流了出来，红血在几秒钟之前就没滴滴答答了。</p> 
<p>“好啦，它走啦，”她说，“多刁的东西——只要行，它们总要这样留一手。”</p> 
<p>猪最后冷不防来的那个猛烈动作，叫裘德打了个趔趄；他刚想稳住，就把装血的桶踢翻了。</p> 
<p>“你瞧瞧！”她大喊大叫，勃然大怒。“我做不成血肠啦！东西糟塌啦，全怪你！”</p> 
<p>裘德把桶放正了，但是冒热气的血只剩下三分之一，大部分泼到雪上面——那情景叫那些平常只知道吃猪肉的人会觉着惨。肮脏、丑恶吧。那畜牲的嘴唇和鼻孔变青了，又变白了，四肢的肉也松弛了。</p> 
<p>“感谢上帝啊！”裘德说。‘它死啦！”</p> 
<p>“宰猪这个脏活儿怎么扯得上上帝，我倒要知道知道！”她不屑地说。“穷人得吃饭嘛！”</p> 
<p>忽然他们听见旁边有说话声音。</p> 
<p>“干得好呀，你们小两口儿！就是我干，也比你们好不到哪儿。”</p> 
<p>沙哑的声音是从园门那边过来的；他们从宰猪地方抬头一看，只见查六先生魁梧的身子靠在篱笆门上，用评审的眼光考查他们演的这出戏。</p> 
<p>“你还好意思站在那儿说风凉话呢？”阿拉贝拉说。“你这么一耽误，肉里头就留了血啦，一半肉不值钱啦！要二十磅赚一先令，就没那么多啦！”</p> 
<p>查六表示了歉意。“你本来可以多等会儿嘛。”他说，摇摇头。“用不着急嘛——再说你这会儿是重身子，才娇贵哪，太太。你可太大意啦。”</p> 
<p>“这就用不着你操这份心啦。”阿拉贝拉说，笑起来了，裘德也笑了，听他这么说，既觉得逗乐，又感到强烈的苦涩味儿。</p> 
<p>查六既然耽误了宰猪活儿，为弥补起见，刮剔起猪毛来就格外卖劲。裘德自以为堂堂男子汉，不该于刚才那样腌臢勾当，感到很不适意；不过他心里也明白，他这么想实在有悖一般情理，何况他不干，也会有人替他于，还不是一样嘛。那个跟他同属天地万物的东西，已经血染白雪了，令他这个自命主持公道的人，姑且不提他这个基督徒吧，感到极端的悖谬。可是他对这类事情也想不出来什么补救之良方，纠正之善策。他妻子称他为心慈面软的二百五，无疑是说对了。</p> 
<p>现在他讨厌再走去阿尔夫瑞顿的那条路，因为老觉着那条路嬉皮笑脸地对他不转眼地瞪着，路两边的东西老是叫他回想起当初跟妻子谈情说爱时的情况；为了不看它们，他上下工一路上，不论什么时候，只要可能，就一边走一边看书。然而他有时也觉得，光泡在书里，既摆脱不了庸俗，也没法获得不平凡的思想，何况凡干活的人的趣味现在都是一个样。他经常走过河边他跟阿拉贝拉初次相识时那个地点，有一天听见从前跟阿拉贝拉一伙的一个姑娘正在棚子里跟一个朋友聊天，聊的题目正好是他。说不定她们已经从远处望见他过来了，她们万没想到因为棚壁太薄，她们聊什么，他路过时候都听见了。</p> 
<p>“不管怎么说吧，反正都是我指点的！‘想做生意，就先别怕赔本儿。’我说。要是我不指点，她可当不了他房里头的呢。”</p> 
<p>“我可千信万信，她跟他说了她已经怀了……她明知道根本没那回事儿……”</p> 
<p>那个女人究竟怎么指点阿拉贝拉，他就得要她当“房里头的”，或者说做他的老婆？往这上面一想真是觉得可憎到了极点，他心里不由得痛楚万分，以至于过草房之门而不人，把工具篓子往园子里头一扔，决心去看望老站婆，在那儿混顿晚饭。</p> 
<p>这一来他到家就很晚了。不过那会儿阿拉贝拉还忙着用死猪肥膘熬油呢，因为她出去逛了一天，把事耽误了。他生怕自己因为一时听到那些话，就对她说出不中听的话，所以一直不吱声。但是阿拉贝拉倒唧唧呱呱没个完，其中一件事就是她需要点钱；她瞧见他口袋里书鼓着，就又说，他应该多赚点钱才对。</p> 
<p>“一个当学徒的工钱一般是养不起一个老婆啊，我的亲爱的。”</p> 
<p>“那你就不该要一个嘛。”</p> 
<p>“得啦吧！你这话太差劲喽！你明明知道是怎么回事儿嘛。”</p> 
<p>“我要对着老天爷起誓，我那会儿想的，我跟你说的，都是实话。韦伯大夫也这么想的。没这宗子事，你倒是称心如意啦。”</p> 
<p>“我可不是这意思。”他赶紧说。“我指的是以前的事。我知道不是你的错；可是你那些朋友替你出了坏点子。要是她们没这样干，要么你当时没听她们的，咱们这会儿哪能捆到一块儿呀，用不着绕着弯儿说啦，这一捆可把咱们俩都害苦啦。这未免叫人太难受啦，可这又一点不假啊。”</p> 
<p>“谁跟你议论我朋友来着？什么点子？你非告诉我不行。”</p> 
<p>“呸！我就不说。”</p> 
<p>“你要说——你该说。你要是不说，就是变着法儿冤枉我。”</p> 
<p>“那好吧。”于是他用很和缓的口气把人家无意中露给他的那些话大致说了说。“不过我决不想为这个纠缠不清。咱们别再说啦。”</p> 
<p>她的守势一败涂地了。“这算得了什么，”她说，皮笑肉不笑的。“随便哪个女人都可以这么干嘛。出了事怪她自个儿就是啦。”</p> 
<p>“你这话，我可决不承认，贝拉。她那么干，要是没带累男的一辈子受罪，反过来没因为男人胡来，带累她自个儿一辈子受罪，那还说得过去；她那么干，要是出于一时半会儿意志薄弱，把持不住，而且一时半会儿也就过去了，哪怕一年才过去吧，那也还情有可原。可要是男的是个老实人，那么干的结果，影响深远的话，那她就不应该那么干了，老把他套住不放了。反过来，他要是不老实，她也不应该老把自个儿套住不放啊。”</p> 
<p>“照你看，我从前怎么干才好呢？”</p> 
<p>“你得给我点时间想想……你干吗晚上紧着熬油呢？算啦，好不好？”</p> 
<p>“那我就得明儿一大早干啦。这东西放不住。”</p> 
<p>“好，好——就这么着。”</p>
