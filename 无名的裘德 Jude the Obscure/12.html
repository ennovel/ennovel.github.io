<p>"That's the story about me in Marygreen, is it--that I entrapped 'ee? Much of a catch you were, Lord send!" As she warmed she saw some of Jude's dear ancient classics on a table where they ought not to have been laid. "I won't have them books here in the way!" she cried petulantly; and seizing them one by one she began throwing them upon the floor.</p> 
<p>"Leave my books alone!" he said. "You might have thrown them aside if you had liked, but as to soiling them like that, it is disgusting!" In the operation of making lard Arabella's hands had become smeared with the hot grease, and her fingers consequently left very perceptible imprints on the book-covers. She continued deliberately to toss the books severally upon the floor, till Jude, incensed beyond bearing, caught her by the arms to make her leave off. Somehow, in going so, he loosened the fastening of her hair, and it rolled about her ears.</p> 
<p>"Let me go!" she said.</p> 
<p>"Promise to leave the books alone."</p> 
<p>She hesitated. "Let me go!" she repeated.</p> 
<p>"Promise!"</p> 
<p>After a pause: "I do."</p> 
<p>Jude relinquished his hold, and she crossed the room to the door, out of which she went with a set face, and into the highway. Here she began to saunter up and down, perversely pulling her hair into a worse disorder than he had caused, and unfastening several buttons of her gown. It was a fine Sunday morning, dry, clear and frosty, and the bells of Alfredston Church could be heard on the breeze from the north. People were going along the road, dressed in their holiday clothes; they were mainly lovers--such pairs as Jude and Arabella had been when they sported along the same track some months earlier. These pedestrians turned to stare at the extraordinary spectacle she now presented, bonnetless, her dishevelled hair blowing in the wind, her bodice apart her sleeves rolled above her elbows for her work, and her hands reeking with melted fat. One of the passers said in mock terror: "Good Lord deliver us!"</p> 
<p>"See how he's served me!" she cried. "Making me work Sunday mornings when I ought to be going to my church, and tearing my hair off my head, and my gown off my back!"</p> 
<p>Jude was exasperated, and went out to drag her in by main force. Then he suddenly lost his heat. Illuminated with the sense that all was over between them, and that it mattered not what she did, or he, her husband stood still, regarding her. Their lives were ruined, he thought; ruined by the fundamental error of their matrimonial union: that of having based a permanent contract on a temporary feeling which had no necessary connection with affinities that alone render a lifelong comradeship tolerable.</p> 
<p>"Going to ill-use me on principle, as your father ill-used your mother, and your father's sister ill-used her husband?" she asked. "All you be a queer lot as husbands and wives!"</p> 
<p>Jude fixed an arrested, surprised look on her. But she said no more, and continued her saunter till she was tired. He left the spot, and, after wandering vaguely a little while, walked in the direction of Marygreen. Here he called upon his great-aunt, whose infirmities daily increased.</p> 
<p>"Aunt--did my father ill-use my mother, and my aunt her husband?" said Jude abruptly, sitting down by the fire.</p> 
<p>She raised her ancient eyes under the rim of the by-gone bonnet that she always wore. "Who's been telling you that?" she said.</p> 
<p>"I have heard it spoken of, and want to know all."</p> 
<p>"You med so well, I s'pose; though your wife--I reckon 'twas she-- must have been a fool to open up that! There isn't much to know after all. Your father and mother couldn't get on together, and they parted. It was coming home from Alfredston market, when you were a baby-- on the hill by the Brown House barn--that they had their last difference, and took leave of one another for the last time. Your mother soon afterwards died--she drowned herself, in short, and your father went away with you to South Wessex, and never came here any more."</p> 
<p>Jude recalled his father's silence about North Wessex and Jude's mother, never speaking of either till his dying day.</p> 
<p>"It was the same with your father's sister. Her husband offended her, and she so disliked living with him afterwards that she went away to London with her little maid. The Fawleys were not made for wedlock: it never seemed to sit well upon us. There's sommat in our blood that won't take kindly to the notion of being bound to do what we do readily enough if not bound. That's why you ought to have hearkened to me, and not ha' married."</p> 
<p>"Where did Father and Mother part--by the Brown House, did you say?"</p> 
<p>"A little further on--where the road to Fenworth branches off, and the handpost stands. A gibbet once stood there not onconnected with our history. But let that be."</p> 
<p>In the dusk of that evening Jude walked away from his old aunt's as if to go home. But as soon as he reached the open down he struck out upon it till he came to a large round pond. The frost continued, though it was not particularly sharp, and the larger stars overhead came out slow and flickering. Jude put one foot on the edge of the ice, and then the other: it cracked under his weight; but this did not deter him. He ploughed his way inward to the centre, the ice making sharp noises as he went. When just about the middle he looked around him and gave a jump. The cracking repeated itself; but he did not go down. He jumped again, but the cracking had ceased. Jude went back to the edge, and stepped upon the ground.</p> 
<p>It was curious, he thought. What was he reserved for? He supposed he was not a sufficiently dignified person for suicide. Peaceful death abhorred him as a subject, and would not take him.</p> 
<p>What could he do of a lower kind than self-extermination; what was there less noble, more in keeping with his present degraded position? He could get drunk. Of course that was it; he had forgotten. Drinking was the regular, stereotyped resource of the despairing worthless. He began to see now why some men boozed at inns. He struck down the hill northwards and came to an obscure public-house. On entering and sitting down the sight of the picture of Samson and Delilah on the wall caused him to recognize the place as that he had visited with Arabella on that first Sunday evening of their courtship. He called for liquor and drank briskly for an hour or more.</p> 
<p>Staggering homeward late that night, with all his sense of depression gone, and his head fairly clear still, he began to laugh boisterously, and to wonder how Arabella would receive him in his new aspect. The house was in darkness when he entered, and in his stumbling state it was some time before he could get a light. Then he found that, though the marks of pig-dressing, of fats and scallops, were visible, the materials themselves had been taken away. A line written by his wife on the inside of an old envelope was pinned to the cotton blower of the fireplace:</p> 
<p>"HAVE GONE TO MY FRIENDS. SHALL NOT RETURN."</p> 
<p>All the next day he remained at home, and sent off the carcase of the pig to Alfredston. He then cleaned up the premises, locked the door, put the key in a place she would know if she came back, and returned to his masonry at Alfredston.</p> 
<p>At night when he again plodded home he found she had not visited the house. The next day went in the same way, and the next. Then there came a letter from her.</p> 
<p>That she had gone tired of him she frankly admitted. He was such a slow old coach, and she did not care for the sort of life he led. There was no prospect of his ever bettering himself or her. She further went on to say that her parents had, as he knew, for some time considered the question of emigrating to Australia, the pig-jobbing business being a poor one nowadays. They had at last decided to go, and she proposed to go with them, if he had no objection. A woman of her sort would have more chance over there than in this stupid country.</p> 
<p>Jude replied that he had not the least objection to her going. He thought it a wise course, since she wished to go, and one that might be to the advantage of both. He enclosed in the packet containing the letter the money that had been realized by the sale of the pig, with all he had besides, which was not much.</p> 
<p>From that day he heard no more of her except indirectly, though her father and his household did not immediately leave, but waited till his goods and other effects had been sold off. When Jude learnt that there was to be an auction at the house of the Donns he packed his own household goods into a waggon, and sent them to her at the aforesaid homestead, that she might sell them with the rest, or as many of them as she should choose.</p> 
<p>He then went into lodgings at Alfredston, and saw in a shopwindow the little handbill announcing the sale of his father-in-law's furniture. He noted its date, which came and passed without Jude's going near the place, or perceiving that the traffic out of Alfredston by the southern road was materially increased by the auction. A few days later he entered a dingy broker's shop in the main street of the town, and amid a heterogeneous collection of saucepans, a clothes-horse, rolling-pin, brass candlestick, swing looking-glass, and other things at the back of the shop, evidently just brought in from a sale, he perceived a framed photograph, which turned out to be his own portrait.</p> 
<p>It was one which he had had specially taken and framed by a local man in bird's-eye maple, as a present for Arabella, and had duly given her on their wedding-day. On the back was still to be read, "JUDE TO ARABELLA," with the date. She must have thrown it in with the rest of her property at the auction.</p> 
<p>"Oh," said the broker, seeing him look at this and the other articles in the heap, and not perceiving that the portrait was of himself: "It is a small lot of stuff that was knocked down to me at a cottage sale out on the road to Marygreen. The frame is a very useful one, if you take out the likeness. You shall have it for a shilling."</p> 
<p>The utter death of every tender sentiment in his wife, as brought home to him by this mute and undesigned evidence of her sale of his portrait and gift, was the conclusive little stroke required to demolish all sentiment in him. He paid the shilling, took the photograph away with him, and burnt it, frame and all, when he reached his lodging.</p> 
<p>Two or three days later he heard that Arabella and her parents had departed. He had sent a message offering to see her for a formal leave-taking, but she had said that it would be better otherwise, since she was bent on going, which perhaps was true. On the evening following their emigration, when his day's work was done, he came out of doors after supper, and strolled in the starlight along the too familiar road towards the upland whereon had been experienced the chief emotions of his life. It seemed to be his own again.</p> 
<p>He could not realize himself. On the old track he seemed to be a boy still, hardly a day older than when he had stood dreaming at the top of that hill, inwardly fired for the first time with ardours for Christminster and scholarship. "Yet I am a man," he said. "I have a wife. More, I have arrived at the still riper stage of having disagreed with her, disliked her, had a scuffle with her, and parted from her."</p> 
<p>He remembered then that he was standing not far from the spot at which the parting between his father and his mother was said to have occurred.</p> 
<p>A little further on was the summit whence Christminster, or what he had taken for that city, had seemed to be visible. A milestone, now as always, stood at the roadside hard by. Jude drew near it, and felt rather than read the mileage to the city. He remembered that once on his way home he had proudly cut with his keen new chisel an inscription on the back of that milestone, embodying his aspirations. It had been done in the first week of his apprenticeship, before he had been diverted from his purposes by an unsuitable woman. He wondered if the inscription were legible still, and going to the back of the milestone brushed away the nettles. By the light of a match he could still discern what he had cut so enthusiastically so long ago:</p> 
<p>THITHER J. F. (with a pointing finger)</p> 
<p>The sight of it, unimpaired, within its screen of grass and nettles, lit in his soul a spark of the old fire. Surely his plan should be to move onward through good and ill-- to avoid morbid sorrow even though he did see uglinesses in the world? BENE AGERE ET LOETARI--to do good cheerfully-- which he had heard to be the philosophy of one Spinoza, might be his own even now.</p> 
<p>He might battle with his evil star, and follow out his original intention.</p> 
<p>By moving to a spot a little way off he uncovered the horizon in a north-easterly direction. There actually rose the faint halo, a small dim nebulousness, hardly recognizable save by the eye of faith. It was enough for him. He would go to Christminster as soon as the term of his apprenticeship expired.</p> 
<p>He returned to his lodgings in a better mood, and said his prayers.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>第二天适逢礼拜天，上午十点钟光景，阿拉贝拉开始熬猪油。她一于这个活儿，马上想起头天晚上熬猪油时候他们两个的谈话，桀骛不驯惯了，又发起脾气来。</p> 
<p>“那就是我的新闻，在马利格林传遍了吧，对不对？——我把你套住啦。你可真值得人套住啊！好家伙！”她火冒三丈，一眼瞧见裘德心爱的古典著作放在桌上不该放的地方。“我不许书放在那儿！”她气哼哼地说，抓起书来，一本本往地下摔。</p> 
<p>“别动我的书！”他说。“你瞧着不顺眼，随便扔一边去就是啦。可这么糟塌书，未免太不像话啦！”阿拉贝拉熬油的手沾着油，书上明显地留下了她指头印子。她继续故意地把地上的书踢来踢去，裘德实在忍无可忍了，一把抓住她的胳臂，想把她拉到一边去，没想到顺带着碰松了她的发髻，她的头发散了下来。</p> 
<p>“放开我！”她说。</p> 
<p>“你答应不动书就放开。”</p> 
<p>她迟疑了一下，又说，“放开我！”</p> 
<p>“你答应才行。”</p> 
<p>稍停了停：“我答应。”</p> 
<p>裘德松开手，她哭丧着脸，穿过屋子，出了门，上了大路，在大路上转来转去，居心不良地把自己弄得披头散发，比他碰上去的时候还乱。她还把长袍上的钮扣解开了几个。那会儿礼拜天上午，晴朗、干燥、霜后清冽，听得见北风送来的阿尔夫瑞顿教堂的钟声。大路上人来人往，穿着度假衣装，他们大都是情侣——一双双一对对跟裘德和阿拉贝拉从前一样。他们俩早几个月也在那条路上蹓跶过。过路人不免扭过头来，盯着她做出来的那副怪模怪样：女帽也没戴，头发乱蓬蓬在风里飘，袖子因为做事一直卷到了肘上边，两手沾着熬化了的猪油。有个过路人装出害怕样子，说，“老天爷救救咱们呀。”</p> 
<p>“你们都瞧瞧呀，他就是这样收拾我哟。”她哇啦哇啦大叫。“大礼拜天的，我该当上教堂，他叫我在家里干活，还把我头发扯下来，把我的长袍也从背上扯开啦。”</p> 
<p>裘德气极败坏，跑出屋子，拼命要把她往回拉。突然一下子，他一点气力都没了。她的丈夫恍然大悟，他们的关系已经完了，不论她还是他，再怎么样也无济于事了。他一动不动地站着，冷冷地看着她。他们两个人的生活都毁啦，他心里想着。他们的结合所以成立，原来是靠了一时冲动、片刻欢娱做基础而订下的永世长存的婚约，根本不具备万不可少的心心相印，相互体贴。而只要是心心相印，相互体贴，就能两情欢洽，终始不渝。</p> 
<p>“你一定要像你爸爸虐待你妈，你爸爸的妹妹虐待她男人那样虐待我吗？”她问。“你们家男男女女，丈夫也好，老婆也好，都是一群怪物。”</p> 
<p>裘德死死盯住她，眼光流露出惊愕。但是她并没往下说，继续转来转去，后来转得她自己也觉着累了。他离开了她呆的地方，茫无目的地转悠了一会儿，随后向马利格林走去。他要去找姑婆，而她是一天比一天衰弱了。</p> 
<p>“姑婆——我爸爸真是虐待我妈吗？我姑姑真是虐待她丈夫吗？”裘德坐在火旁边，没头没脑地问。</p> 
<p>她一年到头戴着过时的帽子，老眼昏花，从帽檐底下抬起来看。“哪个跟你说这个啦？”</p> 
<p>“我听人说过，想从头到尾知道知道。”</p> 
<p>“我猜你早晚会这样；可我估摸着还是你老婆起的这个头儿，她真是个糊涂虫，要提这事儿。其实也没什么值得知道的。你爸爸跟你妈在一块儿过不下去，就散啦。那会儿是打阿尔夫瑞顿庙会上回来，你还怀抱哪——就在棕房子旁边山上，两个人最后闹翻了，就彼此拜拜，各奔东西啦。以后没多久，你妈死啦——简单说吧，她投水死的。你爸爸就把你带到南维塞克斯去啦，以后压根儿没来过。”</p> 
<p>裘德想起来，他父亲对北维塞克斯和裘德母亲的事总是守口如瓶，临死那天也一个字没提。</p> 
<p>“你爸爸的妹妹也是那么回事儿。她丈夫惹火了她，她实在讨厌跟他一块儿过，就带了她的小丫头上伦敦啦。福来家的人生来不是成家的料；凡成过家的压根儿没过过好日子。咱们血里总有个什么东西，你要是压着他干，他可是决不买账；要是不压着，倒愿意顺条顺理地干呢。所以说，你本来该好好听我的话，别结婚，道理就在这儿。”</p> 
<p>“爸爸妈妈在哪儿分的手呢——在栋房子旁边？你这么说的吧？”</p> 
<p>“稍微往前点——大路就打那儿岔到芬司屋，还立着指路牌呢。以前那儿还立过绞架，跟咱们家历史可没关系。”</p> 
<p>天色向晚，裘德在黄昏时分离开姑婆家，意思像是回家。可是刚走到开阔的丘陵地，他就阔步而k，直趋一个圆形大池塘。寒气渐甚，但并不凛冽，大些的星斗缓缓出现在上空，闪烁不定。裘德先一只脚踩在塘边冰上，然后又踩上一只脚：在他的身体的压力下，冰嘎巴嘎巴响起来，不过没把他吓住。他试着一步一步地往里走，到了塘中央，跟着冰响起了爆裂声。差不多到塘中间时候，他朝四处望了望，然后蹦起来一下，又听见了嘎巴嘎巴声。再蹦一下，爆裂声反而停了。裘德回到塘边，到了地上。</p> 
<p>这大怪啦，他心里想。把他留下来又有什么用呢？他认为他还没有想自杀的人那种巍巍气度吧，所以温文尔雅的死神看不上他，认为他不配当子民，不肯召走他。</p> 
<p>有没有比自己轻生还下一等的死法来结果自己，办法不必那么高尚，可又更适合自己这会儿落到的卑屈处境呢？他可以喝得醺醺大醉嘛，这个办法明摆着，他可忘啦。喝酒一向是沧于绝境的贫苦下贱人消愁解闷的老一套办法。他开始懂得了有些人干吗老是泡在小酒店里头。他朝北大踏步下山，到了一家不起眼的小酒店。进去坐下来之后，他瞧见墙上参孙和大利亚的画像，才认出来就是他跟阿拉贝拉恋爱头一个礼拜天晚上到过的地方。他痛饮了大概一个多钟头。</p> 
<p>到了半夜，他晃晃悠悠往家走，沮丧感一点也没有了，头脑倒挺清醒的。他狂笑不已，琢磨着阿拉贝拉看到他这个新鲜样儿，该怎么对付他。进家时候，里头漆黑一片，他跌跌撞撞，好容易才摸着火柴，点起了蜡烛，这才看明白整猪经过收拾，猪油已经熬过，猪肉已经切片的明显痕迹，不过这些东西全拿开了。他的妻子在一个旧信封反面上写了一行字，用针别在壁炉的挡风帘上：</p> 
<p>“到朋友家。不回来了。”</p> 
<p>第二天他整天呆在家里，托人把猪身子送到阿尔夫瑞顿；然后把家里收拾干净，锁好门，把钥匙放在她万一回来能找得到的地方，就上阿尔夫瑞顿石作坊去了。</p> 
<p>晚上他又有气无力地回到家里，可是没看到她。第二天、第三天也一样。后来她来了封信。</p> 
<p>她直言无隐，承认她已经腻味他。他跟个老牛破车似的，她才不愿意过那样的日子。也看不出来他也好、她也好，以后能好到哪儿去。又接着说，他已经知道她父母考虑移居澳洲有一段时间了，这年头养猪是个穷生意。他们已经最后决定走了，她提出来跟他们一块儿走，要是他们肯的话。像她这样女人到那个地方要比守在死气沉沉的乡下机会总要多些。</p> 
<p>裘德回信说他毫无异议，她只管走好啦。他认为，既然她想走，不失为一个好办法，对他们双方都有好处。他在装信的小包里，封进去卖猪的钱，还有他自己不多一点钱。</p> 
<p>从那天起，他没再收到她的信，无非间接听到点消息，不过她父亲和全家并没立刻动身，还要等到把货同别的财物出清再说。裘德一听说邓恩家要拍卖，就把自己的一应家私装上一辆货车，送到她那儿，也就是前面提到过的那个小庄院，让她把那些东西跟别的一块儿卖掉，她爱卖什么就卖什么。</p> 
<p>他随后搬到阿尔夫瑞顿的住处，看见一家铺子的窗子上有张小招贴，通告甩卖他岳父的家具。他注意出售的日期，那一天来了又过去了，裘德也没往那儿附近去。他也没看到因为拍卖，靠南边路上阿尔夫瑞顿镇外车马比平常真正多起来。又过了几天，他走进镇上一家旧货代理店，店堂后面放着品类繁多的大杂烩，什么汤锅、晾衣架、擀面杖、铜烛台、两面镜子等等，显而易见都是经过甩卖来的，这时他发现一张带框的相片，原来是他自己的尊容。</p> 
<p>那张相片是特意请镇上一个人拍的，配上了有椭圆形鸟眼纹的槭木框子，他选在婚礼那天送给她，相片背面还留着“裘德赠给阿拉贝拉”的字样和日期。她准是把它扔到了她要拍卖的财物一块儿了。</p> 
<p>“哦。”店老板说。虽然看着他瞧了瞧相片，又瞧了瞧一大堆别的东西，他却没有发觉他就是相片中人，并且向他解释说，“到马利格林那条路上，靠一边有个草房，把东西甩卖了，这玩意儿是搭着卖给我的。要是把相片取下来，镜框还是蛮有用的。你给一先令拿走好啦。”</p> 
<p>他的妻子把他的照片和礼物也连着别的东西甩卖，是个不言而喻而又出乎自然的证据，说明了她对他绝情到了多么彻底的地步，而这正是少不了的了却一切的轻轻一击，好把他全部的眷念之情摧毁到家。他付了一先令，把相片带走，到了住处，就把相片带框子烧了。</p> 
<p>两三天后，他听说阿拉贝拉和她的父母已经启程远行。事前，他带过口信给她，提出要郑重其事地给她送行，不过她表示她已经志在必走，就不必多此一举，反而好些。她这样说也许不无道理吧。在他们移居国外以后那个晚上，他一天的活已经干完，就离开住处，循着极熟悉的大路，在星光下漫步，向高地走去，那是他有生以来体验从未有过的极度欢娱之情的地方。这会儿高地仿佛又重归他的怀抱了。</p> 
<p>他自己究意怎么回事，他也弄不清了。在那条古道上，他好像还是个孩子，比起当年他站在山顶上做梦，胸中头一次燃烧着对基督堂和学问的热烈向往之情的时候，似乎连一天都没长大。“但是我现在是成年人了。”他说。“我有了妻子。不单是这样，我跟她闹别扭，觉着她可厌，还跟她打了架，最后一刀两断，我已经到了一个成熟得多的阶段啦。”</p> 
<p>接着他想起来他这会儿站的地方，据姑婆说就是当年他父母仳离的地方。</p> 
<p>再往前一点就到了最高处，犹记当年基督堂，或他以为是的那个城市，曾依稀可辨。挨着路边，一直稳稳竖着一块里程碑。裘德慢慢走到它旁边，碑上标的里数已经没法看清楚，只好拿手摸摸。他想起来有一回他在回家路上，一时兴起，自鸣得意地用锐利的新凿子在里程碑碑阴上錾下一行字。还是他当学徒头一个礼拜干的，当时他还没为一个跟他格格不入的女人而偏离自己努力的目标。他不知道字迹如今清楚不清楚，于是转到碑后，拨开了尊麻丛，借着一根火柴的亮光，他终于看清了老早以前自己何等热情奔放地錾下了：</p> 
<p>到那边去</p> 
<p>J．F．</p> 
<p>重睹在蔓草和荨麻掩覆下、略无漫漶的那行字，他心中再次燃起往日的激情的火花。难道他就不想在善与恶交织中把自己的计划推向前进吗？——哪怕实实在在感受了世间丑恶，就不要力戒病态的愁苦吗？Bene agers et loetari——高高兴兴地做好事，这是他听说过的一位名叫斯宾诺沙的人的哲学，现在不也可以成为他自己的哲学吗？</p> 
<p>他要跟命里灾星斗下去，要把他原先的抱负付诸实现。</p> 
<p>他走到稍远一点的地方，极目遥注东北方地平线。那儿空中果然有一团微弱的光晕，有一小缕淡淡的烟云，但是倘若不是虔诚的目光，那就不大能看到了。他觉得这样就够了。只要他学徒期一满，他必定前往基督堂。</p> 
<p>他回到住处，心情好多了，做了祈祷。</p>
