<p>Before reading the letter he was led to suspect that its contents were of a somewhat serious kind by catching sight of the signature-- which was in her full name, never used in her correspondence with him since her first note:</p> 
<p>MY DEAR JUDE,--I have something to tell you which perhaps you will not be surprised to hear, though certainly it may strike you as being accelerated (as the railway companies say of their trains). Mr. Phillotson and I are to be married quite soon-- in three or four weeks. We had intended, as you know, to wait till I had gone through my course of training and obtained my certificate, so as to assist him, if necessary, in the teaching. But he generously says he does not see any object in waiting, now I am not at the training school. It is so good of him, because the awkwardness of my situation has really come about by my fault in getting expelled.</p> 
<p>Wish me joy. Remember I say you are to, and you mustn't refuse!-- Your affectionate cousin,</p> 
<p>SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY BRIDEHEAD.</p> 
<p>Jude staggered under the news; could eat no breakfast; and kept on drinking tea because his mouth was so dry. Then presently he went back to his work and laughed the usual bitter laugh of a man so confronted. Everything seemed turning to satire. And yet, what could the poor girl do? he asked himself: and felt worse than shedding tears.</p> 
<p>"O Susanna Florence Mary!" he said as he worked. "You don't know what marriage means!"</p> 
<p>Could it be possible that his announcement of his own marriage had pricked her on to this, just as his visit to her when in liquor may have pricked her on to her engagement? To be sure, there seemed to exist these other and sufficient reasons, practical and social, for her decision; but Sue was not a very practical or calculating person; and he was compelled to think that a pique at having his secret sprung upon her had moved her to give way to Phillotson's probable representations, that the best course to prove how unfounded were the suspicions of the school authorities would be to marry him off-hand, as in fulfilment of an ordinary engagement. Sue had, in fact, been placed in an awkward corner. Poor Sue!</p> 
<p>He determined to play the Spartan; to make the best of it, and support her; but he could not write the requested good wishes for a day or two. Meanwhile there came another note from his impatient little dear:</p> 
<p>Jude, will you give me away? I have nobody else who could do it so conveniently as you, being the only married relation I have here on the spot, even if my father were friendly enough to be willing, which he isn't. I hope you won't think it a trouble? I have been looking at the marriage service in the prayer-book, and it seems to me very humiliating that a giver-away should be required at all. According to the ceremony as there printed, my bridegroom chooses me of his own will and pleasure; but I don't choose him. Somebody GIVES me to him, like a she-ass or she-goat, or any other domestic animal. Bless your exalted views of woman, O churchman! But I forget: I am no longer privileged to tease you.--Ever,</p> 
<p>SUSANNA FLORENCE MARY BRIDEHEAD.</p> 
<p>Jude screwed himself up to heroic key; and replied:</p> 
<p>MY DEAR SUE,--Of course I wish you joy! And also of course I will give you away. What I suggest is that, as you have no house of your own, you do not marry from your school friend's, but from mine. It would be more proper, I think, since I am, as you say, the person nearest related to you in this part of the world.</p> 
<p>I don't see why you sign your letter in such a new and terribly formal way? Surely you care a bit about me still!--Ever your affectionate, JUDE.</p> 
<p>What had jarred on him even more than the signature was a little sting he had been silent on--the phrase "married relation"-- What an idiot it made him seem as her lover! If Sue had written that in satire, he could hardly forgive her; if in suffering-- ah, that was another thing!</p> 
<p>His offer of his lodging must have commended itself to Phillotson at any rate, for the schoolmaster sent him a line of warm thanks, accepting the convenience. Sue also thanked him. Jude immediately moved into more commodious quarters, as much to escape the espionage of the suspicious landlady who had been one cause of Sue's unpleasant experience as for the sake of room.</p> 
<p>Then Sue wrote to tell him the day fixed for the wedding; and Jude decided, after inquiry, that she should come into residence on the following Saturday, which would allow of a ten days' stay in the city prior to the ceremony, sufficiently representing a nominal residence of fifteen.</p> 
<p>She arrived by the ten o'clock train on the day aforesaid, Jude not going to meet her at the station, by her special request, that he should not lose a morning's work and pay, she said (if this were her true reason). But so well by this time did he know Sue that the remembrance of their mutual sensitiveness at emotional crises might, he thought, have weighed with her in this. When he came home to dinner she had taken possession of her apartment.</p> 
<p>She lived in the same house with him, but on a different floor, and they saw each other little, an occasional supper being the only meal they took together, when Sue's manner was something like that of a scared child. What she felt he did not know; their conversation was mechanical, though she did not look pale or ill. Phillotson came frequently, but mostly when Jude was absent. On the morning of the wedding, when Jude had given himself a holiday, Sue and her cousin had breakfast together for the first and last time during this curious interval; in his room--the parlour-- which he had hired for the period of Sue's residence. Seeing, as women do, how helpless he was in making the place comfortable, she bustled about.</p> 
<p>"What's the matter, Jude?" she said suddenly.</p> 
<p>He was leaning with his elbows on the table and his chin on his hands, looking into a futurity which seemed to be sketched out on the tablecloth.</p> 
<p>"Oh--nothing!"</p> 
<p>"You are 'father', you know. That's what they call the man who gives you away."</p> 
<p>Jude could have said "Phillotson's age entitles him to be called that!" But he would not annoy her by such a cheap retort.</p> 
<p>She talked incessantly, as if she dreaded his indulgence in reflection, and before the meal was over both he and she wished they had not put such confidence in their new view of things, and had taken breakfast apart. What oppressed Jude was the thought that, having done a wrong thing of this sort himself, he was aiding and abetting the woman he loved in doing a like wrong thing, instead of imploring and warning her against it. It was on his tongue to say, "You have quite made up your mind?"</p> 
<p>After breakfast they went out on an errand together moved by a mutual thought that it was the last opportunity they would have of indulging in unceremonious companionship. By the irony of fate, and the curious trick in Sue's nature of tempting Providence at critical times, she took his arm as they walked through the muddy street--a thing she had never done before in her life--and on turning the corner they found themselves close to a grey perpendicular church with a low-pitched roof-- the church of St. Thomas.</p> 
<p>"That's the church," said Jude.</p> 
<p>"Where I am going to be married?"</p> 
<p>"Yes."</p> 
<p>"Indeed!" she exclaimed with curiosity. "How I should like to go in and see what the spot is like where I am so soon to kneel and do it."</p> 
<p>Again he said to himself, "She does not realize what marriage means!"</p> 
<p>He passively acquiesced in her wish to go in, and they entered by the western door. The only person inside the gloomy building was a charwoman cleaning. Sue still held Jude's arm, almost as if she loved him. Cruelly sweet, indeed, she had been to him that morning; but his thoughts of a penance in store for her were tempered by an ache:</p> 
<p>... I can find no way How a blow should fall, such as falls on men, Nor prove too much for your womanhood!</p> 
<p>They strolled undemonstratively up the nave towards the altar railing, which they stood against in silence, turning then and walking down the nave again, her hand still on his arm, precisely like a couple just married. The too suggestive incident, entirely of her making, nearly broke down Jude.</p> 
<p>"I like to do things like this," she said in the delicate voice of an epicure in emotions, which left no doubt that she spoke the truth.</p> 
<p>"I know you do!" said Jude.</p> 
<p>"They are interesting, because they have probably never been done before. I shall walk down the church like this with my husband in about two hours, shan't I!"</p> 
<p>"No doubt you will!"</p> 
<p>"Was it like this when you were married?"</p> 
<p>"Good God, Sue--don't be so awfully merciless! ... There, dear one, I didn't mean it!"</p> 
<p>"Ah--you are vexed!" she said regretfully, as she blinked away an access of eye moisture. "And I promised never to vex you! ... I suppose I ought not to have asked you to bring me in here. Oh, I oughtn't! I see it now. My curiosity to hunt up a new sensation always leads me into these scrapes. Forgive me! ... You will, won't you, Jude?"</p> 
<p>The appeal was so remorseful that Jude's eyes were even wetter than hers as he pressed her hand for Yes.</p> 
<p>"Now we'll hurry away, and I won't do it any more!" she continued humbly; and they came out of the building, Sue intending to go on to the station to meet Phillotson. But the first person they encountered on entering the main street was the schoolmaster himself, whose train had arrived sooner than Sue expected. There was nothing really to demur to in her leaning on Jude's arm; but she withdrew her hand, and Jude thought that Phillotson had looked surprised.</p> 
<p>"We have been doing such a funny thing!" said she, smiling candidly. "We've been to the church, rehearsing as it were. Haven't we, Jude?"</p> 
<p>"How?" said Phillotson curiously.</p> 
<p>Jude inwardly deplored what he thought to be unnecessary frankness; but she had gone too far not to explain all, which she accordingly did, telling him how they had marched up to the altar.</p> 
<p>Seeing how puzzled Phillotson seemed, Jude said as cheerfully as he could, "I am going to buy her another little present. Will you both come to the shop with me?"</p> 
<p>"No," said Sue, "I'll go on to the house with him"; and requesting her lover not to be a long time she departed with the schoolmaster.</p> 
<p>Jude soon joined them at his rooms, and shortly after they prepared for the ceremony. Phillotson's hair was brushed to a painful extent, and his shirt collar appeared stiffer than it had been for the previous twenty years. Beyond this he looked dignified and thoughtful, and altogether a man of whom it was not unsafe to predict that he would make a kind and considerate husband. That he adored Sue was obvious; and she could almost be seen to feel that she was undeserving his adoration.</p> 
<p>Although the distance was so short he had hired a fly from the Red Lion, and six or seven women and children had gathered by the door when they came out. The schoolmaster and Sue were unknown, though Jude was getting to be recognized as a citizen; and the couple were judged to be some relations of his from a distance, nobody supposing Sue to have been a recent pupil at the training school.</p> 
<p>In the carriage Jude took from his pocket his extra little wedding-present, which turned out to be two or three yards of white tulle, which he threw over her bonnet and all, as a veil.</p> 
<p>"It looks so odd over a bonnet," she said. "I'll take the bonnet off."</p> 
<p>"Oh no--let it stay," said Phillotson. And she obeyed.</p> 
<p>When they had passed up the church and were standing in their places Jude found that the antecedent visit had certainly taken off the edge of this performance, but by the time they were half-way on with the service he wished from his heart that he had not undertaken the business of giving her away. How could Sue have had the temerity to ask him to do it-- a cruelty possibly to herself as well as to him? Women were different from men in such matters. Was it that they were, instead of more sensitive, as reputed, more callous, and less romantic; or were they more heroic? Or was Sue simply so perverse that she wilfully gave herself and him pain for the odd and mournful luxury of practising long-suffering in her own person, and of being touched with tender pity for him at having made him practise it? He could perceive that her face was nervously set, and when they reached the trying ordeal of Jude giving her to Phillotson she could hardly command herself; rather, however, as it seemed, from her knowledge of what her cousin must feel, whom she need not have had there at all, than from self-consideration. Possibly she would go on inflicting such pains again and again, and grieving for the sufferer again and again, in all her colossal inconsistency.</p> 
<p>Phillotson seemed not to notice, to be surrounded by a mist which prevented his seeing the emotions of others. As soon as they had signed their names and come away, and the suspense was over, Jude felt relieved.</p> 
<p>The meal at his lodging was a very simple affair, and at two o'clock they went off. In crossing the pavement to the fly she looked back; and there was a frightened light in her eyes. Could it be that Sue had acted with such unusual foolishness as to plunge into she knew not what for the sake of asserting her independence of him, of retaliating on him for his secrecy? Perhaps Sue was thus venturesome with men because she was childishly ignorant of that side of their natures which wore out women's hearts and lives.</p> 
<p>When her foot was on the carriage-step she turned round, saying that she had forgotten something. Jude and the landlady offered to get it.</p> 
<p>"No," she said, running back. "It is my handkerchief. I know where I left it."</p> 
<p>Jude followed her back. She had found it, and came holding it in her hand. She looked into his eyes with her own tearful ones, and her lips suddenly parted as if she were going to avow something. But she went on; and whatever she had meant to say remained unspoken.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>一两天后，苏的信到了，犹如一阵摧毁万物的恶风猛撼着裘德。</p> 
<p>他还没看信的内容，先一眼瞧见了她的签字，是她一本正经写的姓名全称，不简不缩，她从头一封信起，向来没这样用过。</p> 
<p>我的亲爱的裘德：现有一事奉告，谅你得悉后当不为意外，不过你难免顿生速度加快（铁路公司的火车用语）之感。费乐生先生和我很快就要结婚，约在三四个礼拜之后。你当然知道，我们原意是先要等我完成进修，领到文凭，并且如有必要，能以协助他教学，此后再办结婚之事。但是他慷慨表示，既然我已不在进修学校就读，似无再等下去之理。这实属他的美意，因为我确实由于一时不慎，致遭开除，处境十分困难。</p> 
<p>给我道喜吧。务必记住我要你这样做，不得拒绝！你的亲爱的表亲</p> 
<p>苏珊娜·弗洛仑·马利·柏瑞和</p> 
<p>这个消息对他真是五雷轰顶；他吃不下饭，口干舌燥，拼命喝茶。过了会儿，他就去上班了，也跟所有碰到这类情况的人一样，大声发出苦笑。万事万物似乎都在跟他作对。然而他又自问：可怜的姑娘不这样，又能怎么办？他觉得自己就是痛哭流涕，也于事无补。</p> 
<p>“唉，苏珊娜·弗洛仑·马利呀！”他一边干活一边说。“你可不知道结婚是什么滋味哟！”</p> 
<p>上回他醉醺醺跑到她那儿去，逼得她订了婚，难道这一回因为他对她讲了自己结婚的事，又逼得她走这一步吗？不错，说不定还有实际的和社会的因素促成她的决定。不过苏才不是个重实际、使心眼的人哪。他不能不认为，是他吐露的秘密对她是如此意外，因而她才在盛怒之下，给费乐生的并无把握的请求开了方便之门，并且要证明学校当局的谰言纯属无稽之谈，像一般履行婚约那样，跟费乐生仓卒结婚是顶好的办法。实际上，苏已经被逼得走投无路了。可怜的苏呀！</p> 
<p>他决心扮演侠客角色；为给她撑腰，一定要演得淋漓尽致。不过他还是有一两天没法接她的请求写信表示良好的祝愿。而这会儿，他那可爱的小宝贝儿却耐不住了，又来了一封信：</p> 
<p>裘德：你愿不愿为我主婚？我在此地别无他人能像你办这样的事那么方便合适，因为你是我在此地的唯一已婚亲属。即使我父亲的态度好了起来，有这么个意思，实际上他也不肯办。我在祈祷书里看过结婚仪式中一节，无论如何总得有主婚人在场，我觉得真是出洋相。据那上面印的仪文说，我的新郎是按他的意愿和爱好选中了我，可我不是选中他。是某个人替我做主，把我交给了他，我就跟一头母驴或一头母羊，或者别的什么家畜一样。啊，教会的使者哟，敬祝你对人的见解那么超群迈众哟！可是我又忘了，我无权再返你玩啦！——永久的</p> 
<p>苏珊娜·弗洛仑·马利·柏瑞和</p> 
<p>裘德一咬牙，亮出了英雄气概，回信说：</p> 
<p>我的亲爱的苏，我当然给你道喜，当然也当你的主婚人。我提个建议，你现在既然没你的住所，你就从我的住所，而不是你的朋友的地方，出门子吧。我认为这样做比较恰当，因为如你所说，我是你在世界上这块地方最近的亲人哪。</p> 
<p>我不懂何以你在信末签名用那么一种又新鲜而又郑重得肉麻的方式？的确你至少还想着我一点点呢。——永远是你的亲爱的</p> 
<p>裘德</p> 
<p>其实他感到尤为刺心的倒不仅仅是她的署名方式，而是他对之保持缄默的所谓“已婚的亲属”的说法——她把他这人这么一形容，弄得他简直像个二百五了。如果她这样写是意在讽刺，他很难原谅她；如果是因为苦恼不堪——那又当别论啦！</p> 
<p>他提出用他的住所无论如何博得了费乐生的赞许，因为小学教师寄来一封短简，对他热烈地表示谢意，接受了这个权宜办法。苏也向他道谢。裘德立即迁人一个比较宽敞的公寓，他之所以换地方是为避开那位疑神疑鬼的房东太太的窥伺，因为她正是造成苏的倒霉的经历的起因。</p> 
<p>接着苏来信告诉她婚礼日期已定。经过打听，裘德决定要她下礼拜六来住那个地方，也就可以在婚礼前在镇内居留十天。对法定婚前应居留十五天的期限，名义上完全可以马虎充数了。</p> 
<p>她那天乘上午十点钟火车到达，根据她的要求，他没去车站接她，因为她说他不必因此白白误半天工，少拿半天工资（假定她这个理由果真），但是他此时此刻对苏了解如此之深，知道她这是由于前一阵感情纠葛的危机所引起的相互之间的过敏反应，在她是记忆犹新，影响犹在，只好出此一策。他到家吃饭的时候，看见她已经在自己的居室安顿就绪。</p> 
<p>她同他住同一所房子，但楼层不同，彼此极少见面，偶然在～块儿吃晚饭，仅此而已。苏的神情像一个受惊的孩子。他不了解她心里什么感觉；他们的谈话纯属敷衍性质；不过她脸色并不苍白，也不像不舒服。费乐生常来，大多乘裘德不在家的时候。婚礼那天，裘德给自己放了一天假，苏和她的表亲，在这个希奇的短暂过渡期，头一回，也是最后一回，在一块儿吃早饭。饭是在他的屋子（小起坐室）里吃的，他是因为苏住在这儿，才临时租了这间屋子。跟所有女人一样，她一眼就看出来，要把它收拾得舒舒服服，他是无能为力的，于是她风风火火地给他整理了一番。</p> 
<p>“你怎么啦，裘德？”她突然说。</p> 
<p>他胳臂肘支在桌子上，手托着下巴颏，眼盯着桌布，仿佛上面画出来一幅飘渺的未来景象。</p> 
<p>“哦——没事儿！”</p> 
<p>“你知道，你现在是‘爸爸’啦。凡是主婚人，人家都这么叫他。”</p> 
<p>裘德本想说“费乐生的年纪才够格让人叫爸爸呢！”可是他不想这么庸俗地抵她。</p> 
<p>她话说得没完没了，好像她生怕裘德一味陷入沉思。饭没吃完，两个人都觉得在这新局面下装得那么安之若素太没意思，于是各到一边去吃了。裘德心里倍感沉重，因为他不断在想自己当初做过这类错事，如今他不单没恳求她、警告她别干这样的事，反而帮助和鼓励自己爱的人做同样的错事。他欲言又止，“你真是拿定了主意吗？”</p> 
<p>早饭后，他们一块儿外出，他们的心也想到一块儿了，因为这是他们最后一次能随心所欲，不因俗礼而拘泥的相伴活动的机会。既是命运的捉弄，也因为苏天性爱在严重的转折关头，开点玩笑，侮慢神明，所以她就挽起了裘德的胳臂一路走过泥泞的街道——她这样做还是这辈子头一回呢——转过街角，他们发现走到了一座屋顶缓斜的灰色垂直式教堂——圣·托马斯教堂前面。</p> 
<p>“就是那座教堂。”裘德说。</p> 
<p>“我就在那儿结婚？”</p> 
<p>“对。”</p> 
<p>“真是呀！”她由于好奇心驱使大声喊叫出来。“我可真想进去开开眼，瞧瞧我待会儿就跪下来行礼的地方什么样。”</p> 
<p>他再次对自己说，“她还不知道结婚什么滋味呢！”</p> 
<p>他莫奈何只好顺从她要进去的愿望，就从教堂西门进去了。教堂内部光线暗淡，只有一个女工在打扫。她仍然挽着他，简直跟爱他一样。那个早晨，她对他那么甜蜜，而甜蜜中含有残酷意味。他想到她终将有后悔的一天，不禁心痛难忍，更觉不堪：</p> 
<p>……我无从感受也无从验证</p> 
<p>落在男人头上的打击，一旦降临</p> 
<p>你们女子身上，是何等样沉重！</p> 
<p>他们毫无表情地缓步走向中殿，到了圣坛栏杆旁，凭倚栏杆，在一片沉寂中站着，然后转身从中殿走回来。她的手仍然挽着他的胳臂，俨然刚成婚的夫妇。这个活动全由她一手操持，其中有太多的暗示意味，令裘德差不多撑不下去了。</p> 
<p>“我喜欢来这么一遍。”她说，因为情感上得到了充分的满足，声音是那么宛转、娇柔，而她的话是真情，那是绝对无疑的。</p> 
<p>“我知道你喜欢啊！”裘德说。</p> 
<p>“这倒怪有意思呢，因为别人从前都没这么来过呀。大概过两个钟头，我就跟我丈夫这样走过教堂吧，不是吗？”</p> 
<p>“一定这样，毫无疑问！”</p> 
<p>“你结婚时候就这样？”</p> 
<p>“天哪，苏啊——你可别厉害到这么歹毒啊！……唉，亲爱的，我本来是不想这么说哟！”</p> 
<p>“哦，你气啦！”她带着悔意说，一边眨眨眼，不让眼泪掉下来。“我不是答应再不叫你生气吗？……我想我真不该叫你把我带到这里边来。哦，我太不该啦！我这会儿明白过来啦。我的好奇心老叫我找刺激，结果就弄得自己下不了台啦。原谅我吧！……裘德呀，你原谅还是不原谅呢？”</p> 
<p>她的求恕满含着悔恨，裘德握紧了她的手，表示原谅，自己的眼睛比她的还湿。</p> 
<p>“咱们这会儿得赶快出去，我不想再这么干啦！”她低声下气地继续说。于是他们走出教堂，苏要到车站接费乐生。可是他们刚走到街上，迎面来的头一个人恰好是小学教师，他坐的火车比苏要等的那趟要早些。她靠在裘德膀子上本来无可非议，不过她还是把手抽回来。裘德觉得费乐生一副吃惊的样子。</p> 
<p>“我们刚干了一件挺好笑的事儿！”她说，笑得那么坦荡。“我们到教堂去过啦，演习了一下，咱们不是演习过吗，裘德！”</p> 
<p>“怎么回事呀！”费乐生说，感到莫名其妙。</p> 
<p>裘德心里懊恼，认为她何必这么直言无隐，但是到了这地步，他也不好不解释，就把经过讲了讲，告诉他他们怎么齐步走向圣坛的。</p> 
<p>裘德一看费乐生惶恐不安，就尽可能高高兴兴说，“我还得去给她买件小礼物，你们跟我一块儿到店里去，好吗？”</p> 
<p>“不去啦，”苏说，“我得跟他回住的地方。”她要求她的情人别耽误太久，随即同小学教师一块儿走了。</p> 
<p>裘德很快回到自己家里，跟他们到了一块儿。过了会儿，他们开始做婚礼的准备。费乐生把头发刷来刷去，那样子叫人瞧着受不了。他把衬衫领子浆得那么硬，二十年来都没见过。不说这些，他外表庄重，富于思想，整个来看，说这个人是位脾气好、善体贴的丈夫，决不会有差池，不对路。他对苏的崇拜是明显的，不过看她的神气，倒像她觉着自己不配呢。</p> 
<p>虽然路挺近，裘德还是叫了辆红狮车行的轻便马车。他们出来时候，门口围着六七个女人和孩子。他们不知道小学教师和苏是何许人，不过他们已经慢慢拿裘德当本镇人了，又猜测那一对是他的外地来的亲戚，谁也料不到苏不久前还是进修学校学生呢。</p> 
<p>在马车里，他从衣袋里掏出来特意给她买的小贺礼，原来是两三码白纱。他把它整个蒙在她的帽子和身上当婚纱。</p> 
<p>“放在帽子上太怪模怪样的，”她说，“我要把帽子摘下来。”</p> 
<p>“哦，不必啦——这样挺好。”费乐生说。她听了他的话。</p> 
<p>他们进了教堂，站到自己的位置上，这时裘德却想到前面那回演习准把这回仪式的精神冲淡，可是他们行礼如仪到一半的时候，他满心不愿再充当主婚人角色。苏怎么会大发奇想叫他干这样的事呢？这不仅对他是件残酷事，对她自己何尝不一样残酷。女人在这类事情上就是跟男人不一样。难道她们并不像公认的那样比男人更敏感，而是感情更冷，更乏浪漫情趣吗？否则就是她们比男人还有胆气？莫非苏生性如此乖僻顽梗，不惜一意孤行，不惜痛彻肺腑，要练习长期受罪，把给她和他造成痛苦，当成一种享受；又因为把他牵进去受罪而于心不忍，对他不胜怜惜？他分明看到她脸上强作无动于衷，却难掩内心骚乱；及至裘德以主婚人身份把她交给费乐生那折磨人的一刻，她真是失魂落魄，难以支持下去了；但是看上去，这似乎不是她一心为自己着想，倒是因为她深知那位表亲心里是怎么一种滋味，而她本来就不该让他来啊。说不定而今而后因为她反复无常，颠倒错乱，将会屡屡加给他这样的痛苦，而她自己也将屡屡为因她而受罪的人悲伤欲绝。</p> 
<p>看来费乐生什么也没注意，他周围一层薄雾挡住了他的视线，看不到别人的情绪变化。他们一签好名就离开教堂，裘德不必再提心吊胆，一块石头总算落了地。</p> 
<p>在他的住处吃饭很简单，两点钟他们就动身了。在走过人行道去上马车的时候，她回头看了看，目光露出一丝惊恐。难道苏就是为了表示她不受他的影响，为了他向她保守秘密而蓄意报复，竟会以难得糊涂而投身前途莫测的生活吗？也许她对于男人满不在乎吧，其实她像小孩子一样无知，不了解男人天性中原来就有蚀耗女人的心灵和生命的那一面。</p> 
<p>她踏上了马车的踏板，忽然转过身，说她忘了样东西。裘德和房东都热心要替她去拿。</p> 
<p>“不成。”她说完就往回跑。“是我的手绢儿。我知道放在哪儿。”</p> 
<p>裘德跟她回去。她找到手绢，抓在手里，双目含泪凝视裘德的眼睛，突然丹唇微启，似欲有所表白。但是她走了，到底有什么难言之隐，终于没有透露。</p>
