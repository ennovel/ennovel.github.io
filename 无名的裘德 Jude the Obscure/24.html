They sat in the large school-room of the establishment on the evening previously described, and word was passed round that Sue Bridehead had not come in at closing-time.</p> 
<p>"She went out with her young man," said a second-year's student, who knew about young men. "And Miss Traceley saw her at the station with him. She'll have it hot when she does come."</p> 
<p>"She said he was her cousin," observed a youthful new girl.</p> 
<p>"That excuse has been made a little too often in this school to be effectual in saving our souls," said the head girl of the year, drily.</p> 
<p>The fact was that, only twelve months before, there had occurred a lamentable seduction of one of the pupils who had made the same statement in order to gain meetings with her lover. The affair had created a scandal, and the management had consequently been rough on cousins ever since.</p> 
<p>At nine o'clock the names were called, Sue's being pronounced three times sonorously by Miss Traceley without eliciting an answer.</p> 
<p>At a quarter past nine the seventy stood up to sing the "Evening Hymn," and then knelt down to prayers. After prayers they went in to supper, and every girl's thought was, Where is Sue Bridehead? Some of the students, who had seen Jude from the window, felt that they would not mind risking her punishment for the pleasure of being kissed by such a kindly-faced young men. Hardly one among them believed in the cousinship.</p> 
<p>Half an hour later they all lay in their cubicles, their tender feminine faces upturned to the flaring gas-jets which at intervals stretched down the long dormitories, every face bearing the legend "The Weaker" upon it, as the penalty of the sex wherein they were moulded, which by no possible exertion of their willing hearts and abilities could be made strong while the inexorable laws of nature remain what they are. They formed a pretty, suggestive, pathetic sight, of whose pathos and beauty they were themselves unconscious, and would not discover till, amid the storms and strains of after-years, with their injustice, loneliness, child-bearing, and bereavement, their minds would revert to this experience as to something which had been allowed to slip past them insufficiently regarded.</p> 
<p>One of the mistresses came in to turn out the lights, and before doing so gave a final glance at Sue's cot, which remained empty, and at her little dressing-table at the foot, which, like all the rest, was ornamented with various girlish trifles, framed photographs being not the least conspicuous among them. Sue's table had a moderate show, two men in their filigree and velvet frames standing together beside her looking-glass.</p> 
<p>"Who are these men--did she ever say?" asked the mistress. "Strictly speaking, relations' portraits only are allowed on these tables, you know."</p> 
<p>"One--the middle-aged man," said a student in the next bed--"is the schoolmaster she served under--Mr. Phillotson."</p> 
<p>"And the other--this undergraduate in cap and gown--who is he?"</p> 
<p>"He is a friend, or was. She has never told his name."</p> 
<p>"Was it either of these two who came for her?"</p> 
<p>"No."</p> 
<p>"You are sure 'twas not the undergraduate?"</p> 
<p>"Quite. He was a young man with a black beard."</p> 
<p>The lights were promptly extinguished, and till they fell asleep the girls indulged in conjectures about Sue, and wondered what games she had carried on in London and at Christminster before she came here, some of the more restless ones getting out of bed and looking from the mullioned windows at the vast west front of the cathedral opposite, and the spire rising behind it.</p> 
<p>When they awoke the next morning they glanced into Sue's nook, to find it still without a tenant. After the early lessons by gas-light, in half-toilet, and when they had come up to dress for breakfast, the bell of the entrance gate was heard to ring loudly. The mistress of the dormitory went away, and presently came back to say that the principal's orders were that nobody was to speak to Bridehead without permission.</p> 
<p>When, accordingly, Sue came into the dormitory to hastily tidy herself, looking flushed and tired, she went to her cubicle in silence, none of them coming out to greet her or to make inquiry. When they had gone downstairs they found that she did not follow them into the dining-hall to breakfast, and they then learnt that she had been severely reprimanded, and ordered to a solitary room for a week, there to be confined, and take her meals, and do all her reading.</p> 
<p>At this the seventy murmured, the sentence being, they thought, too severe. A round robin was prepared and sent in to the principal, asking for a remission of Sue's punishment. No notice was taken. Towards evening, when the geography mistress began dictating her subject, the girls in the class sat with folded arms.</p> 
<p>"You mean that you are not going to work?" said the mistress at last. "I may as well tell you that it has been ascertained that the young man Bridehead stayed out with was not her cousin, for the very good reason that she has no such relative. We have written to Christminster to ascertain."</p> 
<p>"We are willing to take her word," said the head girl.</p> 
<p>"This young man was discharged from his work at Christminster for drunkenness and blasphemy in public-houses, and he has come here to live, entirely to be near her."</p> 
<p>However, they remained stolid and motionless, and the mistress left the room to inquire from her superiors what was to be done.</p> 
<p>Presently, towards dusk, the pupils, as they sat, heard exclamations from the first-year's girls in an adjoining classroom, and one rushed in to say that Sue Bridehead had got out of the back window of the room in which she had been confined, escaped in the dark across the lawn, and disappeared. How she had managed to get out of the garden nobody could tell, as it was bounded by the river at the bottom, and the side door was locked.</p> 
<p>They went and looked at the empty room, the casement between the middle mullions of which stood open. The lawn was again searched with a lantern, every bush and shrub being examined, but she was nowhere hidden. Then the porter of the front gate was interrogated, and on reflection he said that he remembered hearing a sort of splashing in the stream at the back, but he had taken no notice, thinking some ducks had come down the river from above.</p> 
<p>"She must have walked through the river!" said a mistress.</p> 
<p>"Or drownded herself," said the porter.</p> 
<p>The mind of the matron was horrified--not so much at the possible death of Sue as at the possible half-column detailing that event in all the newspapers, which, added to the scandal of the year before, would give the college an unenviable notoriety for many months to come.</p> 
<p>More lanterns were procured, and the river examined; and then, at last, on the opposite shore, which was open to the fields, some little boot-tracks were discerned in the mud, which left no doubt that the too excitable girl had waded through a depth of water reaching nearly to her shoulders-- for this was the chief river of the county, and was mentioned in all the geography books with respect. As Sue had not brought disgrace upon the school by drowning herself, the matron began to speak superciliously of her, and to express gladness that she was gone.</p> 
<p>On the self-same evening Jude sat in his lodgings by the Close Gate. Often at this hour after dusk he would enter the silent Close, and stand opposite the house that contained Sue, and watch the shadows of the girls' heads passing to and fro upon the blinds, and wish he had nothing else to do but to sit reading and learning all day what many of the thoughtless inmates despised. But to-night, having finished tea and brushed himself up, he was deep in the perusal of the Twenty-ninth Volume of Pusey's Library of the Fathers, a set of books which he had purchased of a second-hand dealer at a price that seemed to him to be one of miraculous cheapness for that invaluable work. He fancied he heard something rattle lightly against his window; then he heard it again. Certainly somebody had thrown gravel. He rose and gently lifted the sash.</p> 
<p>"Jude!" (from below).</p> 
<p>"Sue!"</p> 
<p>"Yes--it is! Can I come up without being seen?"</p> 
<p>"Oh yes!"</p> 
<p>"Then don't come down. Shut the window."</p> 
<p>Jude waited, knowing that she could enter easily enough, the front door being opened merely by a knob which anybody could turn, as in most old country towns. He palpitated at the thought that she had fled to him in her trouble as he had fled to her in his. What counterparts they were! He unlatched the door of his room, heard a stealthy rustle on the dark stairs, and in a moment she appeared in the light of his lamp. He went up to seize her hand, and found she was clammy as a marine deity, and that her clothes clung to her like the robes upon the figures in the Parthenon frieze.</p> 
<p>"I'm so cold!" she said through her chattering teeth. "Can I come by your fire, Jude?"</p> 
<p>She crossed to his little grate and very little fire, but as the water dripped from her as she moved, the idea of drying herself was absurd. "Whatever have you done, darling?" he asked, with alarm, the tender epithet slipping out unawares.</p> 
<p>"Walked through the largest river in the county--that's what I've done! They locked me up for being out with you; and it seemed so unjust that I couldn't bear it, so I got out of the window and escaped across the stream!" She had begun the explanation in her usual slightly independent tones, but before she had finished the thin pink lips trembled, and she could hardly refrain from crying.</p> 
<p>"Dear Sue!" he said. "You must take off all your things! And let me see--you must borrow some from the landlady. I'll ask her."</p> 
<p>"No, no! Don't let her know, for God's sake! We are so near the school that they'll come after me!"</p> 
<p>"Then you must put on mine. You don't mind?"</p> 
<p>"Oh no."</p> 
<p>"My Sunday suit, you know. It is close here." In fact, everything was close and handy in Jude's single chamber, because there was not room for it to be otherwise. He opened a drawer, took out his best dark suit, and giving the garments a shake, said, "Now, how long shall I give you?"</p> 
<p>"Ten minutes."</p> 
<p>Jude left the room and went into the street, where he walked up and down. A clock struck half-past seven, and he returned. Sitting in his only arm-chair he saw a slim and fragile being masquerading as himself on a Sunday, so pathetic in her defencelessness that his heart felt big with the sense of it. On two other chairs before the fire were her wet garments. She blushed as he sat down beside her, but only for a moment.</p> 
<p>"I suppose, Jude, it is odd that you should see me like this and all my things hanging there? Yet what nonsense! They are only a woman's clothes--sexless cloth and linen.... I wish I didn't feel so ill and sick! Will you dry my clothes now? Please do, Jude, and I'll get a lodging by and by. It is not late yet."</p> 
<p>"No, you shan't, if you are ill. You must stay here. Dear, dear Sue, what can I get for you?"</p> 
<p>"I don't know! I can't help shivering. I wish I could get warm." Jude put on her his great-coat in addition, and then ran out to the nearest public-house, whence he returned with a little bottle in his hand. "Here's six of best brandy," he said. "Now you drink it, dear; all of it."</p> 
<p>"I can't out of the bottle, can I?" Jude fetched the glass from the dressing-table, and administered the spirit in some water. She gasped a little, but gulped it down, and lay back in the armchair.</p> 
<p>She then began to relate circumstantially her experiences since they had parted; but in the middle of her story her voice faltered, her head nodded, and she ceased. She was in a sound sleep. Jude, dying of anxiety lest she should have caught a chill which might permanently injure her, was glad to hear the regular breathing. He softly went nearer to her, and observed that a warm flush now rosed her hitherto blue cheeks, and felt that her hanging hand was no longer cold. Then he stood with his back to the fire regarding her, and saw in her almost a divinity.</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>在现在说到的这段时间，麦尔切斯特人所共知的师资培训学校等于一个变相的女修道院。它收纳了七十名年轻妇女，年纪大致从十九到二十一岁不等，也有几个要大些。她们构成了一个流品十分混杂的群体，其中有技工、副牧师、外科医生、店老板、庄稼汉、牛奶场工人、兵士、水手和乡下佬的女儿。前面提到的那晚上，她们都坐在大教室里，彼此之间递着话，无非议论苏为什么到关校门时还没回校。</p> 
<p>“她跟她那个小伙子一块儿出去的。”二年级一个女生说，她跟小伙子们多有往来。“屈思黎小姐在车站瞧见她跟他在一块儿。她回来的时候，她要不收拾她一顿才怪呢。”</p> 
<p>“她说那人是她表亲。”一年级一个岁数小的新生说。</p> 
<p>“在这学校里头，拿这个打掩护，算老掉牙啦。它帮不了咱们，也救不了咱们。”二年级级长说，口气冷冷的。</p> 
<p>她这样说是因为不过十二个月前，学校里出了件令人痛心的女生遭到诱奸的案件。那个学生就是用类似的托词去跟情人约会。这事成了轰动一时的丑闻，所以训育处从此对什么表亲关系决不通融。</p> 
<p>九点钟点名，屈思黎小姐把苏的名字响亮地喊了三遍，但是没人应声。</p> 
<p>九点半，七十个女生站起来齐声唱《夕颂》，然后跪下祈祷，祈祷完了就去吃饭，人人心里嚼咕：苏·柏瑞和跑哪儿去啦？有些学生曾经隔着窗子瞧见过裘德，心里想要是能得到这长得斯文和善的小伙子一吻之乐，哪怕受到处分也在所不惜。她们谁也不信他们是表亲。</p> 
<p>半个钟头以后，她们各自回到小隔间躺下来，娇嫩的女儿脸朝上望，对着汽灯一蹿一蹿的光舌，它间断地把亮光散布到长形宿舍四隅。她们脸上无不带着“弱者”的烙印，这是她们因生为女儿身而逃脱不掉的惩罚。只要狠戾无情的自然法则长此不变，她们再怎么无微不至地尽心竭力，也休想变弱为强。她们形成的那幅群像，面容姣好，楚楚动人，掩抑着哀怨，至于其中所含的悲和美，她们自己并无所感受；只有在狂风暴雨和艰难辛苦的生活中受尽委屈，尝遍孤寂，生儿育女，侍死送终，才会回想起这段经历，不免怪自己当年何等怠慢轻忽，竟任它随便流逝。</p> 
<p>一位女教师进来熄灯，稍后她还瞄了最后一眼苏的小窝，那里还是空着。她床头小梳妆台上，跟别人一样，摆着女孩子喜爱的这样那样的小玩意儿，镶框子的相片总不免比别的东西惹眼。苏的台上放的东西不算多，用金丝和平绒编成的框子镶着两张男人相片，并排放在她的镜子旁边。</p> 
<p>“那两个男的是谁——她说过没有？”女教师问。“严格地说，只许家里人相片放在台子上，这你们知道。”</p> 
<p>“一个——就是中年的那个。”邻床一个女生说。“是她帮教课的小学老师——费乐生先生。”</p> 
<p>“那个呢——那个戴方帽、穿袍子的大学生，他是什么人？”</p> 
<p>“是朋友，以前的朋友吧。她没说过他叫什么。”</p> 
<p>“他们谁来看过她？”</p> 
<p>“都没来过。”</p> 
<p>“你肯定找她的不是那个大学生？”</p> 
<p>“完全肯定。找她的是个留黑胡子的小伙子。”</p> 
<p>灯马上熄了，她们没睡着之前，任情想象着苏的来龙去脉，纳闷她在到这儿之前在伦敦和基督堂都搞了什么名堂。有几个更是坐卧不安，从床上下来，扒着直棂窗，望着大教堂的阔大的西正面和它后面耸起的塔楼。</p> 
<p>第二天早晨一觉醒来，她们先朝苏的小窝看，发现还是没人。大致梳洗了一下，她们就在汽灯光下上早自习，然后穿戴齐整去吃早饭。忽然听见大门铃声大作，女舍监出去了，不过很快又回来，吩咐说校长有命，未经许可，谁都不许同苏·柏瑞和过话。</p> 
<p>这时候，也势必如此，苏进了宿舍，脸透着红，人显得累，匆忙梳洗了一下，就一声也没吱地走到自己小隔间。她们谁也没出来跟她打招呼，也没人问她怎么回事。下楼时候，都没看见她跟着大家一块儿上饭厅吃早饭，接着就听说她受到严厉的申斥，命令她住到一个单室，关一个礼拜禁闭，单独吃饭，只许一个人看书学习。</p> 
<p>七十个女生对这个消息七嘴八舌议论起来。她们认为如此处罚未免太过严厉，于是全体准备好一份绕着圈儿签名的请愿书，呈送校长，要求豁免对苏的处分。校方对此置之不理。向晚时，教地理的女老师开始在课上要求听写，但全班个个把胳臂往胸前一抱，端坐不动。</p> 
<p>“你们这是不想做作业喽？”女教师最后只好说。“我倒可以告诉你们，现在已经查清楚了，柏瑞和那个跟她一块儿呆在外头不回来的小男人不是她表亲，因为道理明白不过，她根本没这样的亲戚。我们已经写信到基督堂查实过。”</p> 
<p>“我们可全愿意信她说的。”级长说。</p> 
<p>“那年轻男人在基督堂的酒馆里酗酒读神，叫人家辞掉啦，他到这儿来住，全是为挨着她近点。”</p> 
<p>但是她们仍旧不加理睬，一动不动，女教师只好离开教室，向上级请示怎么办。</p> 
<p>快到黄昏的时候，学生仍在原地坐着。忽然紧挨着的一年级教室吵吵嚷嚷，一个女生从那边冲进来说，苏·柏瑞和从关她禁闭的屋子的后窗跑出去，摸黑穿过草坪，逃得没影了。她到底想出什么办法从校园逃出去，谁也说不出所以然，因为校园顶那头有条河拦着，再说旁门也上了锁。</p> 
<p>她们都到那间空屋子看，但见靠当中的直棂窗之间的窗槅开着。她们又打着灯笼到草坪上搜了一遍，凡是杂树林灌木丛都仔细搜到了，还是踪影全无。后来只好把前边大门门房叫来查问，他回想了一下说，他记得听见过后边水里什么噗喇噗喇声，可是没怎么注意，当是几个鸭子从岸上跳河里去了。</p> 
<p>“苏别是膛水过了河吧！”一位女教师说。</p> 
<p>“要不然就是投水自尽啦。”门房说。</p> 
<p>女合监心里一紧——她倒不是因为苏可能死掉，而是担心所有报纸可能用半个版篇幅大事报道这个事件。去年的丑闻再加这个，势必弄得学校好几个月谁也不羡慕地臭名远扬。</p> 
<p>她们又想法弄来一些灯笼，再沿河仔细查看一遍，最后还是在对岸接着麦田的烂泥地里分辨出矮帮鞋的小脚印，于是没什么疑问了。原来那个受不了刺激的女生膛着齐肩深的水过了河——说来那是郡里主要河流，所有地理课本都郑重介绍它呢。由于苏没投水自尽，也就不会弄得学校丢人现眼，女舍监于是凶神恶煞一般口出狂言，肆意糟蹋了苏一番，对苏的离去，深表高兴。</p> 
<p>那天晚上，裘德按老习惯坐在界园旁家里桌边。在黄昏后这个时辰，他常常到安谧的界园里，站在苏关禁闭的房子对面，望着窗帘上晃来晃去的女生脑袋的影子，但愿他也能像她们成天价无所事事，就是坐着看书、学习；其实那些同宿的不动脑筋的女生中间反而有很多瞧不起这样呢。恰好那晚上，他吃完茶点，刷掉身上的灰尘，就耽读普赛编辑的早期基督教作家著作丛刊第二十九卷，细心玩味；这套书是从一家旧书店买到手的，价格之廉宜，同这无价之宝的著作相比，真是近乎离奇。他恍惚觉着听见什么东西砸了他的窗户，哗啦一下，声很小；接着又响了一下。准是什么人扔了小石子。他站起来，轻轻地把窗框推上去。</p> 
<p>“裘德！”（下边来的声音。）</p> 
<p>“苏吗！”</p> 
<p>“是我——就是我！能上来吗，没人看见吧？”</p> 
<p>“哦，行！”</p> 
<p>“你别下来，把窗子拉下来。”</p> 
<p>裘德等着，知道她能很容易进来，前门有个把手，只要一转，门就开了。大多数乡下老市镇的街门都这样，所以谁都能把门开开。想到她碰到麻烦就往他这儿跑，跟他从前碰到麻烦跑到她那儿一样，裘德不禁心头小鹿乱撞。他们可真是一对儿啊！他把屋子的插销拉开，听见黑暗的楼梯上一阵偷偷摸摸的窸窣声，一下子她在他的灯光下出现了。他走过去抓住她的手，只见她浑身湿淋淋，真像个海中仙子，衣服紧巴在身上，跟帕特农神殿廊柱中媚的众雕像的袍子一样。</p> 
<p>“我真冷哟！”她上牙打下牙地说。“裘德，我就到你火炉边上，好吧？”</p> 
<p>她往里走到他那一点小炉火旁边，但是一动，水就从身上滴下来，要叫她自己把身上弄干未免不近情理。“你这是怎么搞的，亲亲？”他问，非常惊恐，说话间，温柔的词儿脱口而出。</p> 
<p>“打郡里那条最大的河蹚水过来的——就是这么回事儿！他们因为我跟你一块儿出去，就把我锁起来啦，太不讲道理啦，实在受不了，我就打窗户里头爬到外面，蹚着水，逃出来啦！”她开始用平常有点桀骛不驯的口气说明经过，不过没说完，她的薄薄嘴唇就颤动起来，勉强忍住才没哭。</p> 
<p>“亲爱的苏呀，你得把这身东西全脱下来才行啊。我想想看——你得跟房东太太借点衣服穿才行。我去跟她说说。”</p> 
<p>“不行，不行！看在上帝分儿上，你千万别让她知道！要不然，咱们离学校这么近，他们就要来逮我啦！”</p> 
<p>“那你只好穿我的啦。你不在乎吧？”</p> 
<p>“没关系。”</p> 
<p>“就穿我礼拜天那套，就在手边上。”其实在裘德这仅有的单间内什么都在手边上，因为也没有别的地方放东西，所以方便得很。他拉开抽屉，取出他顶好的套装，抖了抖，说，“好啦，你要多大工夫？”</p> 
<p>“十分钟吧。”</p> 
<p>裘德离开屋子到街上，在那儿徘徊；钟打七点半，就回去了。他瞧见一个瘦小、单薄的人儿坐在他仅有的安乐椅上，穿着他的礼拜天服装，打扮得像他礼拜天那样，孤苦伶什，难以自保，这样的感受叫他的心都胀痛了。她的潮衣服挂在炉火前两把椅子上。他在她旁边的椅子上坐下来的时候，她羞红了脸，不过一霎间就过去了。</p> 
<p>“裘德，我想你瞧我这样，再搭上挂在那儿的衣服，准觉着太异怪吧？可这是废话！不过是个女人的衣服嘛——棉布跟亚麻哪儿来的性别呢。……我可希望别病，别这么撑不住！请你就把我的衣服烘干了，行不行？裘德，帮帮忙吧。我得到附近找个地方住，这会儿还不算晚。”</p> 
<p>“不行，你可别这样，万一你病了怎么办？你就呆在这儿。亲爱的、亲爱的苏，还要我干什么？”</p> 
<p>“我也不知道！我可禁不住直哆嗦，就想暖和点。”裘德把自己的大衣加到她身上，接着跑到附近酒馆，回来时候拿着个小瓶子。“这是六便士的上好白兰地。”他说。“你马上喝了，亲爱的，都喝了。”</p> 
<p>“我对着瓶嘴喝行吗，不好吧？”裘德把杯子拿到梳妆桌上，倒进酒，又加了点水。她有点喘，可是一咕嘟就把酒喝光了，人往安乐椅上一靠。</p> 
<p>她开始详尽地叙述他们分手后自己的遭遇，但说到中间，声音就不大接气了，脑袋一点一点的，接着就说不下去了。她睡得很香。裘德原怕她感受风寒，弄得一辈子受罪，不由得急得要死，这会儿听见她呼吸平匀，就高兴起来。他轻手蹑脚走到她身边，见她原来发青的脸颊此刻泛出了血色，再摸摸她耷拉下来的手，也不凉了。然后他背着火，眼光没离开她，心想她简直是尊女神。</p>
