NED AT A DISADVANTAGE.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      Reconnoitering cautiously from his point of vantage behind the bush, Ned could not suppress a start of surprise.
<br> 
<br> There was something familiar about the figure of the fellow he was watching. Could it be——? Ned rubbed his eyes and looked again. Then his lips came together in a firm, thin line. His eyes hardened and his hands clenched.
<br> 
<br> "The infernal rascal!" he muttered.
<br> 
<br> He had not been mistaken when he thought he recognized the figure that was watching the tug as, with its crane stretched out like a long pointing finger, it steamed out into the center of the bay.
<br> 
<br> It was Midshipman Kenworth—Kenworth, whom he supposed was visiting his relatives far[Pg 114] inshore. Yet here he was in civilian clothes on this lonesome, sandy spit of land, apparently as much interested in the movements of the army tug as Ned himself.
<br> 
<br> What could be the solution of the mystery? Why had Kenworth come there?
<br> 
<br> A sinister thought flashed into Ned's mind. The next instant suspicion became conviction. He saw Kenworth draw out a pair of binoculars and focus them on the moving tug. Then the midshipman cast himself down into a sandy hollow, over the breast of which he pointed his binoculars at the tug.
<br> 
<br> "So-o-o-o! That's your little game, is it!" breathed Ned disgustedly. "You're even blacker than I thought you, Kenworth. I guess I'll take a hand in this thing myself. Bagging a traitor to Uncle Sam, and one who is entitled to wear the uniform of an officer and a gentleman at that, ought to be even more important than a chart of the mine positions."
<br> 
<br> [Pg 115]
<br> 
<br> Between the two, like a series of billows, stretched wave-like sand dunes. They were covered with a scant growth of wind-tortured beach plum and stiff, spiky sea grass.
<br> 
<br> But yet the growth, scant as it was, afforded a certain amount of cover. Ned's mind was soon made up as to the course he would pursue. At all hazards, it was important to catch Kenworth red-handed.
<br> 
<br> "And yet, what can his motive be?" wondered Ned to himself. "I can't conceive his purpose. He cannot be making his plans and observations for the benefit of the Blue fleet. If he dared offer them there, he would be booted over the flagship's side in two shakes. No, there is something under all this that I haven't fathomed. But I will."
<br> 
<br> Ned's firm chin closed on his jaw with a snap. With stern purpose in his eyes, the young follower of the flag began to creep forward over the billowing sand dunes.
<br> 
<br> [Pg 116]
<br> 
<br> His progress was slow, for although in the hollows he had no fear of being seen, yet when he breasted a rise he had to be careful. It was when he had attained the summit of one of these sandy acclivities that Ned noticed that the tug had come to a standstill.
<br> 
<br> The crane arm swung inboard and one of the mines, looking like a huge black shoe button, was slowly hoisted from the pile on the deck. Then through the still air came the rattling sound of chains and the shrieking whir of the steam winch as the mine was lowered.
<br> 
<br> From this, Ned turned his attention once more to Kenworth. The midshipman was squatting down in his hollow now, and with a note book on his knees, was recording some sort of observations.
<br> 
<br> Risking detection, Ned centered his binoculars on that note book. What he saw through the powerful lenses caused him to flush angrily. Kenworth was making, not without considerable[Pg 117] draughtsman's skill, a sketch map of the whole situation.
<br> 
<br> "Oh! you miserable wretch!" exclaimed Ned, gritting his teeth. "I'd give a whole lot to get my hands on you for about five minutes, and that's just what I'm going to do, too."
<br> 
<br> All unconscious of the concealed watcher, Kenworth sketched on. He actually appeared to take a pride in his work, from time to time holding it at arm's length as if to get a better perspective upon it. Then from his pocket he took a small camera, and made some pictures of the two forts and the stretch of water between.
<br> 
<br> "Great heavens! He's risking the loss of his commission," exclaimed Ned to himself as he saw. "There must be some uncommon motive behind all this to make him take such chances. What can it be?"
<br> 
<br> The tug was moving now, crawling like some ungainly black bug across the shimmering water.
<br> 
<br> Once more the anchor rumbled down, and[Pg 118] again the crane poised, swooped, and deposited another of the globular black objects, piled on the fore-deck, in the water.
<br> 
<br> Ned, watching Kenworth intently, saw him place a surveyor's instrument to his eye, no doubt to make a rough calculation of the exact spot of the planting. Following a few seconds' observation through this, he jotted down some more notes in his book.
<br> 
<br> "He's taking pains to be quite accurate," thought Ned. "He goes about his work as if it were some honorable duty he was engaged upon. I wonder how he knew about the mine planting, though? Can it be possible that he heard the message coming over the wireless, or in some manner gained access to a copy of it?"
<br> 
<br> Loyalty to his flag and country was the Dreadnought Boy's ruling passion. The sight of Kenworth, engaged upon what Ned was certain could only be treacherous work, sent a flame that seethed like a white-hot blast through his frame.
<br> 
<br> [Pg 119]
<br> 
<br> Again he moved forward, but faster now. Kenworth, all unconscious that another was creeping up on him, resumed his seat in the hollow and went on with the touching up of his rough drawings.
<br> 
<br> Ned was close upon him now. Through the grass he glided along like a snake.
<br> 
<br> But the rustle of some of the stiff grass behind him, or the fall of a miniature cascade of sand into his hollow, must have suddenly apprised Kenworth that somebody was in the vicinity.
<br> 
<br> He sprang to his feet and looked about him. At the same instant something leaped through the air with the speed of a thunderbolt.
<br> 
<br> With a roar of rage, Ned had sprung the instant that he saw that discovery was inevitable.
<br> 
<br> A sharp exclamation broke from Kenworth.
<br> 
<br> "You fool, I was prepared for you!"
<br> 
<br> Simultaneously something flashed bright in his hand, glinting in the sunlight.
<br> 
<br> The next instant Ned felt a hot flash of fire[Pg 120] in his face and the stinging of a shower of needles. He staggered back, his hands to his eyes, as Kenworth, with a cry of triumph, sprang toward the Dreadnought Boy's reeling figure.
<br> 
<br> "That's the time I got you, Mister Strong!" he exclaimed.
