<br> 
<br> Ned gasped out the words as he heard the last expiring cough of the motor. It was hopelessly short-circuited. The battery box was drenched, the spark-plugs dripping.
<br> 
<br> Kenworth turned a white face on him.
<br> 
<br> "You mean——"
<br> 
<br> "That your wicked schemes have ended in this, Kenworth—a miserable death for us all. This tinder box cannot live more than five minutes longer, if that. You had best prepare to meet your Maker."
<br> 
<br> Kenworth, moaning like the arrant coward he was, threw himself groveling on the floor of the boat.
<br> 
<br> "Oh—oh—oh! Can nothing save us?" he[Pg 159] moaned. "Listen, Strong, I have been wicked, I know. But I was poor, and gambling took away whatever money I could scrape together. I was threatened with exposure to my relatives if I did not pay my debts.
<br> 
<br> "That would have meant ruin, for, influential as they were, they had become disgusted with the poor showing I had made in the navy. It was at this crisis that I met Saki. He tempted me to betray naval secrets with promises of money. He helped me pay my debts and gave me money lavishly. In return, I furnished him with every scrap of information I could pick up. He has secret code books, fire-control plans, night signals, and details of our ammunition resources."
<br> 
<br> Ned looked at the wretch that groveled at his feet as if he could have struck him.
<br> 
<br> "How long has this been going on?" he demanded.
<br> 
<br> [Pg 160]
<br> 
<br> "For a long time. Saki had me in his power. I was helpless."
<br> 
<br> "Don't be a weakling in addition to your other faults," said Ned imperiously. "Have you that book of drawings you have been making?"
<br> 
<br> "Y-y-y-yes."
<br> 
<br> "Give it to me."
<br> 
<br> "B-b-b-but it is meant for——"
<br> 
<br> "Give it to me. If I should be saved, I will see that the proper authorities get it. If not, there will no harm come of it. Come, hand it over."
<br> 
<br> Quivering from head to foot, white-faced and limp-fingered, Kenworth fumbled in his pockets. He drew out a book and handed it over to Ned. The Dreadnought Boy took it and thrust it into his pocket.
<br> 
<br> Hardly had he done so before a giant wave swept down on the motor boat. Caught in the trough of the seas, the craft wallowed helplessly.
<br> 
<br> Then, half full of water, she sidled down the[Pg 161] other side. Ned saw that the end was at hand. With a white, set face he ripped out some life preservers from under the seats.
<br> 
<br> "Here, put these on," he commanded Kenworth and the Jap.
<br> 
<br> As he spoke, he flung one to each. They seized them, their teeth chattering and their throats uttering sounds that were hardly human. Ned took one himself and buckled it on.
<br> 
<br> "At least the stolen secrets of the United States Navy are in safe hands now," he muttered; "if I go to the bottom, there is no better keeper of confidences than old Davy Jones. If I should save my life, no power on earth will separate me from them till I have placed them in the hands of the naval authorities."
<br> 
<br> The half-filled boat kept afloat with wonderful seaworthiness, considering her narrow build. Wave after wave, that it appeared must engulf her half water-logged hull, she rode right gallantly.
<br> 
<br> [Pg 162]
<br> 
<br> Ned actually began to entertain a ray of hope that, after all, she might weather the tempest. But it was still blowing with malignant fury, and there did not appear to be any sign of abatement in the huge seas and constant display of angry lightning.
<br> 
<br> "D-d-d-do you think she can live?" stammered Kenworth.
<br> 
<br> Ned shook his head. He turned a glance of contempt upon the conscience-stricken coward.
<br> 
<br> "Do you mean to tell me that you care for life after what you have confessed to me?" he demanded. "Why, Kenworth, if I had done one half of what you admit, I should not wish ever to meet one of my fellow men again.
<br> 
<br> "Why, man, you had a glorious chance in the finest sea service in the world! What did you do with it? Chucked it away and became a pawn, a creature of your country's enemies."
<br> 
<br> Kenworth whimpered like a whipped cur.
<br> 
<br> "I—I needed the money," he stuttered; "I was[Pg 163] helpless in the hands of the Jap. I tried to do better, but somehow I couldn't break away. I—I always liked you, Strong. I did indeed. Can you save us?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, you liked me so much that on every occasion you could you took advantage of the fact that you were an officer to insult and abuse me! Kenworth, now that you are frightened at the face of death, you are willing to cringe and cow to me.
<br> 
<br> "If we were all to be saved, and our positions could ever be the same again, you would be just the same. It is the nature of such men as you. But we never shall be the same again, Kenworth. Your career is ended. Driven from the navy, branded as a traitor, you will find no peace."
<br> 
<br> "B-b-b-but life is sweet, Strong. Can't you save us? Saki will give you money. Plenty of money."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, yes, honorable sir," cried the Jap eagerly. "My emperor will reward you. I, too, am rich.[Pg 164] I will give you much money. Only save us. There is nothing——"
<br> 
<br> A scream of terror from Kenworth's white lips split the air. It sounded above the rumble of the thunder chariots.
<br> 
<br> "Look! Look!" he shrieked, high above the noises of the storm.
<br> 
<br> Towering over them, looming up through the flying wrack like the tremendous figure of fate itself, was a gigantic black form. It was right upon them.
<br> 
<br> "It's a schooner!" shouted Ned. "She's——"
<br> 
<br> There was a horrible crunching sound and the motor boat was no more. Severed clean in two, she sank, the storm-racked sea carrying with her those who a moment before had been of her company.
