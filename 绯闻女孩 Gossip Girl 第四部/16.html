It seemed like every time she looked up they were showing the same clip of Serena prancing around the runway at the Les Best show wearing her school uniform and that stupid I LOVEAARONT-shirt. Even in the bar, she could hear people murmuring, ?Who is she?? and ?Who?s Aaron?? It was enough to drive Blair right up the red velvet?covered wall. ?I wore my Yale tie this time,? Owen announced with a sly grin as he strode through the door wearing a tan Burberry trench coat and a black wool fedora hat that made him look even more manly and dashing than when she?d first met him. He slid into the red velvet?covered bench next to Blair and kissed her on the cheek. His face was damp and cold from the storm, and the feel of it against her face made her whole body tingle. ?Hello, gorgeous.? Instantly Blair forgot all about Serena. She was with a sexy older man who called her ?gorgeous.?So there. ?Hi.? She twisted her ruby ring around and around on her ring finger. ?I?m sorry I dragged you out on a night like this. I was just so . . .bored .? The cocktail waitress came over and Owen ordered a Bombay Sapphire martini straight up. He pulled a pack of Marlboro Lights from his pocket, put two cigarettes in his mouth, lit them both and passed one to Blair. His black eyebrows furrowed with brooding concern as he gazed at her with his piercingly bright blue eyes. ?You?re not in any trouble, are you?? Trouble?Blair took a drag off her cigarette and considered her answer. If you could call having a crush on your older, married Yale alum interviewer trouble, then yes, she was interrible trouble. ?Maybe,? she replied coyly. ?Are you?? The waitress brought Owen his martini. He ate the green olive floating inside it and then wiped his mouth with a cocktail napkin. A trace of dark five o?clock shadow cloaked his sharply defined chin. ?I was in a breakfast meeting this morning, eating Cheerios with five other lawyers, and I was thinking about you,? he admitted. Blair ran her fingernail over her fishnet-stockinged knee. ?Really?? she asked, immediately wishing her voice didn?t sound quite so eager and hopeful. Owen raised his glass to his lips, his blue eyes smoldering. ?Yeah. I?ve been so crazy busy this week, but I promise I?ll get that report over to the guys at Yale ASAP.? ?Oh,? Blair responded disappointedly. She twirled her little brown cocktail straw around in her drink. For once she hadn?t even been thinking about Yale. Being with Owen made her feel like she wasbeyond Yale. She was his ?gorgeous,? the star of his show. Or maybe she was only deluding herself. Glancing through the paned glass window behind them, Blair could barely see the cars parked out on the street. They were just masses of white, like big, dumb sleeping elephants. She could feel Owen watching her as she puffed on her cigarette and blew a stream of gray smoke into the air above their heads. He?d asked to see her again, hadn?t he? And he wouldn?t have done that if he wasn?t attracted to her. He was just nervous, that was all. Inside Blair?s head, the cameras were starting to roll. She was the femme fatale seducing the handsome, good, older lawyer. Yale was the last thing she wanted to talk about right now. She took one last puff on her cigarette and then stubbed it out in the chrome ashtray in the center of the table. ?I almost went to jail once,? she announced, trying to sound intriguing. This wasn?t exactly true. A few months ago she?d stolen a pair of cashmere pajamas from Barneys? men?s department to give to Nate as a surprise gift when they were having problems. But when they?d broken up for real, Serena had convinced Blair to put the pajamas back. She?d never even gotten caught. Owen chuckled and picked up his drink. He was wearing gold cuff links with a blueY stamped on them to match his blue-and-gold Yale tie. ?See, you?re just the kind of girl Yale needs,? he joked. ?And I?m a virgin,? Blair blurted out, fluttering her eyelashes at the randomness of her remark. It was strange. Even though Owen was extremely dashing and she really wanted to see what it felt like to kiss him, she was a little afraid of what she was doing. ?I?m sure Yale needs more of those, too,? Owen laughed. He crossed and then uncrossed his legs and Blair could see she was making him nervous, which wasn?t what she?d intended. She reached under the table and slipped her small, trembling fingers over his warm, tanned hand. ?I don?t mind if you kiss me,? she murmured in a low, breathy voice that sounded exactly like Marilyn Monroe inSome Like It Hot . Owen put down his drink. ?Come here,? he said gruffly, wrapping his free arm around her and pulling her toward him. His chin was rough and scratched Blair?s face as they kissed, but she?d never been kissed so expertly and powerfully in all her life. Plus he smelled faintly of Herm?s Eau d?Orange Verte, which was her all-time favorite men?s cologne. Blair had thought she?d be plagued by guilt the moment their lips met.He?s a friend of Dad?s, she reminded herself.He?s old. But Owen was such a good kisser, now that he?d started, she wasn?t about to make him stop.
