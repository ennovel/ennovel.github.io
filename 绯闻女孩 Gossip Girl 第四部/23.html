Serena cried at the top of her lungs to no one in particular. She?d been dancing with a pack of tipsy, half-naked Les Best models and her blond mane was matted to the back of her neck, creating a sort of unidreadlock, beach hair effect. She?d been relieved of her I LOVEAARONT-shirt for a cool four thousand bucks by her old friend Guy Reed from the Les Best boutique and was now wearing only a hot pink La Perla demibra that looked like a bikini top. ?Snow volleyball!? a guy shouted back even louder. He was dressed in a black ski suit from the Les Best ski line, black fur boots, and a pair of black fur earmuffs clung to his ears. He pointed out the huge bar windows to where a volleyball net had been set up outside on the snowy sidewalk. In a matter of seconds the entire roomful of writhing, sweaty bodies attacked the coat closet, pulling on the nearest Fendi sheepskin or goose-down Gucci parka to protect their skinny bodies from the cold before they dashed outside to frolic in the snow. Serena giggled as she slipped into a beige fleece-lined down parka with a beaver fur?trimmed hood that would have fit a giant Eskimo. In the last two hours she?d drunk more champagne than she had on New Year?s Eve and she felt giddy and warm all over. Before she could even zip up her coat, someone grabbed her hand and pulled her out the door with him. Outside the snow had enveloped everything and the streetlights glowed gold on the downy white blanket. Without the constant honk and roar of traffic, there was a pleasant calm about the city, as if it had finally gone to sleep. Shrieking in merriment, the gang of models, stylists, and photographers plowed through the thigh-deep drifts and began spiking balls over the volleyball net with total disregard for the peaceful scene. ?Isn?t it beautiful?? Serena breathed. She wished Aaron were there so she could kiss him and tell him how much she loved him while stuffing a great big snowball down the back of his shirt. But he wasn?t?the party pooper?so she would just have to make do. She turned to the guy holding her hand. It was the guy in the black ski suit, and he was tall, blond, and gorgeous. Everyone there was. She let go of his hand and scooped up a handful of snow. ?Come here,? she beckoned him. ?I want to tell you a secret.? He took a step toward her, his breath filling the air with steamy clouds. ?What?? Serena stood on tiptoe and wrapped her arms around his neck. Then she kissed his cold, smooth cheek. ?I love Aaron!? she squealed, stuffing the snowball down the back of his black ski suit and tearing off through the snow to join the others. The guy chased after her, grabbing her legs and knocking her down just as they reached the volleyball net. The game was halted as the crowd of gorgeous revelers began to hurl snowballs at the frolicking pair, stopping now and then to light cigarettes or reapply their lip gloss before joining in again. Serena howled with laughter as snow went down the back of her jeans. That was the great thing about being so beautiful and so carefree. It didn?t matter who you were with or what silly thing you were doing?you always had a fabulous time. In fact, you didn?t even have to be in love with just one person when the world was already so in love with you.
