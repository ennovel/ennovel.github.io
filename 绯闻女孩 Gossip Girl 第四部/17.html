Like she could just slip on her boyfriend?s dirty old jeans and make them look fresh and sexy.? Serena shook her lovely blond head in good-natured protest and puffed on an American Spirit. ?My boyfriend never wears jeans. He thinks they?re overrated. He wears those green canvas army pants. You know, the real ones from the army surplus store?? She glanced around the crowded, smoky after-party which was in full force at Cr?me, a new go-go club on Forty-third Street, but she didn?t see Aaron anywhere. He?d never come backstage at the show, so she?d figured she?d just meet him here. ?And is your boyfriend named Aaron, by any chance?? the stylist asked. He giggled and pointed at her T-shirt. ?You should get Les to make a whole line of those. Everyone would totally go for it?it would be so wild!? ?Would you mind stepping back for a moment so I could get her picture?? the photographer asked the stylist. ?And could you autograph this Polaroid for my collection, Serena?? a tiny leather-pants-wearing older man with a white buzz cut asked. ?Me too!? another voice chimed in. Serena hitched up the baby blue hip-hugging Les Best jeans she?d acquired compliments of the house and pointed to the I LOVEAARONlogo emblazoned on the front of her shirt as she grinned cheesily for the camera. ?I bet if you held an auction for that shirt right now, you could sell it for a thousand dollars,? the photographer quipped as he snapped away. ?But of course you?d never part with it.? Serena took another puff on her cigarette as the group around her waited for her to respond. The T-shirt was cute, but it was really just a spur of the moment thing she?d done because she?d thought Aaron would think it was funny and to make it up to him for appearing in a fashion show on a Friday night,their night. She was a spur-of-the-moment kind of gal, which was exactly why this auction idea sounded so appealing. She could give the money to a good cause like Little Hearts, that children?s charity the Valentine?s Day ball money was supposed to go to. ?Let?s do it,? she giggled giddily. The group of admirers whooped with delight and followed her over to the bar like adoring little mice following the Pied Piper. ?Who wants to buy a T-shirt?? Serena crowed, jumping up on top of the bar, and parading up and down like she was on the runway again. Of course only someone as gorgeous as she was could actually get away with this. The DJ joined in the fun, putting on Madonna?s old classic, ?Vogue,? and turning the volume all the way up. Serena shook her booty and stuck out her chest?it was all in good fun?as every pair of eyes in the club tuned in to watch. ?Five hundred dollars!? someone shouted. ?Anyone else?? Serena taunted the dazzled crowd. ?It?s for a good cause.?
<br> &nbsp;?Seven hundred!?&nbsp; ?Eight!? Serena stopped dancing, rolled her eyes and whipped her cigarettes out of her pocket, as if to say, ?Your stinginess bores me.? The crowd laughed and fifteen or so lighters were offered her way. She bent down to grab a light from a lucky dude wearing a fur vest, and then pranced away again, shaking her hips to the music and puffing away as she waited for the bidding to go up. ?A thousand dollars!? the dude wearing the fur vest shouted. He?d gotten close enough to Serena to know that it was worth it. Serena threw her arms in the air and whooped loudly, daring someone to take the bidding to new heights. As much as she hated to admit it, she didn?t even mind that Aaron hadn?t turned up. She might have loved him, but she was having a kick-ass time without him. ================================== ABC Amber LIT Converter v2.02 ================================== Disclaimer: All the real names of places, people, and events have been altered or abbreviated to protect the innocent. Namely, me.&nbsp; hey people!&nbsp; Early rejection So I heard the Ivies have come up with a conspiracy to maintain their intrigue and exclusivity: This year they?re not acceptinganyone early. Maybe it?s only a false rumor. But if you don?t get in early, try to think of it this way: Maybe you weretoo perfect. They just couldn?t handle it. And just think how much fun we?ll have if we all wind up at the same community college! To surgically enhance or not, that is the question The idea of surgically altering one?s body in any way has always freaked me out, not because I don?t think Dolly Parton looks great. She doesn?t look a day over forty and she must be two hundred by now. But I?d be worried the doctors would make a mistake and deflate one breast entirely or leave out a nostril or something. Of course I?m as girly a girl as girls come, and I know how important it is to feel good about my appearance. I try to think of it this way though: You know when you see a gorgeous boy on the street and you say to your friend, ?Look athim !? and then your friend makes a face like,ugly ? We all have suchtotally varied tastes that someone is going to look at you and think,yum-yum dee-lish, no matter whatyou think you look like. You just have to learn to see what they see.&nbsp; Your e-mail Q:? ? Dear G-Girl, I heard you got in early to Bryn Mawr and you?re psyched because you like going to school with girls and you?re this huge volleyball-playing lesbo. Tee hee.&nbsp; ?dorf A:? ? Hello dorf, What kind of a name is dorf, anyway? I refuse to stoop to your level of humor or tell you where I applied to college, but my mother and sister both happened to go to Bryn Mawr, and guess what? They?re bothhot .&nbsp; ?GG Gotta dash home and check the mail for an important-looking business-sized envelope that may or may not determine my entire near future. Wish me luck! You know you love me.&nbsp; gossip girl
