Not that she minded talking about hooking up with boys, or peer pressure, or whatever else the freshmen wanted to talk about. After all, today was Valentine?s Day, soeveryone at Constance was talking about hooking up with boys. What she dreaded were all the questions the ninth graders in the group were going to ask Serena about walking the runway in the Les Best show, what it had been like to hang out with all those famous models, and blah, blah, blah. They?d probably ask about her stupid I LOVEAARONT-shirt and what was going on with her and Aaron, becausethey?d heard blah, blah, blah. As if it was all so very interesting.
<br> &nbsp;Not. Why was it that the world was so full of followers when there were so many choices in life? Blair slipped an extra slice of chocolate cake onto her tray just to make sure she?d have something to do while the girls in peer group were boring her to death. ?Hello,? she practically yawned when she sat down at the crowded table a few minutes after the group had begun. ?Sorry I?m late.? ?That?s okay,? Serena replied gaily. She?d gotten a complimentary trim and highlight job before the fashion show, and her long blond hair was even shinier and more perfect than it had been before. ?We were just talking about Elise?s parental problems. She thinks her dad might be having an affair.? Elise?s thick, straw-colored bangs were pulled back and clipped to the sides of her head with tiny pink heart barrettes. There were dark circles under her bright blue eyes, like she?d been up all night worrying. ?That sucks,? Blair said sympathetically. ?Believe me, Iknow .? She decided to leave it at that. Peer group might have been a place for sharing, but she wasn?t about to go into the details of her father?s affairs with other men while he was still married to her mother. Serena nodded vigorously. ?I was just telling them how all families are totally fucked up. Actually, Blair, your family is a perfect example,? she added cheerfully. Blair bristled. ?Thanks a lot,? she shot back. ?But I don?t think everyone needs to hear about my problems right now.? Jenny bit a cuticle and banged her foot nervously against the leg of her chair. She?d been fretting all morning that as soon as peer group started, Elise was going to dive right in and start talking about same-sex kissing. Thank God Elise had other things on her mind. ?Anyway, we don?t have to talk about our messed-up families if it?s going bother you,? Blair told Elise, trying to be supportive. Elise nodded unhappily. ?Actually therewas something else I wanted to talk about.?
<br> &nbsp;Jenny winced.&nbsp; Oops. Blair nodded encouragingly, ?Yes? What is it?? Vicky Reinerson waved her hand in the air. She was wearing a red wool cape similar to the one Serena had modeled in the Les Best show, except hers was a little used looking, like she?d borrowed it from her grandmother or something. Guess she didn?t get the message that capes are back in style thisfall , not this spring. ?Oh, but after she?s done will youplease tell us all about the Les Best show, Serena?? Vicky pleaded. ?Youpromised .? Serena giggled as if she hadtons of crazy stories to tell. Blair wanted to smack her. ?The craziest thing was that I had a snowball fight with Les Best himself and I didn?t even know it was him!? Serena glanced at Blair, who was glaring at her. ?Anyway, I?ll save it for the end, if there?s time.? She turned back to Elise. ?What was it you were saying?? Elise?s face turned purple as a plum. ?I-I wanted to talk about kissing,? she stammered. ?About kissinggirls .? Jenny kicked the legs of Elise?s chair. Mary, Cassie, and Vicky snickered and nudged each other?s elbows. This was going to be good. A rumor had gone around awhile back that Blair and Serena had kissed each other in the hot tub in the hotel suite Chuck Bass?s family kept downtown in the Tribeca Star. ?I think anyone should be able to kiss anyone,? Serena replied. ?Kissing is fun!? Blair forked a giant piece of chocolate cake into her mouth, trying to come up with something to top what Serena had just said. ?Guys like to watch girls kiss,? she declared with her mouth full. ?They do it all the time in the movies, just to turn guys on.? This was true. They?d even talked about it in Mr. Beckham?s film class. ?So Serena, whatwas it like to wear all those cool Les Best clothes?? Jenny asked, desperate to change the subject. Serena stretched her long, lithe arms over her gorgeous blond head and sighed happily. ?You really want to know?? Everyone in the group except Blair and Elise nodded eagerly. ?Okay, I?ll tell you.? Blair rolled her eyes, daring herself to shut Serena up by announcing the news of her torrid affair with a married thirty-eight-year-old man, which was a hell of a lot more interesting than prancing around on a runway in dumb clothes no one wanted to wear anyway. She glanced down at the table where Elise was furiously scribbling her name over and over on a sheet of notebook paper.Elise Wells. Miss Elise Wells. Miss Elise Patricia Wells. E.P. Wells. Suddenly Blair felt the entire contents of her stomach do a back walkover into her throat.Wells? That wasOwen ?s last name. And Elise had just said she thought herfather was having anaffair . Owen hadn?t said anything to her about a daughter, but now that she thought about it, Elise had his same eyes, and on the stoop Elise had lit two cigarettes exactly the same way Owen had Friday night in the bar.Christ . For all Blair knew, Owen hadten children that he?d just happened to forget to mention.Fuck! Blair scraped her chair back and bolted for the nurse?s office behind the cafeteria, getting there just in time to spew chocolate cake all over Nurse O?Donnell?s hand-hooked farmhouse rug. It wasn?t pretty, but it was the quickest way to get sent home sick from school. As soon as she left, the cafeteria began to hum with the sound of girls trading versions of what was wrong with Blair Waldorf. ?I heard she has some rare disease. She lost all her hair. That?s really a wig,? announced Laura Salmon. ?I heard she?s pregnant with some old guy?s kid. He?s married to a member of the royal family and he wants to marry her, but his wife won?t give him a divorce,? Rain Hoffstetter explained. ?Oh my God. So she and her mom could like, have babies at the same time!? Kati Farkas shrieked. ?She?s not pregnant, stupid. It?s her eating disorder,? Isabel Coates told the girls at the same table in a confidential whisper. ?She?s been struggling with it for years.? At the peer group table, Serena unwittingly set the record straight. ?She?ll befine just as soon as she finds out she?s into Yale.?
