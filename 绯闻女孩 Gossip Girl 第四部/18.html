Georgie told Nate. ?He does whatever I tell him to.? When group therapy had been over and it was time for the outpatients to go home, the storm had already been so bad, Nate couldn?t get a car to take him to the station, so Georgie had offered to give him a ride. Then when they?d gotten to the station the trains had stopped running, so the ever-accommodating Georgie had taken Nate home to her house in her bodyguard-driven black Range Rover. Now they were sitting on the floor of her enormous, luxurious bedroom, getting stoned as they watched the snow pile up on the skylight overhead. The Upper East Side town house Nate had grown up in was four stories high and had its own elevator and a twenty-four-hour cook. But Georgie?s Greenwich, Connecticut, mansion had something his family?s town house didn?t?vast amounts of space inside, and acres of land around the house. It was like a city unto itself, and Georgie had her own private borough where she could do absolutely whatever she pleased while her ancient English nanny was in bed watching BBC America and the other servants were doing their jobs in the other boroughs. Georgie?s bathroom even had a Roman daybed in it for lounging on while she waited for her twelve-foot-wide marble Jacuzzi to fill up. ?Or we could have crazy loud sex on the stairs,? Georgie added. ?That would really drive the staff nuts.? Nate leaned his head back against the footboard of Georgie?s four-poster king-sized bed and put the joint they were sharing to his lips. ?Let?s just watch the snow fall for a while.? Georgie rolled over on her back, resting her head on the leg of Nate?s navy blue Culture of Humanity ripstop trousers. ?God, you?re mellow. I?m not used to hanging out with someone so mellow.? ?What are your friends like?? Nate asked, sucking hard on the joint. Pot seemed to taste and feel better now that he?d gone without it for a while. ?I don?t have any friends anymore,? Georgie answered. ?They all kind of gave up on me because I?m so nuts.? Nate put his hand on her head and began stroking her hair. She had incredibly soft, luxurious hair. ?I hang out a lot with these three guys in my class at school,? he said, referring to Jeremy, Anthony, and Charlie. ?But I went for a few days without getting high and I didn?t really want to hang out with them, you know?? ?That?s what Jackie calls a ?negative friendship.? A ?positive friendship? is when you do fun, constructive things with your friends like baking cookies, making collages, and climbing mountains.? ?I?m your friend,? Nate offered quietly. Georgie rubbed the back of her head against his leg. ?I know.? She laughed, her not-too-small chest jiggling up and down inside her tight white T-shirt. ?Want to bake some cookies?? Nate combed a lock of her hair up into the air with his fingers and then let it fall, strand by strand, back into his lap. Blair had long hair, too, but it wasn?t as straight or as silky as Georgie?s. It was funny how girls could all be so different. ?Can I kiss you?? he asked, not really having intended to sound so formal. ?Okay,? Georgie whispered. Nate bent over and brushed his lips against the bridge of her nose, her chin, and finally her lips. She kissed him back hungrily and then pulled away and sat up on her elbows. ?This is what Jackie calls ?feeding your craving.? You?re doing something that feels good temporarily instead of ?healing the wounds.? Nate shrugged. ?Why is it temporary?? He pointed up at the skylight, which was completely smothered in snow. ?I?m not going anywhere.? Georgie scooched her feet up under her and stood up. She disappeared into the bathroom and Nate could hear a cabinet door open and the sounds of pill bottles rattling and water running. Then she came out, brushing her teeth, her light brown eyes all lit up like she?d just had an epiphany, or at the very least a good idea. ?There?s an old carriage up in the attic. We can go up and sit in it,? she announced with her mouth full of toothpaste. She went back into the bathroom to spit and then came out again, holding a pale hand out to Nate. ?Are you coming?? Nate stood up and took her hand. His body was humming from the pot and the intense smoothness of Georgie?s skin. All he really wanted to do was to kiss her some more. ?Can I ?feed my craving? when we get up there?? he asked, feeling very stoned indeed. Georgie cocked a thin dark eyebrow at him and licked her dark red lips. ?I might even let you ?heal my wounds.?? Nate grinned his lopsided stoner grin. Who?d known rehab psychobabble could be such a turn-on!&nbsp;
