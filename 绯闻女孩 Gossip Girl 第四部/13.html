Their skirts were so short he could even see the frilly white panties they were wearing underneath, which happened to be little girls? vintage underwear from the nineteen-fifties and fit so snugly on the models that their butt cheeks were busting out of them. Instead of sitting down in the front row, where Rusty Klein had managed to snag him a seat between Stevie Nicks and superhip performance artist Vanessa Beecroft, Dan stood at the back of the Harrison Street Club, clutching his black leather-bound notebook and trying to look writerly in case Rusty Klein was somewhere nearby and was secretly studying him. The show was set to strange German folk music and there was straw scattered on the runway. Little boys with blond pageboy haircuts wearing lederhosen led bleating white goats around by leather leashes as impossibly tall models stomped by them, their bare breasts bobbing. Bestiality, Dan scribbled furtively in his notebook. The goats were crapping all over the place and he noticed that the hems of the models? skirts had been shredded on purpose. Tears were drawn on their cheeks in iridescent blue eye pencil.Ruined milkmaids , Dan wrote, trying not to feel completely out of place. What the hell was he doing at a fashion show anyway? The twenty-something-year-old brunette next to him leaned over and tried to read what he was writing. ?Who are you with?? she demanded. ?Nylon?Time Out ?? She was wearing pointy rhinestone-studded glasses fastened old-lady style to a gold chain around her neck and had the thickest bangs Dan had ever seen. ?Why aren?t you seated with press?? Dan closed his black notebook before she could read any more. ?I?m a poet,? he said importantly. ?Rusty Klein invited me.? The woman didn?t seem that impressed. ?What have you published lately?? she asked suspiciously. Dan tucked his notebook under his arm and smoothed down his new set of sideburns. One of the goats had gotten loose and jumped off the runway. Four security guards ran after it. ?Actually, one of my more recent poems is in this week?s issue ofThe New Yorker . It?s called ?Sluts.?? ?No way!? the woman gushed in a loud whisper. She pulled her lavender leather Better Than Naked tote bag into her lap and retrieved her copy ofThe New Yorker . Flipping through it, she turned to page forty-two. ?You don?t understand. I read this poem over the phone toall my girlfriends. I can?t believe you wrote it.? Dan didn?t know what to say. This was his first encounter with an actual fan and he felt simultaneously embarrassed and thrilled. ?I?m glad you liked it,? he replied modestly. ?Liked it?? the woman repeated. ?It changed my life! Would you mind signing this for me?? she asked, thrusting the magazine into his lap. Dan shrugged and retrieved his pen.Daniel Humphrey , he scribbled just beside his poem, but his signature looked a little plain and impersonal so he added a squiggly little flourish underneath it. He?d scribbled over a few lines of the Gabriel Garcia Rhodes story, which seemed kind of like sacrilege, but who really cared, when he?d just signed his first autograph. He was famous?a real, genuine writer! ?Thank youso, so much,? the woman said, taking the magazine back. She pointed to his notebook. ?Now you go ahead and keep writing,? she whispered reverently. ?Forget I bothered you.? German folk music morphed into opera and the little boys left the runway leading their goats. Models floated in wearing long black wool capes, peacock blue suede thigh-high boots, and ostrich feather headdresses. They looked like characters out of aLord of the Rings sequel. Dan flipped open his notebook and began to write.Good and bad witches, he scribbled.Hunting hungry wolves . He bit the end of his pen and then added,Wish I could smoke a fucking cigarette .
