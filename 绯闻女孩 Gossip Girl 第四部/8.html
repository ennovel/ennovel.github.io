She pulled her curly black hair out of the way and prodded the wax in her right ear with the eraser of a yellow number two pencil. ?Remember, it?s notwhat you?re writing about buthow you describe it.? None of the girls looked up. They were too busy writing, and besides, they really didn?t want to see what Ms. Crumb was doing when she thought they weren?t looking. They?d already been grossed out enough times. According to the girls,all the female teachers at Constance Billard were lesbians, but Ms. Crumb was the only teacher at Constance who was officially out. She wore a rainbow pin to school every day, shared a country house in New Paltz with five other women, and often referred to her ?partner??as in, ?The other night my partner was drinking Amstel Lite and watching Barbara Walters, who she has a total crush on,while I sat in the kitchen and graded your papers.? Every year the ninth graders looked forward to having Ms. Crumb?s creative writing class, assuming she?d be cool and down-to-earth since she was so forthright about her sexuality. But after a day in her classroom her students realized they weren?t just going to sit around for forty-five minutes talking about girl stuff with a woman who liked girls?they were going to have to write things every day in class, read them out loud,and then listen to Ms. Crumb and their classmates criticize what they had written in a sometimes not very nice way. Ms. Crumb was a major hardass, but as far as subjects went, creative writing was still a hell of a lot better than geometry. Today Ms. Crumb had asked the girls to pick a partner? in the platonic sense?and write a paragraph describing a part of their partner?s body. Of course Elise and Jenny had picked each other. They were beginning to do almost everything together. It?s odd that we decorate our ears with earrings and don?t try to cover them,Jenny wrote.They?re just as indecent as the parts we do cover, like bare holes that go straight into our heads. My friend Elise?s ears are small, with a little blond fuzz on them. She has good hearing, too, because she never says, ?What?? and asks me to repeat myself. I guess she keeps them pretty clean. Jenny looked up and decided to erase the last line and replace it with something else. Ms. Crumb might get offended, since she obviously had some kind of ear-cleaning fetish. But instead of writing something else to replace the ear-cleaning line, Jenny?s mind wandered back to her e-mail. She?d been checking it regularly, just like Blair had told her to; however, the only messages she?d gotten had been jokey ones from Elise and her brother, telling her to stop checking her e-mail and get back to her homework. She glanced at Elise, who was scribbling away, already on her second page. Jenny wished she had Dan?s knack for the written word. She was better at detailed drawings and painting and calligraphy. At the top of the page she drew an elaborate drawing of Elise?s ear and the side of her face, hoping she?d score points for being artistic, even if her essay sucked. Her mind wandered again, to the blond boy she?d spotted in Bendel?s. Was he artistic, too? The bell rang to mark the end of last period and Ms. Crumb stood up and brushed chalk dust from her dark gray wool pinafore dress that looked like it had been made by nuns somewhere cold and fashionless, like Greenland. ?Time?s up, ladies. Pencils down. You can hand in your papers as you leave.? She tucked her maroon-stockinged feet into a pair of black felt L.L. Bean clogs. ?Happy Thursday afternoon!? ?So what?d you write about?? Jenny asked Elise after they had packed up their book bags and were on their way out the school doors. ?None of your business,? Elise answered, blushing. ?Don?t think I?m never going to find out. You?ll probably have to read it out loud on Monday,? Jenny reminded her. ?I wrote about your ears, but it kind of sucked.? The two girls bowed their heads against the fierce February wind and headed over to Lexington to take the bus down to Bloomingdale?s on East Fifty-ninth Street. Elise had enlisted Jenny to help her to find the perfect pair of jeans for less than eighty dollars, and, as usual, Jenny needed some new bras, since she was always wearing out the elastic or breaking the underwires in the ones she had. Bloomingdale?s was a tacky war zone of tourists sporting the new tracksuits and sneakers they?d just bought at Nike Town, along with gaggles of blue-haired bargain hunters, but it was the only place to go for oversized bras and moderately priced jeans other than Macy?s, which was simply gross. Those with better taste and bigger credit limits went to Bergdorf?s, Bendel?s, or Barneys, but for people like Jenny and Elise, Bloomingdale?s would just have to do. ?I can?t believe you can just put those on and they?re the perfect length,? Jenny said enviously as she watched Elise try on her first pair of Paris Blues jeans in the dressing room. Jenny was barely five feet tall and had to shorten everything. Elise was five foot seven, but she had other problems, like her completely flat chest and the podge that padded her hip bones and lower back like a second butt. Elise scrunched up her freckled face and stared down at the bulges riding above the waistband of the low-rise jeans. ?See why I can?t eat in public?? she grunted, sucking in her stomach and tugging on the waistband. The jeans were 9 percent Lycra, but that didn?t seem to make much difference. She exhaled and let her stomach out, giving up. ?Okay, forget it. Next pair.? As Elise inched herself out of the reject ones, Jenny held up a beautiful pair of dark rinse flared Seven jeans that were on sale and would be a major score if they fit. She noticed Elise was wearing light blue lacy underwear and quickly averted her eyes so Elise wouldn?t accuse her of staring. Elise took the jeans, slipped her feet into them and slid them up around her hips. ?Oh my God. I can?t believe I forgot to tell you this,? she said, tugging on the button-fly waist. ?Before creative writing I heard Kati Farkas and Isabel Coates talking about Nate Archibald in the bathroom at school. They said he almost had to go tojail because he was caught dealing to some twelve-year-olds in the park. His dad had to go down to the police station and bail him out, but he still has to go torehab . Weren?t you guys kind oftogether for a little while? Did you hear about this? Isn?t it crazy?? Jenny hadn?t heard, and she wasn?t quite sure how she felt about it. Nate had pretty much blown her off completely in the end, brushing her away like a pesky fly, so she guessed he?d gotten what he deserved. Besides, Nate seemed like the type of guy who would always rise to the top again, unscathed. Why should she waste any more time worrying or eventhinking about him? She watched Elise struggle with the copper buttons on her jeans. They were perfect everywhere else, but the waist was so tight there was no way she?d ever be able to sit down in them. ?Why don?t you just try the next size up?? Elise squinted her hard blue eyes stubbornly. She did that kind of a lot, causing Jenny to wonder if she needed glasses. ?Because, Miss Size Zero, I?m a size seven, not a size nine. Pass me another pair, and stop staring at my fat.? ?I?m not,? Jenny insisted, handing her a stretchy pair of Lei jeans that were a little too distressed, with frayed cuffs and holes in the pockets, but with a wide, low waist that looked like it might actually sit nicely on Elise?s hips. ?And it?s not like anyone has to know what size you are. I won?t tell.? Jenny immediately thought of her own size issue. She hadn?t planned on inviting Elise into the dressing room with her when she tried on bras. Sure, they were becoming close friends, but was it really necessary for Elise to know that she wasn?t just a D cup, but adouble D? Still, it seemed mean not to reciprocate when Elise had invited her to help try on jeans. Elise wrinkled up her nose at the Leis. ?Those are way too fake looking.? ?So what do you want to do?? Jenny asked, tossing the jeans on the bench in the back of the narrow dressing room. Elise buttoned up her uniform and slid her feet into her prissy black flats. It amazed Jenny how neat-and-sweet-little-school-girl Elise appeared until you got to know her. ?I?m keeping the Sevens. I know they don?t fit now, but I?m planning to lose ten pounds before the end of the year. Andyou?re going to help me.? Jenny nodded. It wasn?t like she didn?t ever buy stuff that was too small. Yes, it?s calledaspirational shopping. Every girl with ambition does it. The dressing rooms in the lingerie department were dirty, cramped, and badly lit. With her back to Elise, Jenny pulled her cornflower blue V-neck J. Crew sweater over her head and threw it on the stool in the corner. Then she pulled her white Gap T-shirt off and dropped it on the floor, crossing her arms over her breasts self-consciously. ?Which one do you want to try on first?? Elise asked, sorting through the plastic hangers that Jenny had hastily snatched up with businesslike efficiency. ?The lacy black one with the funky clasp or the comfy white cotton one with the extrawide straps?? ?Just hand me the black one,? Jenny mumbled, reaching behind her to retrieve the bra. She unhooked the ugly beige supersupportive Bali bra she was wearing and let it fall to the floor, fumbling with the black bra while trying to keep the insides of her elbows pressed against her ribcage to cover herself. The straps on the black bra were shortened all the way, and the clasp was a strange gold metal contraption instead of the normal hook and eye. Jenny glanced up to find Elise watching her in the mirror. The dressing room had mirrors on three sides, so it wasn?t like Jenny was really achieving anything by turning her back. ?Want some help?? Elise took a step forward. Jenny?s back was rigid. She could pretty much forget about being modest. Elise was going to see her boobs no matter what. She let her arms drop and turned around, full frontal. ?Help me loosen the straps?? she asked, trying to sound nonchalant. She handed Elise the bra, her breasts hanging in front of her like fully risen loaves of sourdough bread. She had to admit it felt slightly liberating. Slightly liberating and totally embarrassing. Elise set to work adjusting the bra, not even trying to hide the fact that she was staring at Jenny?s boobs at the same time. ?Wow. They reallyare big,? she observed. ?How can you be so tiny and have such big bobos?? Jenny put her hands on her hips and stared back at Elise, trying to come up with a smart retort, but instead she burst out laughing. ?Bobos?? she giggled. Elise blushed and handed Jenny back the bra. ?I?ve always called them that. Ever since I was little.? Jenny slid the straps over her arms and then turned around. ?Can you figure out the clasp?? Elise hooked it closed and Jenny turned around again. The bra had great support, but her boobs were pressed so close together, her cleavage was a mile deep. Elise was still staring. ?Do you think it?s too slutty?? Jenny asked. She giggled. ?I mean, this kind of makes my bobos look even bigger.? Elise had stopped blinking, which was what she always did when she was distracted. ?You know when you asked me what I wrote about today in creative writing?? she asked. Jenny nodded and turned around so Elise could unhook the bra. ?Well, that?s what I wrote about. Your bobos.? Jenny?s back went rigid again. If a guy told you he?d written about your breasts, you pretty much knew he was either hitting on you or he was a pervert. But since Elise was a girl and her friend, Jenny wasn?t sure how to feel about it. ?I think I?m done,? she said quickly. She picked her old bra up off the floor and slipped it on. ?I?m going to buy the black one.? They?d brought eight bras into the dressing room but Jenny had only tried on one. ?Are you sure you don?t want to try some of the others?? Elise asked. Jenny pulled on her T-shirt and tucked her sweater under her arm. The tiny dressing room suddenly felt extremely claustrophobic. ?Nah,? she answered, yanking aside the black curtain and stepping back into the main room of the lingerie department, which of course was wall-to-wall bras. It would be nice to go someplace where breasts weren?t the main focus of everyone?s attention.&nbsp; Like another planet?
