Jenny complained to Elise after she?d painted Elise?s head and neck. ?I?ll do the rest tomorrow.? ?Let?s see,? Elise said, sitting up. Her chest was so small Jenny couldn?t help but stare at it. Her breasts were like the little new potatoes her dad had grown when they?d rented a house in Pennsylvania one summer. Small, hard, and beigey pink. ?It looks good,? Elise said, squinting at the canvas. ?But how come you made my face green?? Jenny hated when people asked her questions about her art. She didn?t know why she did what she did, she just did it. And her dad always said, ?The artist doesn?t have to answer to anyone but himself.? Orher self, in her case. ?Because I was in a green mood,? she answered, annoyed. ?Well, green is my favorite color,? Elise responded happily. She pulled on her turtleneck and underwear but left her jeans and bra on the floor. ?Oh my God. I have that book, too!? she squealed, pointing at a thick, heavy paperback on the bookshelf behind the TV. She walked over to the shelf and pulled the book out. ?But yours is so new. Don?t you ever read it?? Jenny bit off the top of an Oreo and read the title on the spine of book.The New This Is My Body for Women. ?My dad bought me that last year. I think he probably thought that if I read it, he wouldn?t have to explain anything to me about sex?I could just look up the embarrassing stuff.? ?But have you ever actually looked at it? Some of it is reallygraphic .? Jenny had no idea. She?d immediately shelved the book behind the TV along with the other random books her father had given her that she never intended to read, likeBreathing Room: A Buddhist?s Guide to Living Creatively, Mao?s Secret Seven: The Women Behind Chairman Mao, andFinding the Dragon Within:What Is Your Art? ?Like, graphic in what way?? Jenny asked, intrigued. Elise carried the book over to the worn leather sofa and sat down, crossing her long bare legs dramatically. ?I?ll show you.? She opened the book and Jenny sat down next to her and leaned in close to see. The first thing Elise turned to was a detailed diagram of a woman on her hands and knees bent over a man lying on his back. The book had been written in the nineteen-seventies and the text had since been updated, but the diagrams hadn?t. The man had hair down to his shoulders, a full beard, and was wearing beads. His penis was sticking straight up and it appeared to be in the woman?s mouth. The two girls erupted into giggles.
<br> &nbsp;Ew! ?I told you,? said Elise, pleased with herself for opening right up to such a gem. ?I can?t believe I never saw any of this,? Jenny exclaimed. She grabbed the book away from Elise and rifled through the pages. ?Oh my God!? she gasped when she saw a diagram of the same couple in another position. The woman still had the long-haired guy?s penis in her mouth, except this time she was lying alongside him with her feet up around his head and her legs splayed so that he could do the same thing toher . Jenny didn?t even know the name forthat . ?I thought this was just a boring book about getting your period and all that stuff. But this is, like, a realsex book forwomen .? ?I think there?s a teen one, too, that?s totally boring, but my mom got me this one by mistake. I couldn?t believe it when I started reading it!? The two girls pored over the pages until they stumbled upon a section called Same-Sex Relationships. ?Like Ms. Crumb,? Jenny observed, reading. The introduction was long and started with the line, ?Your feelings are genuine and not to be ignored. . . .? Outside she could hear the grating sound of a snowplow driving by. She looked up to watch the snow falling steadily through the grimy living room window. ?Hey. You want to try it?? Elise asked. Jenny turned back to the book. ?What?? ?Kissing,? Elise answered in barely a whisper. Your feelings are genuine and not to be ignored. Yes, but Jenny didn?t really have any feelings for Elise. She liked her and everything but she wasn?tattracted to her. Still, kissing a girl sounded exciting. It was something she?d never done before, and if it felt uncomfortable, she could always pretend to be kissing that tall blond boy she?d spotted in Bendel?s. She closed the book and folded her hands in her lap. Her face was only inches away from Elise?s. ?Okay, let?s do it.? It was just an experiment, something new to try on a boring, snowy night. Elise leaned forward and put her hand on Jenny?s arm. Then she closed her eyes and Jenny closed hers, too. Elise pressed her lips against Jenny?s tightly clenched mouth. It wasn?t a kiss exactly?it was toodry . It felt more like a nudge or something. Elise pulled her head back and both girls opened their eyes. ?It says in the book to relax and enjoy yourself, especially when it?s your first time.? What, had she, like, memorized the book? Jenny pulled her curly brown hair up on top of her head and blew a big breath out through her nose. She didn?t know what she was so nervous about, but she would have preferred it if Elise had still been wearing her pants. ?Do you mind putting your jeans back on?? she asked. ?I think I could, you know, relax more if you were like, dressed.? Elise hopped up and scooted into her jeans. ?There, is that better?? she asked, leaving them unbuttoned as she sat down on the sofa again. ?Okay. Let?s try it again,? Jenny replied, revving herself up. She closed her eyes and slid her hands under Elise?s hair and around her neck, trying to be less of a prude about the whole thing. After all, she was an artist, and artists did all sorts of crazy things.
