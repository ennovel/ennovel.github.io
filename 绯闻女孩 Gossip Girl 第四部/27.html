Lucky for Nate, St. Jude?s was the oldest boys? school in Manhattan and had kept its tradition of ending the school day at 2P.M. for both lower- and upper-school boys, even though most of the other city schools let out at 4P.M. The school?s reasoning was that it gave the boys extra time to play sports and do the copious amounts of homework they were sent home with every afternoon. It also gave them plenty of time to kick back and get high before, during, andafter they played sports and did their homework. The last time Nate had seen Mitchell, the wisecracking Kangol hat?wearing dealer had said he?d be moving back home to Amsterdam very soon. Today was Nate?s last chance to score the biggest bag of sweet, Peruvian-grown weed Mitchell could provide. Blair had always complained about Nate?s pot-smoking when they were together, whining about how boring it was to watch him staring at the Persian rug on her bedroom floor for ten minutes when they could have been fooling around or at a party somewhere. Nate had always maintained that his pot-smoking was a mere indulgence, like eating chocolate?something he could give up any time. And just to prove it?not that heneeded to prove anything to Blair anymore?he was going to go cold turkey after he?d smoked every last leaf of pot from the giant bag he was going to buy today. If he were careful, he could make the bag last a good eight weeks. Until then he preferred not to eventhink about quitting. ?Two plain slices,? Nate told the gangly, balding pizza chef wearing a bright purple WELCOME TOLOSERVILLET-shirt. He rested his elbows on the pizza joint?s red linoleum counter-top, nudging aside plastic containers filled with garlic salt, red pepper flakes, and oregano. ?Where?s Mitchell?? Mitchell?s little side business was no secret in the pizza parlor. The pizza chef raised his bushy black eyebrows. His name might actually have been Ray, but even after years of buying pizza and pot there Nate still wasn?t sure. ?Mitchell?s gone already. You missed him.? Nate patted the back pocket of his khakis, where he?d shoved his bulging Coach wallet, a sour lump of panic rising in his throat. Of course he wasn?taddicted , but he didn?t like being stuck without any weed at all when he?d been planning to roll a nice big fatty to while away the afternoon. And tomorrow afternoon, and the day after that . . . ?What? You mean he left for Amsterdam already?? Ray?or maybe it was Roy?pulled open the shiny chrome door of the pizza oven and in one expert motion slipped two hot slices onto a double layer of paper plates and slid them across the counter in Nate?s direction. ?Sorry, buddy,? he said only half sympathetically. ?But from now on we sell pizza and soda andonly pizza and soda. Got it?? Nate picked up the plate of pizza and then put it down on the counter again. He couldn?t believe his bad luck. He pulled out his wallet and removed a ten-dollar bill from the fat wad inside. ?Keep the change,? he muttered, dropping the bill on the counter before leaving with his pizza. Out on the street, he wandered aimlessly toward the park, feeling like an abandoned dog. He?d been buying weed from Mitchell ever since eighth grade. One random May afternoon, Nate and his buddy Jeremy Scott Tompkinson had gone into the pizza place to buy a slice, and Mitchell had overheard Jeremy daring Nate to steal the container of oregano so they could take it home and smoke it. Mitchell had proposed to sell them something even more mood-enhancing, and Nate and his buddies had been coming back ever since. What was he supposed to do now, buy dime bags from one of those random, shifty-looking dudes in Central Park? Most of those guys sold crappy, dry, Texas-grown stuff anyway, not the succulent green buds Mitchell got directly from his uncle in Peru. Besides, he?d heard half the Central Park dealers were narcs just waiting to bust a kid like him. Dumping his half-eaten pizza slices in the nearest garbage can, Nate dug into the pockets of his Hugo Boss naval officer?style coat, searching for a leftover roach. When he found one he crossed Fifth Avenue and crouched on a park bench to light it, ignoring the group of giggling tenth-grade girls in dark blue Constance Billard uniforms ogling him lustily as they walked by. With his I-know-I?m-hot smile, his golden brown hair, his emerald green eyes, his always-tanned skin, and his sexy expertise in building and racing sailboats, Nate Archibald was the most lusted-after boy on the Upper East Side. He didn?t have to go looking for girls. They just fell into his lap. Literally. Nate sucked hard on the burning roach and pulled his cell phone out of his pocket. The problem was, his other stoner St. Jude?s buddies?Jeremy Scott Tompkinson, Charlie Dern, and Anthony Avuldsen?all bought from Mitchell, too. Mitchell was the best. But it was worth calling just to find out if any of them had managed to score a big stash before their dealer had disappeared. Jeremy was in a cab on his way to an interschool squash club game at the Ninety-second Street Y. ?Sorry, dude,? his voice crackled over the line. ?I?ve been doing mom?s Zoloft all day. Why don?t you just buy a dime bag from one of those dealers in the park or something?? Nate shrugged. Something about buying a dime bag in the park seemed so . . .lame . ?Whatever, man,? he told Jeremy. ?See you tomorrow.? Charlie was in the Virgin megastore, buying DVDs with his little brother. ?Bummer,? he said when Nate told him about the situation. ?But you?re right near the park, right? Just buy a dime bag.? ?Yeah, whatever,? Nate replied. ?See you tomorrow.? Anthony was having a driving lesson in the new BMW M3 sports car his parents had given him for his eighteenth birthday last weekend. ?Check your mom?s medicine cabinet,? he advised. ?Parents are the ultimate resource.? ?I?ll look into it,? Nate answered. ?Later.? He clicked off and sucked the last drag off his puny little roach. ?Damn!? he cursed, flicking the charred remnants into the dirty snow beneath his feet. This semester was supposed to have been a twenty-four-hour party. He?d had an awesome interview at Brown in November, and he was pretty sure his application rocked hard enough to get him in. Plus he was no longer hanging out with little Jenny Humphrey, who was very sweet and had a great rack, but who?d taken up a shitload of his free time. For the rest of senior year Nate had been planning to smoke up, kick back, and just stay mellow until graduation, but without his trusty dealer, that plan was basically moot. Nate sat back on the green wooden bench and gazed up at the sumptuous limestone apartment buildings lining Fifth Avenue. To his right, he could just see the corner of Blair?s Seventy-second Street apartment building. Up in the penthouse, Blair?s Russian Blue cat, Kitty Minky, was probably lying stretched out on Blair?s rose-colored bedspread, eagerly waiting for Blair to come home and scratch him under the chin with her coral-pink nails. Impulsively, Nate pushed the buttons on his phone to speed-dial Blair?s cell phone. It rang six times before she finally picked up. ?Hello?? Blair answered in a clipped voice. She was seated in Garren?s new East Fifty-seventh Street salon, which was decorated like a Turkish harem?s lair. Gauzy pink-and-yellow silk scarves hung from the ceiling, and huge pink-and-yellow-upholstered pillows were tossed at random around the salon for clients to lounge on and sip Turkish coffee while they waited for their appointments. In front of every stylist?s station was an enormous gilt-framed mirror. Gianni, Blair?s new hairdresser, had just finished combing out her freshly washed and conditioned locks. With her cell phone pressed against her damp ear, Blair stared at her reflection in the mirror. The critical moment was here: Did she dare go short? ?Hey. It?s me, Nate,? she heard an old familiar voice murmur in her ear. Blair was too stunned to answer. They hadn?t spoken since New Year?s Eve, and even then the conversation had ended badly. What was Nate doing calling hernow ? ?Nate?? Blair replied, half-impatiently, half-curiously. ?Is this really important, because I can?t really talk. It?s kind of avery bad time.? ?Nah, it?s not important,? Nate responded as he tried to come up with a reasonable explanation for why he?d called her in the first place. ?I just thought you?d want to know I?ve decided to quit. You know?quit smoking weed.? He kicked at a clump of frozen dirt. He wasn?t even sure if that was true. Was hereally quitting? Forgood ? Blair gripped the phone in confused silence on the other end. Nate had always been random?especially when he was stoned?but neverthis random. Gianni tapped his tortoise-shell comb against the back of her chair impatiently. ?Well, good for you,? she responded finally. ?Look, I have to go, okay?? Blair sounded distracted, and Nate wasn?t even sure why he?d called her in the first place. ?See you,? he mumbled, tucking his phone back into his coat pocket. ?Bye.? Blair tossed her silvery pink Nokia phone into her red bowling bag and sat up straight in the leather swivel chair. ?I?m ready,? she told Gianni, trying to sound confident. ?Just remember, I want it short butfeminine .? Amused creases appeared in Gianni?s tanned, intentionally stubbly cheeks. He winked a long-lashed, dark brown eye. ?Jes lika Katerina Hepburn. Right??&nbsp; Uh-oh. Blair tightened the belt on her beige salon robe and glared at Gianni?s overly pomaded black hair in the mirror, praying he wasn?t as stupid and incompetent as he sounded. Maybe it was a just a language thing. ?No,not Katherine Hepburn. AudreyHepburn. You know, likeBreakfast at Tiffany?s ?My Fair Lady ?Funny Face ?? Blair searched her brain for a more current celebrity reference, someone with a decent short haircut. ?Or maybe like Selma Blair,? she added desperately, even though Selma?s haircut was more tomboyish than what she had in mind. Gianni didn?t respond. Instead, he ran his fingers through Blair?s damp brown tresses. ?Sucha bee-ootiful ?air,? he said wistfully as he picked up his scissors and gathered her hair in his fist. Then, without further ado, he lopped the entire pony-tail off with one brutal snip. Blair closed her eyes as the rope of hair fell to the floor.Please make me look pretty, she prayed silently,and sophisticated and poised and elegant . She opened her eyes and stared in horror at her reflection. Her wet, blunt, ear-length mop was sticking out in all directions. ?Don?t worry,? Gianni reassured her as he exchanged his big scissors for a small pair of shears. ?Now we shape.? Blair took a deep breath, steeling herself. It was too late to back out of it anyway. Most of her hair was on the floor. ?Okay,? she gasped. Then her cell phone rang again and she lunged at it. ?Wait,? she told Gianni. ?Hello?? ?Yes, is this Blair Waldorf? Harold?s daughter?? Blair studied herself in the mirror. She wasn?t exactly surewho she was anymore. She looked more like a new inmate getting her preprison crop than the daughter of notorious corporate lawyer Harold Waldorf, who?d divorced Blair?s mother two years ago and now lived in a chateau in France, where he ran a vineyard with his ?life partner,? who just happened to be a man. Considering the turbulent state of her present existence, Blair really wouldn?t have minded being someone completely different, which was part of the reason she?d decided to submit herself to Gianni in the first place. She?d even settle for Katherine instead of Audrey as long as the look was totally new. ?Yes,? Blair answered feebly. ?Good,? the guy on the phone replied. His voice was deep and cajoling, making it hard to guess how old he was. Nineteen or thirty-five? ?This is Owen Wells. Your father mentored me at the firm when I was first starting out. We?re both Yalies, and I understand you?re interested in going there yourself.? Interested?Blair wasn?t justinterested in going to Yale?it was her sole purpose in life. Why the hell else would she be takingfive APs? ?Yes, I am,? she squeaked. She glanced up at Gianni, who was mouthing the words to a cheesy Celine Dion song wafting out of the salon?s sound system. ?I kind of messed up my interview, though.? Actually, she?d kind of told the interviewer her whole life?s sob story and then kind ofkissed him, which was more than kind of a major ?whoops.? ?Well, that?s exactly why I?m calling,? Owen Wells replied, his sexy voice resonating like the bass notes of a cello. ?Your father?s support means a lot to the school, and they want to give you a second chance. I?m volunteering my services as your alumnus interviewer, and the admissions office has already agreed to use my write-up when they review your application, instead of the interview you did back in November.? Blair was dumbstruck. A second chance?it was almost too good to be true. Tired of waiting, Gianni dropped his scissors on the wheeled cart next to Blair?s chair, snatched the latest issue ofVogue out of Blair?s lap, and minced away to complain about her to his colleagues. ?So when are you available?? Owen Wells persisted. Now, Blair wanted to say. But she couldn?t very well ask Owen to sit and watch Gianni cut her hair while he asked her all those boring stereotypical interview questions like, Who are the most influential people in your life? ?Anytime,? she chirped. Then she realized she shouldn?t soundtoo desperate, not when she was supposed to be a total whiz kid with an insane schedule. ?Actually, today is kind of busy for me and tomorrow might be a little crazy, too. Wednesday or Thursday after school would be better.? ?I tend to work pretty late, and I?ve got meetings up the wazoo this week, but how about Thursday night? Around eight-thirty?? ?Fine,? Blair responded eagerly. ?Do you want me to come to your office?? Owen paused. Blair could hear his office chair creak and she imagined him surveying his Philippe Starck?designed Tribeca office with its view of New York Harbor, wondering if it was an appropriate place to meet. She imagined him tall and blond, with a tennis tan, like her father. But Owen Wells would be at least ten years younger than her dad, and so much better looking. She wondered if he knew how cool it was that there was aw in each of his names. ?Why don?t we meet at the Compton Hotel? They?ve got a nice little bar that should be pretty quiet.? He laughed. ?I can buy you a Coke, although your father tells me you prefer Dom Perignon.? Blair?s face burned. Her stupid-ass father?what else had he said? ?Oh, no, Coke is fine,? she stammered. ?Good. I?ll see you Thursday night. I?ll be wearing my Yale tie.? ?I?m looking forward to it.? Blair tried to maintain a businesslike tone despite her vivid Owen-at-the-office fantasy. ?Thank you so much for calling.? She clicked off the phone and looked directly into the gilt mirror in front of her. Her blue eyes already seemed larger and more intense now that she had less hair. If she were really an actress starring in the movie of her life?which was what she always liked to imagine?thiswould be the turning point: the day she transformed her look and began rehearsing for the biggest role of her career. She glanced at her watch. There was only half an hour left before she was due back at Constance for gym. There was no reason to rush back, though, especially not when Bendel?s was only three blocks away and a new dress for meeting Owen Wells on Thursday night was calling her name. It was absolutely worth getting in trouble for cutting gym if her new haircut and new dress were going to help get her into Yale. Gianni was drinking coffee and flirting with the shampoo boys. Blair shot him a menacing look, daring him to fuck up her hair. ?Whenever you?re ready, miss,? he called over in a bored tone, as if he couldn?t have cared less if he cut her hair or not. Blair took a deep breath. She was erasing the past?her failed relationship with Nate, her mother?s revolting new husband and embarrassing pregnancy, her botched Yale interview?and recreating herself in a new image. Yale was giving her a second chance, and from now on she would be the master of her own destiny, writing, directing, and starring in the movie that was her life. She could already see the headline in the Styles section of theNew York Times , featuring her haircut.A headof the Times: Gorgeous B
