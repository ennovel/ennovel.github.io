Elise asked as she rolled a steamed dumpling around in a puddle of soy sauce. To weather the snowstorm, Elise and Jenny had gathered a feast of Chinese food and Oreos and videos they?d never heard of, since everything else at Blockbuster had been rented out. Now they were watching the New York Fashion Week coverage on the Metro Channel in the living room of Jenny?s sprawling, ramshackle Upper West Side apartment. Bizarrely enough, the camera had just panned over the audience at the Better Than Naked show, zooming in on Dan for a moment as he scribbled away furiously in his stupid black notebook. ?Because I?m his little sister,? Jenny answered, stunned that she?d actually just seen her brother?s sallow, sideburned face live on TV. She?d known Dan was going to the show, but she hadn?t even bothered to ask if she could accompany him. He was so obsessed with being Mr. I?m-The-Next-Keats that he barely even noticed her existence anymore. The camera shifted to the Les Best tent in Bryant Park, where Serena van der Woodsen strutted down the runway wearing a cropped white baby tee with I LOVEAARONprinted on it, her gray Constance Billard School uniform skirt, a red wool cape, and Les Best ankle boots. It looked like she was supposed to be a sexy version of Little Red Riding Hood or something. Not that anyone wouldever pay money for a school uniform. ?Hey, isn?t that our peer group leader? Serena van der Woodsen?? Elise pointed out. Jenny stuffed an entire Oreo into her mouth and nodded, her cheeks bulging. It was Serena all right. Looking as perfect as ever. ?Quick, change the channel! There?s no way I can eat anything while I?m looking at those legs,? Elise squealed, tossing a beaded velvet throw pillow at the television. Jenny giggled and turned off the TV altogether. She picked up her I LOVENY mug of Coke, glancing warily at the feast spread out on the old steamer trunk that served as a coffee table. The apartment was so filthy, she worried that at any moment a disgusting lobster-sized cockroach would drop out of the crumbling plaster in the ceiling, right into her cold sesame noodles. She noticed Elise hadn?t actually ingested any food yet. ?You don?t have a problem eating in front of me, do you?? Jenny picked up a pair of chopsticks and twirled them around in the cardboard container of noodles. ?I promise I won?t even look at you.? Elise picked up her dumpling with her fingers and bit it in half. ?That?s just in the lunchroom at school,? she said with her mouth full. ?I can?t eat with all those skinny girls looking at my fat.? ?You?re not fat,? Jenny responded, even though being around Elise actually gave her an appetite because she felt so tiny in comparison. Still, it was kind of a relief to see that Elise didn?t have a real eating disorder, she was just insecure. That was the thing about making a new friend?you were never quite sure if you totallyknew them or not. ?Did you paint that?? Elise asked, pointing to the oil portrait Jenny had painted of her father, which was hanging over the mantel. Rufus was wearing a white V-neck undershirt with cigarette burns in it, and he hadn?t shaved in days. His wiry gray hair stuck out in all directions, and his hazel eyes were wild with caffeine-induced excitement and from doing too much acid in the sixties. It was a pretty accurate portrait. ?Yup.? Jenny wound more noodles around her chopsticks. She hadn?t painted anything since the portraits she?d done of Nate in December. She?d painted his face in every style she?d studied. There was Picasso Nate, Monet Nate, Dali Nate, Warhol Nate, and Pollock Nate. But when Nate had broken her heart, she?d burned them all in a metal trash can out on West Ninety-ninth Street. It had been a moment of catharsis?their love turned to ashes. Actually, now that she thought about it, she should have saved the ashes and made something with them?a self-portrait or a calming seascape?but it was too late now. Elise reached for yet another dumpling. ?Will you paint me?? she asked. Jenny glanced out the smudged living room window. The snow was so thick, it looked like someone was exploding giant down pillows in the sky. ?Sure,? she said, standing up to get her paints. It wasn?t like she had anything better to do. ?Cool!? Elise tossed the remains of the dumpling back into the container and unbuttoned her too-tight Seven jeans. Then she pulled her pink Gap turtleneck over her head, taking her pull-on crop-top bra with it. When Jenny returned with a clean white canvas and her palette of oils, Elise was sprawled out on the couch, her wiry blonde hair dusting her freckled shoulders, completely naked. ?What are you doing?? Jenny demanded, mystified. Elise stretched her arms over her head and settled her head back against the throw pillows. ?I?ve always wanted to pose nude,? she said. ?You know, like that scene in the movieTitanic .? Jenny sat down cross-legged on the floor opposite her and wetted her brush. ?Whatever,? she remarked, frowning at her eager, voluptuous subject. Maybe her new friend was less insecure than she?d first thought. And a lot crazier, too.
