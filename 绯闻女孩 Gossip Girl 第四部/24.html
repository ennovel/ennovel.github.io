<br> &nbsp;Ring, ring! ?Shit!? Jenny threw Elise off of her, leaped off the couch, and sprinted into the kitchen. It wasn?t like anyone could see them, but she still felt like she?d been caught doing something incredibly embarrassing. ?Everything okay?? Rufus growled cheerfully into the phone. ?I?m stuck down here with Max and Lyle and the rest of these losers. The snow?s a bitch.? Rufus spent most Friday nights down in the East Village at an old bar with his Communist writer friends. He sounded jolly, the way he always sounded when he?d had two or three glasses of red wine. ?You girls staying out of trouble??&nbsp; Jenny blushed. ?Uh-huh.? ?Well, tell that friend of yours to stay put. No one in their right mind should try to get anywhere tonight.? Jenny nodded. ?Okay.? She?d been kind of hoping Elise would go home so she could take a hot bath and collect her thoughts, but she couldn?t very well ask her to leave when there were four feet of snow on the ground and it was still coming down. ?I?ll see you later, Daddy,? she said, almost wishing she could tell him how confused she was about what had just happened. She might have been a budding artist but that didn?t mean she had to experimentall the time. Jenny hung up the phone. ?So what should we do now?? Elise asked, wandering into the kitchen with her jeans still unbuttoned. She separated an Oreo and licked the cream out of the inside. Elise seemed to be hinting that she was ready to move on to the next chapter inThis Is My Body for Women , but noway was Jenny going to find out what that entailed. She faked a yawn. ?Dad says he?s coming home soon,? she lied. ?I?m kind of tired anyway.? She glanced out the kitchen window. Everything was white and the snow was still falling. It looked like the end of the world. ?Come on.? She led the way to her bedroom. ?Dad wants you to stay over.? All she had was a single bed that she was definitely not sharing with Elise. Not when Elise was so . . .horny and unpredictable. ?You can sleep on my bed and I?ll sleep on the sofa.? ?Okay,? Elise replied dubiously. ?I better call my mom. You?re not mad at me are you?? ?Mad?? Jenny repeated casually. ?Why would I be mad?? She pulled open her dresser drawer and handed Elise an oversized T-shirt and a pair of sweatpants. ?Sleep in these,? she directed. Otherwise Elise might decide to sleep in the nude, which would be very uncool, especially if Rufus came home later that night and barged into Jenny?s room to give a senseless sermon on the meaning of life, as he was sometimes known to do when he?d drunk too much wine. She pulled out some pajamas for herself and closed the drawer. ?I?m going to take a shower. You can use my cell phone if you want to call your mom.? Elise took the clothes and gazed up at the paintings on Jenny?s wall. Over the bed was one of the Humphreys? cat, Marx, dozing on the stove, painted in thick oils. Marx was a deep turquoise color, and the stove was red. Near the window was a self-portrait of Jenny?s feet, with her toenails painted orange and the bones in her feet painted blue. ?You?re really good.? Elise slipped her jeans down over her knees. ?Don?t you want to finish my portrait?? Jenny grabbed her pink terrycloth bathrobe from the hook on the back of her door. ?Not tonight,? she responded, quickly heading down the hall to the bathroom. She?d take a long, hot shower, and hopefully by the time she came out Elise would be asleep. Tomorrow they would eat their Eggos and go sledding in the park and goof around like normal girls. No more experimentation. As far as Jenny was concerned, experimentation was completely overrated.
