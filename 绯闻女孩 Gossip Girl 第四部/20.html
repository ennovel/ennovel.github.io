DJ Sassy broke out the phat French house beats, and the Harrison Street Club was transformed into a seventies European disco full of half-naked ninety-pound models drinking Cristal champagne straight out of the bottle. Dan stood alone by the bar, sipping his Red Bull?and-who-knew-what-else cocktail. It tasted exactly like baby aspirin and he was only drinking it because the bartender had promised him it was loaded with caffeine and something called taurine, which was guaranteed to keep him hyperawake all night. All of a sudden he noticed a violently tall woman wearing a flaming red bouffant wig?ithad to be a wig?neon pink lipstick, andhuge tortoise-shell sunglasses standing in the middle of the packed room with her hands cupped around her mouth. ?Daniel Humphrey? Calling Daniel Humphrey!? she shrieked. It was Rusty Klein. Dan tilted his head back and downed his drink, blinking his eyes as the caffeine and whatever else was in his drink rushed to his brain all at once. He stumbled over to the woman, his heart thumping even faster than the music. ?I?m Dan,? he croaked. ?Lookatyou ! Our newpoet ! You?readorable !Perfect !? Rusty Klein pushed her enormous sunglasses up on top of her head and jangled the enormous gold bracelets covering her long bony wrists as she grabbed Dan and kissed each of his cheeks. Her perfume smelled oily and acidic, like tuna fish. ?I love you, honey,? she purred, squeezing Dan tight. Dan shrank away, unused to being manhandled by someone he?d only just met. He hadn?t expected Rusty Klein to be soscary . Her eyebrows had been dyed to match her wig and she was dressed like a sword fighter, in a form-fitting black velvet Better Than Naked puffy-sleeved jacket and matching black velvet bullfighting pants. A rope of black pearls clung to her pale, bony cleavage. ?I?ve been trying to write more poems,? Dan stammered. ?You know, for my book?? ?Wonderful!? Rusty Klein shouted, thrusting her lips at him again and probably smearing bright pink lipstick all over his face. ?Let?s make a lunch date sometime next week.? ?Um, I?ve got school all day every day next week, but I get out at three-thirty.? ?School!?Rusty screamed. ?You?re socute ! We can do tea then. Call my office and have Buckley, my assistant, set it up. Oh, fuck me!? She clasped Dan?s arm with a clawlike hand. Her fingernails were at least three inches long and painted orangey pink. ?There?s someone here you absolutelymust meet.? Rusty let go of Dan and held out her arms to receive a frail-looking girl with a long, sad face and dirty blond hair. The girl was wearing only a see-through light pink slip over her gaunt frame and her lank, waist-length hair was uncombed, as if she?d just gotten out of bed. ?Mystery Craze, this is Daniel Humphrey. Daniel, this is Mystery,? Rusty purred loudly. ?Mystery, honey, you remember that poem I gave you to read? The one you said . . . Oh, fuck me. I?ll letyou tell him what you said. Now if you?ll excuse me, I?m going to go lick my favorite designer?s ass so he?ll give me some new free clothes. Love you both. Ciao!? she added, before striding away in her five-inch black stilettos. Mystery blinked her huge, tired gray eyes. She looked like she?d been up all night cleaning floors, like Cinderella. ?Your poem saved my life,? she confided to Dan in a low, husky voice. A tall, narrow glass of something bright red was wedged into her frail hand. ?It?s Campari,? she said when she noticed him looking at it. ?Want a taste?? Dan never drank anything that wasn?t caffeinated. He shook his head no and tucked his black notebook under his arm. Then he lit a Camel and took a long drag. There, that was much better. Now at least he?d have something to do, even if he couldn?t think of anything to say. ?So, are you a poet, too?? he asked. Mystery stuck her thumb into her drink and then licked it off. The corners of her mouth were stained red with Campari, making her look like a little girl who?d just eaten a cherry Popsicle. ?I write poems and short stories. And I?m working on a novel about cremation and premature death. Rusty says I?m the next Sylvia Plath,? she answered. ?What about you?? Dan sipped his drink. He wasn?t sure what she meant by premature death. Was there ever a right time to die? He wondered if he should write a poem about it, but then again, he didn?t want to steal Mystery?s material. ?I?m supposed to be the next Keats.? Mystery dunked her thumb into her drink again and then licked it off. ?What?s your favorite verb?? Dan took another drag off his cigarette and blew smoke into the crowded, noisy room. He wasn?t sure if it was the club, or the music, or the caffeine, or the taurine, but he felt so alive andso good at that very moment, talking about words with this girl named Mystery whose life he had saved. He was seriously digging it. ?Dying, I guess,? he answered, finishing his drink and setting the empty glass down on the floor. ?The verbto die .? He knew it must have sounded like he was trying to impress her. After all, she was writing a book about premature death and cremation. But it was the truth. Almost all of his poems really were about dying. Dying of love, dying of anger, dying of boredom, of anxiety; falling asleep and never waking up. Mystery smiled. ?Me too.? Her gray eyes and long, thin face were starkly beautiful, but her front teeth were crooked and yellow, like she?d never been to the dentist in her entire life. She snagged another Red Bull cocktail from a waiter?s tray and handed it to Dan. ?Rusty says poets are the next movie stars. One day we?ll both be riding around in limos with our bodyguards.? She sighed heavily. ?As if that will make life any easier.? She raised her glass and clinked it against his. ?To poetry,? she announced grimly. Then she grabbed the back of Dan?s head and pulled him toward her, crushing his lips in a deep, Campari-soaked kiss. Dan knew he should have thrown Mystery off, protesting that he had a girlfriend, that he was in love. He shouldn?t have enjoyed being hit on by a strange, practically naked girl with yellow teeth. But Mystery?s lips tasted sweet and sour at the same time and he wanted to understand why she was so sad and so tired. He wanted todiscover her, the way he sometimes discovered the perfect metaphor when he was in the middle of writing a poem, and to do that he had to keep kissing her. ?What?s your favorite noun?? he breathed into her ear when he came up for air. ?Sex,? she answered, diving for his lips again. Dan grinned as he kissed her back. It might have been the taurine, but sometimes it just feels good to be bad.
