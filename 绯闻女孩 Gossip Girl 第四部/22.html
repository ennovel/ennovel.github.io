The room was luxurious, with a king-sized bed, a sunken Jacuzzi tub, a flat-screen plasma TV hanging on the wall, and an impressive view of the partially frozen, white-washed Hudson River. Owen called room service and ordered a bottle of Veuve Clicquot, filet mignon, pommes frites, and chocolate mousse cake, and when it came they lay on the bed, feeding each other cake and watchingTop Gun on TNT. ?How come you and your wife split up?? Blair asked, forking a piece of cake into Owen?s open mouth. Chocolatey crumbs fell onto the white 450-thread-count Egyptian cotton pillowcases. Owen dipped a teaspoon into the cake?s frosting and offered the spoon to Blair to lick off. ?We haven?t. . . .? He hesitated, his gorgeous, shapely eyebrows furrowing as he considered his answer. ?I?d really rather not talk about it.? Blair smiled sympathetically as she let the frosting melt on her tongue. She liked playing the role of the other woman. It made her feel so . . .powerful . Across the room on the huge flat-screen TV Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis were making out on his motorcycle. ?Did she go to Yale, too?? Owen picked up the remote and pointed it at the television. Then he put it down again without changing the channel. ?I don?t know,? he replied, sounding exactly like Blair?s little brother, Tyler, when he was watching TV and their mom asked if he?d done his homework yet. Blair grabbed the remote and began flipping through the channels. AFriends rerun. Wrestling. MTVCribs . She wasn?t sure if she liked the boyish side of Owen. She much preferred theman . ?She didn?t go to Yale or she did?? ?Uh-huh,? Owen answered, spooning a huge bit of cake into his mouth. ?Astronomy major.? Blair raised her eyebrows as she watched Sean ?P. Diddy? Combs give a tour of his Upper East Side manse. Owen?s wife sounded like a genius. What kind of person became an astronomy major anyway? Someone who wanted to be an astronaut? She wished Owen had said his wife hadn?t gone to college at all, but that she just sat around watching dog shows on TV and eating Krispy Kreme donuts. That in the end she?d weighed five hundred pounds and he?d been forced to sleep in the guest bedroom until eventually moving out altogether. There just hadn?t been room for him anymore. Blair flipped over to AMC, her favorite classic movie channel.Casablanca , starring Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart, was almost halfway through. The Germans had just invaded Paris and Ingrid was frightened. She settled back on the pillows, missing the way her long hair used to fan out around her face in a way she imagined must have been irresistible. ?Sometimes I pretend I?m living in those times,? she told Owen dreamily. ?It just seems so much more sophisticated, you know? No one wears jeans, everyone is so polite, and all the women have the best hair-styles.? ?Yeah, but there was a war. A big one,? Owen reminded her. He wiped his mouth on a white linen napkin and settled back against the pillows beside her. ?So?? Blair insisted. ?It was still better.? Owen reached for her hand and Blair shifted her gaze away from the TV to study his profile. ?You know you look exactly like Cary Grant?? she whispered. ?You think?? Owen turned his head to look at her, his blue eyes smoldering sexily. ?I cut my hair to look like Audrey Hepburn,? Blair admitted. She turned on her side and rested her head against his manly chest in its crisp white shirt. ?We could be Audrey and Cary.? Owen kissed her hair and squeezed her hand gently. ?Here?s looking at you, kid,? he murmured. With his free hand he began to rub her back and Blair could feel his gold wedding band knock against the bumps in her spine. Outside the snow was falling harder than ever. Blair watched it fall, unable to relax. It was sort of impossible not to think about Owen?s genius astronaut wife, sitting home alone as she wrote out impossible astronomical equations on a blackboard, all the while wondering about her husband. Even if Blair and Owen did look exactly like Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant, Blair was pretty sure the nice girls Audrey played didn?t lose their virginities in hotel rooms with married older men, no matter how deep the snow got. Why not end the film here, while it was still good? Owen was breathing deeply now and had stopped rubbing her back. As soon as Blair was sure he was asleep, she?d slip out the door and ask the concierge downstairs to call her a car home. After all, she had a reputation to maintain. And it wasn?t like she was ditching him. The best way to keep a guy intrigued is to disappear.
