A beautiful, tanned, blond dude dressed in baggy orange surf shorts, white leather Birkenstock clogs, and a brown-and-white pony fur vest with nothing on underneath smiled at Vanessa with glistening white teeth. His name was Dork or Duke or something and he claimed to be a producer. ?The genius filmmaker.? ?She?s the next Bertolucci,? Ken Mogul corrected Duke, or whatever his name was. ?Give me a year and she?s going to be a household name.? Ken was dressed like an urban cowboy in a silver Culture of Humanity down vest over a black Western-style shirt with pearly white snaps instead of buttons. His curly red hair was tucked into a black Stetson hat, and he was even wearing black cowboy boots with his Culture of Humanity boot-cut jeans. He?d flown into New York that night from Utah, where his most recent film had just been introduced at the Sundance Film Festival. It was an ambitious piece about a deaf and mute man who worked in a cannery in Alaska and lived in a trailer with thirty-six cats. The man didn?t talk and spent a lot of time at his computer e-mailing girls on singles Web sites, so Ken had had to be extremely creative with the camera to keep the action going. It was his finest work yet. ?Dude, watching your film was like being born again,? Dork told Vanessa. ?It made my day.? The corners of Vanessa?s mouth turned up in a half-bored, half-amused Mona Lisa smile. She wasn?t sure how she felt about being called ?dude,? but she was glad she?d made Dork?s day. The Culture of Humanity by Jedediah Angel after-party was an even bigger deal than the fashion show itself. Highway 1 had been decorated like a Hindu wedding tent, and bikini-clad models who hadn?t even been in the show were lounging on leather sofas, drinking saffron martinis. or dancing to the live bhangra music. Vanessa tugged on her tight red top. It was kind of hard not to feel like a porker around so many bony, seven-foot-tall models. ?Okay. Here?s the guy fromEntertainment Weekly ,? Ken Mogul said, wrapping his arm around her waist. ?Smile, it?s a photo op!? Duke stood on the other side of Vanessa and pressed his tanned, angular cheek against her soft, pale one. He smelled like Coppertone. ?Say salami!? It was Vanessa?s policynot to smile when she was being forced to have her picture taken, but why not? There really wasn?t any danger that she?d get swept up in the glow, marry Duke in the Temple of Surf and Sand, and live cheesily ever after in a surf shack?cum?film studio on the beach in Malibu. She was too hard-core New York for that, and besides, she hated the beach. No, tonight would be her one night of cheese and then tomorrow she?d go back to being normal again. ?Salami!? all three of them cried, flashing their cheesiest smiles for the camera. Duke stayed close to Vanessa?s side after the photographer left. ?What hotel are you staying at?? he asked, assuming she was from LA, just like everyone else he knew. Vanessa unscrewed the cap on her bottle of Evian and took a swig. ?Actually, I live here in New York, in Williamsburg, with my sister. I?m still in high school. She plays in a band.? Dork looked excited. ?Dude!? he cried. ?You?re like one of those people screenwriters make up, you know?? He lifted his fingers to make quotations in the air, ?An ?urban hipster.? Except you?rereal . You?re realer than real. You?re dyno-mite!? For a guy called Dork, he was actually pretty insightful. ?Thanks,? Vanessa said, unsure whether that was the correct response or not. She?d never had a conversation with someone so stupid before. She felt a hand on her elbow and she turned around. A frail older man wearing a purple velvet smoking jacket and round black glasses smiled up at her. ?You?re the film-maker, right?? he asked. Vanessa nodded. ?I guess.? The old man waggled a bony finger at her. ?Don?t take your gift too seriously,? he said before wandering away. Duke bent down and spoke urgently into her ear. ?I?m staying at the Hudson. Wanna go back to my room for a drink or something?? Vanessa knew she should have told him to fuck off, but she?d never been hit on by a gorgeous, dumb surfer dude who could have hit on any one of the models in the room but had chosen to hit on her instead. It was really kind of flattering. And hadn?t that old guy just told her not to take things too seriously? Thank God she?d gone to all the trouble to remove the hair on her legs. ?Maybe later,? she replied, not wanting to shut Dork down completely. ?It?s kind of snowy out right now.? ?Right, duh.? Duke slapped himself on the head with a goofy laugh. ?Want to dance instead?? He held out his hand, his arm muscles rippling invitingly. He looked like he never missed a workout and survived on a diet of protein drinks and wheatgrass. Vanessa tugged on her red shirt again and took Duke?s hand, following him out onto the throbbing, crowded dance floor. She couldn?t believe herself?shehated to dance! At least no one she knew would be watching.&nbsp; Oh yeah?
