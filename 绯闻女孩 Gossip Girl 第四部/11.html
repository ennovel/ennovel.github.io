We?re supposed to get four feet by midnight!? Jackie Davis, Nate?s teen group facilitator at the Breakaway Rehabilitation Center, rubbed her hands together as if the idea of being snowed in with all these rich derelicts was her idea of a rocking good time. After Nate had gotten busted in the park, his father and Saul Burns, the family lawyer, had come to fetch him at the precinct. Nate?s father, a stern, silver-haired navy captain who handled emergencies with crisp, efficient formality, had paid the fine of three thousand dollars and cosigned an agreement that Nate would immediately attend a drug rehabilitation program for a minimum of ten hours per week. That meant Nate was going to have to ride the train out to Greenwich, Connecticut, five days a week for counseling and group therapy. ?Just think of it as a job, son,? Saul Burns had tried to reassure him. ?An after-school job.? Captain Archibald hadn?t said anything. It was pretty clear that Nate had disappointed him beyond words. Luckily Nate?s mother had been in Monte Carlo visiting her thrice-divorced sister. When Nate had relayed the sordid tale over the phone she?d shrieked and wept, smoked five cigarettes in rapid succession, and then broken her champagne glass. She was always a little dramatic. After all, she was French. ?All right. Let?s start out by going around the circle,? Jackie instructed in a sunny voice, as if this were the first day of nursery school. ?Tell us your name and explain why you?re here. Keep it short, please.? She nodded at Nate to start, since he was sitting directly to her right. Nate shifted uncomfortably in his Eames chair. All the furniture at the posh Greenwich, Connecticut, rehab clinic was twentieth-century modern, to match the minimalist beige and white d?cor. The floor was cream-colored Italian marble, crisp white linen curtains covered the floor-to-ceiling windows, and the staff wore beige linen uniforms designed especially by nineties denim impresario Gunner Gass, a former patient who was now on the facility?s board. ?Okay. My name?s Nathaniel Archibald, but everyone calls me Nate,? Nate mumbled. He kicked at the legs of his chair and cleared his throat. ?I got busted a few days ago buying weed in Central Park. That?s why I?m here.? ?Thank you, Nate,? Jackie interrupted. She smiled a frosty, brown-lipsticked smile and made a note on the pad in her clipboard. ?We prefer it here at Breakaway if you call the substance in question by its true name. In your case, marijuana. If you can use its name consistently, you are making one more step toward your freedom from it.? She smiled at Nate once more. ?Would you like to try again?? Nate glanced self-consciously at the other losers in the group. There were seven of them altogether, three guys and four girls, all staring at the floor, worrying about what they were going to say and looking just as uncomfortable as he felt. ?I?m Nate,? Nate repeated mechanically. ?A narc caught me buyingmarijuana in the park. That?s why I?m here.? Across the circle a girl with dark brown hair that hung down almost to her waist, bloodred lips, and skin so pale it was almost blue gazed at him soulfully, like a coked-up version of Snow White. ?Better,? Jackie said. ?Next.? She nodded at the Japanese girl sitting next to Nate. ?My name is Hannah Koto and I took Ecstasy before school two weeks ago and got caught because I laid down on the floor to feel the rug in my trig class.? Everybody laughed except for Jackie. ?Thank you, Hannah, that was fine. Next.? Nate tuned the next two people out, kind of grooving on the way Snow White was jiggling her foot, like she was keeping time to her own private concert. She was wearing light blue suede boots that looked like they?d never been worn outside. Suddenly it was her turn. ?My name is Georgina Spark. Everyone calls me Georgie. I guess I?m here because I wasn?t very nice to my father before he croaked, so I have to wait until I turn eighteen before I can live my life the way I want to.? The rest of the group tittered nervously. Jackie frowned. ?Can you name the substance you were found abusing, Georgina?? ?Cocaine,? Georgie answered, letting a curtain of dark hair fall over her face. ?I sold my favorite show horse to buy fifty grams. It was in the papers and everything.New York Post , Thursday, February?? ?Thank you,? Jackie interrupted. ?Next group member please.? Still jiggling her foot, Georgie glanced up through her hair and met Nate?s intrigued gaze with a mischievous bloodred smile. ?Bitch,? she mouthed, obviously referring to Jackie. Nate grinned back and nodded his chin ever so slightly. Saul Burns had told him to treat rehab like an after-school job. Now he had a reason to work hard at it.
