Zeke Freedman greeted Dan as fourth-period U.S. history was about to begin. He handed Dan a pink paper shopping bag. ?Aggie asked me to give this to you. A messenger just brought it to the front desk.? The handles of the bag were tied with red satin ribbon. Dan tugged on the bow and emptied the contents of the bag out onto his desk: a small white box and a slim red leather book. Inside the white box was a stubby silver pen on a silver chain. A card inside the box described it as an antigravity pen, the kind used by astronauts in space. Dan put the chain around his neck and opened the leather book up to the first page where someone had scrawled a note:Kick gravity?s ass, you charmer. Dig? Dan reread the note, completely dumbfounded. It was too bizarre for Vanessa, which meant it was definitely from Mystery. The final bell rang and Mr. Dube strode into the room and started erasing the blackboard. Dan tucked the bag of presents under his seat and opened his notebook, pretending to listen to what Mr. Dube was saying about Vietnam and apathy. School seemed so lame and inconsequential when a big-time agent like Rusty Klein wanted to represent him, and an obviously brilliant, intriguingly sexy poet had sent him those exquisitely astute Valentine?s Day gifts. Then Dan remembered Vanessa and his hands began to tremble. He hadn?t sent her anything for Valentine?s Day? not that Vanessa was at all into such a ?commercial bullshit holiday,? as she called it, but he hadn?t even called her. Actually, his biggest problem was . . . he?d cheated on her. And not just kissing cheating either.Cheating cheating.&nbsp; Whoops. It was all Mystery?s fault. With her see-through slip and crooked yellow teeth she?d made him feel like he was living inside of one of his poems, kissing a beguilingly odd girl he?d created at a raucous, screwball party he?d invented. He hadn?t been able to help but let his imagination run amok, sending him stumbling across the snowy landscape to her ramshackle Chinatown studio apartment and making love to her in all sorts of odd yogalike positions on her uncomfortable futon bed as the sun was rising over the bleak, snow-covered city. It was almost as if none of it had actuallyhappened . It wasfiction . Except it wasn?t fiction. He?d cheated. Dan had been dreadfully hungover for the remainder of the weekend and too deeply mired in existential guilt and self-loathing to answer Vanessa?s countless messages on his cell phone. He flipped to the back of his history notebook. What if he wrote Vanessa a poem and e-mailed it to her during lunch next period? That would be more meaningful than flowers or chocolate or a cheesy Valentine?s Day card. The best thing about it was that he wouldn?t have to talk to her and possibly admit that he?d cheated on her, because he?d never been any good at telling lies. Mr. Dube was writing on the board now. Dan pretended to makes notes in his notebook. Chalk angels,he wrote.Making meaning. Then he thought about something Mystery had said when they were drinking their fourth or fifth Red Bull cocktails. Something about how she was tired of writing obscure poems that skirted around what she was really trying to say. Subtle was out. Direct was in. Kiss me. Be mine.Dan wrote, imitating the little slogans on those candy hearts girls were always passing around on Valentine?s Day.Hot stuff! He reread the words without really seeing them. His mind was still too full of his night with Mystery to process anything else. Her stringy dirty blond hair had smelled like toast and when she?d touched his bare stomach with her cold, clammy hands, his whole body had rippled. He?d never even asked her what she meant by premature death or how his poem ?Sluts? had saved her life, but he?d been so intoxicated by the taurine in the Red Bull and by her appallingly yellow teeth, he probably wouldn?t have remembered anyway. Lost my virginity again,Dan wrote, which was the truth. Doing it with Mystery was like losing it again. Was it possible that every time he made love to a new woman it would feel that way? Before he could imagine who the next lucky girl would be, the bell rang and Dan snapped out of his reverie, slapping the notebook closed and tucking it under his arm. ?Hey,? he called to Zeke. ?I?ll buy you some sushi for lunch if you wait for me to whip off an e-mail in the lab.? ?Okay.? Zeke shrugged, trying not to look too excited that his old friend was actually deigning to pay attention to him again. Since when did Dan Humphrey, king of cheap egg rolls and bad coffee, eatsushi ? ?Heard you got lucky Friday night!? Chuck Bass shouted Dan?s way as they passed each other on the stairwell. Chuck was wearing his Riverside Prep uniform navy blue V-neck sweater with nothing on underneath it. ?Nice work.? ?Thanks,? Dan muttered, hurrying upstairs to the computer lab. He was kidding himself if he thought Vanessa wasn?t going to find out about him and Mystery, but as soon as she received his latest poem he was convinced she?d forgive him. Just as Mystery had written in her note?he was a charmer.
