Daniel Humphrey asked his best friend and girlfriend of six weeks, Vanessa Abrams. Dan attended renowned Upper West Side boys school Riverside Prep, while Vanessa attended Constance Billard, but they had gotten permission to collaborate on a special senior project calledMaking Poetry . Vanessa, a budding film director, was going to film Dan, a budding poet and occasional star of Vanessa?s films, writing and revising his poems. Not exactly box-office-smash material, but Dan was so cute in a scruffy, rumpled, angst-ridden-artist sort of way that people would probably want to see it anyway. ?Just sit down at your desk and write something in one of those black notebooks like you always do,? Vanessa instructed, peering through the lens of her digital video camera to see if the light was okay. ?Can you clear some of that shit off your desk?? Dan swept his arm over the desk and sent pens, paper clips, scraps of paper, rubber bands, books, empty packs of unfiltered Camels, matchbooks, and empty Coke cans crashing to the brown-carpeted floor. They were filming in Dan?s room because that was where he usually worked. Besides, it was a straight shot through the park from Constance Billard on East Ninety-third Street between Fifth and Madison to Dan?s apartment building on West Ninety-ninth Street and West End Avenue. ?And maybe take your shirt off, too,? Vanessa suggested.Making Poetry was going to be about the artistic process, illustrating that whatdoesn?t go into the work is just as important as what does. There would be lots of shots of Dan crumpling up paper and throwing it angrily across the room. Vanessa wanted to show that writing?or creating anything, for that matter?wasn?t just a mental exercise: it wasphysical . Plus, Dan had these great little muscles in his back that she couldn?t wait to get on film. Dan stood up and peeled off his plain black T-shirt, tossing it onto his unmade bed where the Humphreys? fat old cat, Marx, lay asleep on his back like a furry beached whale. Everything about the apartment Dan shared with his father, Rufus, an editor of lesser-known Beat poets, and his little sister, Jenny, was unmade, falling apart, or at the very least completely covered with cat hair and dust bunnies. It was a large, bright, high-ceilinged apartment, but it hadn?t been properly cleaned in twenty years, and the crumbling walls were gasping for a new coat of paint. Dan and his father and sister rarely threw anything away, either, so the sagging furniture and scratched wooden floors were strewn with old newspapers and magazines, out-of-print books, incomplete decks of cards, used batteries, and unsharpened pencils. It was the kind of place where your coffee got cat hair in it the minute you poured it, which was a problem Dan dealt with constantly because he was completely addicted to caffeine. ?Do you want me to face the camera?? he asked, sitting down on his worn wooden desk chair and swiveling it toward Vanessa. ?I could hold the notebook in my lap and write like this,? he demonstrated. Vanessa knelt down and squinted through the camera lens. She was wearing her gray pleated Constance Billard uniform with black tights, and the brown shag carpet felt bristly against her knees. ?Yes, that?s nice,? she murmured. Oh, just look how pale and smooth Dan?s chest was! She could see every rib, and that nice line of tawny peach fuzz that ran up his belly to his navel! She inched forward on her knees, trying to get as close as possible without ruining the frame. Dan bit the end of his pen, smiled to himself, and then wrote,She?s got a shaved head, she wears black all the time, she needs a new pair of combat boots, and she hates to wear makeup. But she?s the kind of girl who believes in you and secretly gets your best poem published in The New Yorker. I guess you could say I love her. It was probably the corniest thing he?d ever written, but it wasn?t like he was going to publish it in his ?Greatest Works? or anything. Vanessa inched forward some more, trying to capture the fervent white of Dan?s knuckles as he scribbled away. ?What are you writing?? She pressed the record-sound button on her camera. Dan looked up, grinning at her through his messy bangs, his golden brown eyes shining. ?It?s not a poem. It?s just a little story about you.? Vanessa felt her whole body warm up. ?Read it out loud.? Dan scratched his chin self-consciously and then cleared his throat. ?Okay. ?She?s got a shaved head . . . ,?? he began, reading what he?d written. Vanessa blushed as she listened and then dropped the camera on the floor. She walked on her knees over to where Dan was sitting, pushed his notebook out of the way, and laid her head in his lap. ?You know how we?re always talking about having sex but we?ve never done it?? she whispered, her lips brushing the rough cloth of his army-green cargo pants. ?Why don?t we do it right now?? Beneath her cheek she felt Dan?s thigh muscle tighten. ?Now?? He looked down and traced his finger along the edge of Vanessa?s ear. She had four piercings in each ear, but none of them had earrings in them. He took a deep breath. He?d been saving sex for a moment when it seemed poetic andright . Maybe that time wasright now , a spontaneous moment. It seemed especially apt and ironic when in exactly an hour he?d be back at Riverside Prep, sitting in last-period AP Latin, listening to Dr. Werd read Ovid in his over-the-top Latin-nerd accent. Introducing double-free-period sex?the latest offering on the spring curriculum. ?Okay,? Dan agreed. ?Let?s do it.?
