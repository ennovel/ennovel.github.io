<p>He had therefore, at some length, detailed the motives that influenced him in its composition. He had shown that as a solitary companionless bushman, it had been a pleasure to him in his lone evenings</p>  
<p>He had expatiated on the love he bears his adopted country, and had stated that he was greatly influenced by the hope that although</p> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sparta hath many a worthier son than he,"</p> 
<p>this work might be the humble cornerstone to some enduring and highly ornamented structure.</p> 
<p>The author however fortunately remembered, that readers have but little sympathy with the motives of authors; but expect that their works should amuse or instruct them. He will therefore content himself, with giving a quotation from one of those old authors, whose "well of English undefined" shames our modern writers.</p> 
<p>He intreats that the indulgence prayed for by the learned Cowell may be accorded to his humble efforts.</p> 
<p>"My true end is the advancement of knowledge, and therefore have I published this poor work, not only to impart the good thereof, to those young ones that want it, but also to draw from the learned, the supply of my defects.</p> 
<p>"Whosoever will charge these travails with many oversights, he shall need no solemn pains to prove them.</p> 
<p>"And upon the view taken of this book sithence the impression, I dare assure them, that shall observe most faults therein, that I, by gleaning after him, will gather as many omitted by him, as he shall shew committed by me.</p> 
<p>"What a man saith well is not, however, to be rejected, because he hath some errors; reprehend who will, in God's name, that is, with sweetness, and without reproach.</p> 
<p>"So shall he reap hearty thanks at my hands, and thus more soundly help in a few months, than I by tossing and tumbling my books at home, could possibly have done in some years."</p>
