Hardly a breath fanned the sails, as the vessel slowly glided between the Calabrian and Sicilian coasts, approaching quite close to the former.</p> 
<p>The party, seated on chairs placed on the deck, gazed in a spirit of placid enjoyment on one of those scenes, which the enthusiastic traveller often recals, as in his native clime, he pines for foreign lands, and for novel impressions. The sun was setting over the purple peaks of the Calabrian mountains, smiling in sunny gladness on deep ravines, whose echoes few human feet now woke, save those of simple peasant, or lawless bandit. Where the orb of day held its declining course, the sky wore a hue of burnished gold; its rich tint alone varied, by one fleecy violet cloud, whose outline of rounded beauty, was marked by a clear cincture of white,</p> 
<p>On their right, beneath the mountain, lay the little village of Capo del Marte, a perfect specimen of Italian scenery.</p> 
<p>Its sandy beach, against which the tide beat in dalliance--the chafed spray catching and reflecting the glories of the setting sun--ran smoothly up a slope of some thirty yards; beyond which, the orange trees, in their greenest foliage, chequered with their shade the white cottages scattered above them.</p> 
<p>The busy hum of the fishermen on the coast--the splash of the casting net--and the drip of the oar--were appropriate accompaniments to the simple scene.</p> 
<p>On the Sicilian side, a different view wooed attention. There, old Etna upreared his encumbered head, around which the smoke clung in dense majesty; and--not contemptible rivals of the declining deity--the moon's silvery crescent, and the evening star's quiet splendour, were bedecking the cloudless blue of the firmament.</p> 
<p>Acme gazed enraptured on the scene--her long tresses hanging back on the chair, across which one hand was languidly thrown.</p> 
<p>"Giorgio," said she, "do you see this beautiful bird close to the ship--swimming so steadily--its snowy plumage apparently unwet from its contact with the wave? To what can you compare it?"</p> 
<p>"That bright-eyed gull, love!" replied he, "riding on the water as if all regardless that he is on the wide--wide sea--whose billows may so soon be lashed up to madness;--where may I find a resemblance more close, than my Acme's simplicity, which guides her through a troubled world, unknowing its treacheries, and happily ignorant of its dangers and its woes?"</p> 
<p>"Ah!" said the blushing girl, "how poetical you are this evening; will you tell us a story, Giorgio?"</p> 
<p>"I will tell you one," said Delme, interrupting her. "Do you recollect old Featherstone, who had been in the civil service in India, and who lived so near Delme Park, George?"</p> 
<p>"Perfectly," said his brother, "I remember I used to think him mad, because he always looked so melancholy, and used to send us word in the morning when he contemplated a visit; in order that all cats might be kept out of his way."</p> 
<p>"The very man! I am glad you know so much about him, for it is on this subject I was going to speak. I cannot tell you where he picked up the idea originally--but I believe in a dream--that a cat would occasion his death.</p> 
<p>"Well! he was at Ascot one year, when a gipsy woman came up to him on the course--told him his fortune--and, to his utter astonishment, warned him to beware of the wild cat.</p> 
<p>"From that moment, I understand his habits changed. From being a tolerably cheerful companion, he became a wretched hypochondriac; all his energies being directed to the avoiding a contact with any of the feline race.</p> 
<p>"Featherstone, two or three years ago, embarked in one of the mining speculations--lost great part of his fortune--and found it necessary to try and retrieve his affairs, by a second voyage to India.</p> 
<p>"I heard nothing more of him, till just before leaving England, when my old school-fellow, Lockhart, who went as a cadet to the East, called on me--reminded me of our old whimsical friend--and related his tragic death.</p> 
<p>"Lockhart says that one day he and some mutual friends, persuaded Featherstone to accompany them into the interior of the country, to enjoy the diversion of a boar hunt.</p> 
<p>"They had had good sport, and were returning homewards, when they suddenly came on a party of natives, headed by the Rajah.</p> 
<p>"They were mounted on elephants, and surrounding a jungle, in which, as some sepoys had reported, lay a tiger.</p> 
<p>"You know Lockhart's manner--animated and enthusiastic--making one see the scene he is describing.</p> 
<p>"I will try and clothe the rest of the story in his own words, although I can hardly hope it will make the same impression on you, that its recital did on me.</p> 
<p>"'Well, Sir! we all said we would see the sport--all but Featherstone--who said something about coming on.</p> 
<p>"'We were engaged to dine with Sir John M----, who was in that part of the world, on some six-and-eightpenny mission about indigo.</p> 
<p>"'The beaters went in, firing and shouting--intending to make him break towards the hunting party.</p> 
<p>"'We all drew up on one side, to be in view, but out of the way; Featherstone was next me. He suddenly grasped my arm, and pointed to the jungle, his teeth chattering--his face ashy pale. I turned and saw the tiger!--a splendid beast--certainly!</p> 
<p>"'He seemed not to notice us, and stalked on with an innocent yep! yep! like a sick hound's, more than anything else.</p> 
<p>"'Suddenly his eye caught us, and flashed fire. At the first view, he crouched to the earth, then came on us, bounding like a tost foot-ball. More magnificent leaps I never beheld! We were struck dumb--but fired--and turned our horses' heads!--all but Featherstone.</p> 
<p>"'I shall remember the tones of his voice to my dying hour.</p> 
<p>"'"The cat! Lockhart! the cat!"</p> 
<p>"'I don't know whether his horse refused the spur--or whether the rider's nerve was gone: but neither appeared to make an effort, till the animal was close on them.</p> 
<p>"'The horse gave one plunge--and had hardly recovered his feet, when down went horse and rider.</p> 
<p>"'Featherstone gave a piercing scream! Some of the sepoys were by this time up--and fired.</p> 
<p>"'The tiger trailed off--the blood spouting down his striped side.</p> 
<p>"'We came up--it was all over!</p> 
<p>"'The first stroke of that terrific paw had laid the unfortunate man's scull bare. On his shoulder, were the marks of the animal's teeth.</p> 
<p>"'The horse was still writhing in agony. One of my pistols relieved him.</p> 
<p>"'We bore Featherstone to the nearest cantonment, and buried him there.'"</p> 
<p>"How terrible!" said Acme, as she gave a slight shudder. "Englishmen are generally more sceptical on these points than we are; and disbelieve supernatural appearances, which we are accustomed to think are not unfrequent. I could tell you many stories, which, in my native island, were believed by our enemies the Turks, as well as by ourselves: but if you would like it, I will tell you a circumstance that occurred to myself, the reality of which I dare not doubt.</p> 
<p>"You have often, Giorgio! heard me revert with pain, to the horrible scene which took place, on the recapture of our little isle by the infidel Turks; when my family were massacred, and only poor Acme left to tell their tale."</p> 
<p>Here the young bride put her handkerchief to her face, and wept bitterly. George put his arm round her and soothed her. She continued her narrative.</p> 
<p>"You know my escape, and how I was sent to a kinsman, who had promised to have me sent to my kind friends in Malta. He was a Corfuote, and it was in Corfu I remained for a long--a very long time--and there first met my dear friend, Zoee Scalvo-Forressi. I was then very young. We lived in the Campagna--about four miles from each other.</p> 
<p>"We had both our Greek ponies, and used often to pass the evenings together; and at length knew our road so well, that often it was night before we parted.</p> 
<p>"One night, we had been singing together at her house, and it was later than usual when I cantered home.</p> 
<p>"About four months had elapsed previous to my landing in Corfu, and I had been eight months there; although at the time, I paid little attention to these circumstances.</p> 
<p>"My road lay through an olive grove. I had arrived in its centre, where a small knoll stretched away on my right; on whose summit, was a white Greek monastery, backed by some dark cypress trees.</p> 
<p>"The moon was shining brightly--dancing on the silver side of the olive trees--and illuminating the green sward.</p> 
<p>"This was smooth and verdant.</p> 
<p>"My spirits were more than usually buoyant, when suddenly my pony stopped.</p> 
<p>"I could not conceive the reason.</p> 
<p>"I looked before me. Immediately in front of me, was the shattered trunk of an old olive tree--it had been blasted by lightning--and sitting quietly at its foot--I saw my own mother, Giorgio! as clearly as I see you now. I could not be mistaken. She wore the same embroidered vest and Albanian shawl, as when I had last seen her.</p> 
<p>"She conversed with me calmly for many minutes, and--which surprised me much at the time--I felt no dread, and asked her and answered many questions.</p> 
<p>"She told me I should die early, in a foreign land; and many--many more things, which I dare not repeat; for I cannot contemplate the possibility of their being true.</p> 
<p>"At the time, I told you I felt composed: without any sense of alarm or surprise. For many days afterwards, however, I never left my bed of sickness.</p> 
<p>"I told my kinsman all the circumstances, and he discovered beyond a doubt, that it was on that very day, the twelve-month previous, that my poor mother had been murdered."</p> 
<p>Sir Henry and George tried to smile at Acme's story, and account for what she had seen;--but her manner was so impressive, and her ingenious reasonings--delivered in the most earnest tone--seemed to confute so entirely all their speculations, that they were at length content to deem it "wondrous strange."</p> 
<p>In the best and wisest of us, there is such a tendency to believe in a mysterious link, connecting the living and the departed; that a story of this nature, in exciting our feelings, serves to paralyse our reasoning faculties, and leaves us half converts, to the doctrines that we faintly combat.</p> 
<p>They looked forth again on the scene. The mountains of Calabria were frowning on them. The village was far behind--and not a straggling light marked its situation.</p> 
<p>Numberless stars were reflected on the glassy water, whose serenity was no longer ruffled by wing of sea bird, which long ere now had returned to its "wave girded nest."</p> 
<p>Our party and the watch were the only lingerers on deck.</p> 
<p>George wrapped Acme's silk cloak around her, and then carefully assisted her in her descent to the cabin.</p>
