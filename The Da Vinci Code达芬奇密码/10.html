Unfortunately, it was an expensive model equipped with a two-way radio feature, which, contrary to his orders, was now being used by one of his agents to page him.</p> 
<p>"Capitaine?" The phone crackled like a walkie-talkie.</p> 
<p>Fache felt his teeth clench in rage. He could imagine nothing important enough that Collet would interrupt this surveillance cachée—especially at this critical juncture.</p> 
<p>He gave Langdon a calm look of apology. "One moment please." He pulled the phone from his belt and pressed the radio transmission button. "Oui?"</p> 
<p>"Capitaine, un agent du Département de Cryptographie est arrivé."</p> 
<p>Fache's anger stalled momentarily. A cryptographer? Despite the lousy timing, this was probably good news. Fache, after finding Saunière's cryptic text on the floor, had uploaded photographs of the entire crime scene to the Cryptography Department in hopes someone there could tell him what the hell Saunière was trying to say. If a code breaker had now arrived, it most likely meant someone had decrypted Saunière's message.</p> 
<p>"I'm busy at the moment," Fache radioed back, leaving no doubt in his tone that a line had been crossed. "Ask the cryptographer to wait at the command post. I'll speak to him when I'm done."</p> 
<p>"Her," the voice corrected. "It's Agent Neveu."</p> 
<p>Fache was becoming less amused with this call every passing moment. Sophie Neveu was one of DCPJ's biggest mistakes. A young Parisian déchiffreuse who had studied cryptography in England at the Royal Holloway, Sophie Neveu had been foisted on Fache two years ago as part of the ministry's attempt to incorporate more women into the police force. The ministry's ongoing foray into political correctness, Fache argued, was weakening the department. Women not only lacked the physicality necessary for police work, but their mere presence posed a dangerous distraction to the men in the field. As Fache had feared, Sophie Neveu was proving far more distracting than most.</p> 
<p>At thirty-two years old, she had a dogged determination that bordered on obstinate. Her eager espousal of Britain's new cryptologic methodology continually exasperated the veteran French cryptographers above her. And by far the most troubling to Fache was the inescapable universal truth that in an office of middle-aged men, an attractive young woman always drew eyes away from the work at hand.</p> 
<p>The man on the radio said, "Agent Neveu insisted on speaking to you immediately, Captain. I tried to stop her, but she's on her way into the gallery."</p> 
<p>Fache recoiled in disbelief. "Unacceptable! I made it very clear—"</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>For a moment, Robert Langdon thought Bezu Fache was suffering a stroke. The captain was mid-sentence when his jaw stopped moving and his eyes bulged. His blistering gaze seemed fixated on something over Langdon's shoulder. Before Langdon could turn to see what it was, he heard a woman's voice chime out behind him.</p> 
<p>"Excusez-moi, messieurs."</p> 
<p>Langdon turned to see a young woman approaching. She was moving down the corridor toward them with long, fluid strides... a haunting certainty to her gait. Dressed casually in a knee-length, cream-colored Irish sweater over black leggings, she was attractive and looked to be about thirty. Her thick burgundy hair fell unstyled to her shoulders, framing the warmth of her face. Unlike the waifish, cookie-cutter blondes that adorned Harvard dorm room walls, this woman was healthy with an unembellished beauty and genuineness that radiated a striking personal confidence.</p> 
<p>To Langdon's surprise, the woman walked directly up to him and extended a polite hand. "Monsieur Langdon, I am Agent Neveu from DCPJ's Cryptology Department." Her words curved richly around her muted Anglo-Franco accent. "It is a pleasure to meet you."</p> 
<p>Langdon took her soft palm in his and felt himself momentarily fixed in her strong gaze. Her eyes were olive-green—incisive and clear.</p> 
<p>Fache drew a seething inhalation, clearly preparing to launch into a reprimand.</p> 
<p>"Captain," she said, turning quickly and beating him to the punch, "please excuse the interruption, but—"</p> 
<p>"Ce n'est pas le moment!" Fache sputtered.</p> 
<p>"I tried to phone you." Sophie continued in English, as if out of courtesy to Langdon. "But your cell phone was turned off."</p> 
<p>"I turned it off for a reason," Fache hissed. "I am speaking to Mr. Langdon."</p> 
<p>"I've deciphered the numeric code," she said flatly.</p> 
<p>Langdon felt a pulse of excitement. She broke the code?</p> 
<p>Fache looked uncertain how to respond.</p> 
<p>"Before I explain," Sophie said, "I have an urgent message for Mr. Langdon."</p> 
<p>Fache's expression turned to one of deepening concern. "For Mr. Langdon?"</p> 
<p>She nodded, turning back to Langdon. "You need to contact the U.S. Embassy, Mr. Langdon. They have a message for you from the States."</p> 
<p>Langdon reacted with surprise, his excitement over the code giving way to a sudden ripple of concern. A message from the States? He tried to imagine who could be trying to reach him. Only a few of his colleagues knew he was in Paris.</p> 
<p>Fache's broad jaw had tightened with the news. "The U.S. Embassy?" he demanded, sounding suspicious. "How would they know to find Mr. Langdon here?"</p> 
<p>Sophie shrugged. "Apparently they called Mr. Langdon's hotel, and the concierge told them Mr. Langdon had been collected by a DCPJ agent."</p> 
<p>Fache looked troubled. "And the embassy contacted DCPJ Cryptography?"</p> 
<p>"No, sir," Sophie said, her voice firm. "When I called the DCPJ switchboard in an attempt to contact you, they had a message waiting for Mr. Langdon and asked me to pass it along if I got through to you."</p> 
<p>Fache's brow furrowed in apparent confusion. He opened his mouth to speak, but Sophie had already turned back to Langdon.</p> 
<p>"Mr. Langdon," she declared, pulling a small slip of paper from her pocket, "this is the number for your embassy's messaging service. They asked that you phone in as soon as possible." She handed him the paper with an intent gaze. "While I explain the code to Captain Fache, you need to make this call."</p> 
<p>Langdon studied the slip. It had a Paris phone number and extension on it. "Thank you," he said, feeling worried now. "Where do I find a phone?"</p> 
<p>Sophie began to pull a cell phone from her sweater pocket, but Fache waved her off. He now looked like Mount Vesuvius about to erupt. Without taking his eyes off Sophie, he produced his own cell phone and held it out. "This line is secure, Mr. Langdon. You may use it."</p> 
<p>Langdon felt mystified by Fache's anger with the young woman. Feeling uneasy, he accepted the captain's phone. Fache immediately marched Sophie several steps away and began chastising her in hushed tones. Disliking the captain more and more, Langdon turned away from the odd confrontation and switched on the cell phone. Checking the slip of paper Sophie had given him, Langdon dialed the number.</p> 
<p>The line began to ring.</p> 
<p>One ring... two rings... three rings...</p> 
<p>Finally the call connected.</p> 
<p>Langdon expected to hear an embassy operator, but he found himself instead listening to an answering machine. Oddly, the voice on the tape was familiar. It was that of Sophie Neveu.</p> 
<p>"Bonjour, vous êtes bien chez Sophie Neveu," the woman's voice said. "Je suis absenle pour le moment, mais..."</p> 
<p>Confused, Langdon turned back toward Sophie. "I'm sorry, Ms. Neveu? I think you may have given me—"</p> 
<p>"No, that's the right number," Sophie interjected quickly, as if anticipating Langdon's confusion. "The embassy has an automated message system. You have to dial an access code to pick up your messages."</p> 
<p>Langdon stared. "But—"</p> 
<p>"It's the three-digit code on the paper I gave you."</p> 
<p>Langdon opened his mouth to explain the bizarre error, but Sophie flashed him a silencing glare that lasted only an instant. Her green eyes sent a crystal-clear message.</p> 
<p>Don't ask questions. Just do it.</p> 
<p>Bewildered, Langdon punched in the extension on the slip of paper: 454.</p> 
<p>Sophie's outgoing message immediately cut off, and Langdon heard an electronic voice announce in French: "You have one new message." Apparently, 454 was Sophie's remote access code for picking up her messages while away from home.</p> 
<p>I'm picking up this woman's messages?</p> 
<p>Langdon could hear the tape rewinding now. Finally, it stopped, and the machine engaged. Langdon listened as the message began to play. Again, the voice on the line was Sophie's.</p> 
<p>"Mr. Langdon," the message began in a fearful whisper. "Do not react to this message. Just listen calmly. You are in danger right now. Follow my directions very closely."</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>为了确保他和兰登先生的谈话不被打断，贝祖。法希已关掉了手机。不幸的是，这个昂贵的机型装备有双向无线电通讯功能，而他一个手下违反命令，正在使用这个功能呼他。</p> 
<p>"局长吗？"电话里传来像步话机那样的"噼噼啪啪"的声音。法希气得牙齿都要咬碎了。他不能想象出到底有什么重要的事情可以让科莱中断这个秘密监视--尤其是在这个关键时刻。</p> 
<p>他沉着而充满歉意地看了兰登一眼。"请稍等片刻。"他从腰带上拔出电话，摁下了无线传输键，用法语说："谁？"</p> 
<p>"局长，密码破译部的一位特工到了。"对方用法语说。</p> 
<p>法希把怒火暂时压了下去。一位密码破译人员？尽管来的不是什么时候，但这很可能是个好消息。法希发现了索尼埃写在地板上的神秘文字后，就把大堆的犯罪现场照片都送到了密码破译部，希望有人能告诉他索尼埃到底想说什么。如果是来了一位密码破译者，很可能是那个人已弄懂了索尼埃的意思。</p> 
<p>"我现在正忙着呢。"法希回话说，他的语气明白无误告诉对方，他在忙着应付另一部电话。"告诉密码破译者在指挥部等着。等我忙完了再和他说话。"</p> 
<p>"她。"对方纠正道。"是警察奈芙。"</p> 
<p>电话那头越说，法希越没兴致。接收索菲。奈芙是中央司法警察局最大的错误之一。奈芙是一个年轻的译电员，她是巴黎人，曾在英国皇家霍洛威大学学习过密码破译技术。两年前，部里尝试在警察队伍中多加入些女性，因此，索菲。奈芙被塞给了法希。部里要达到"政治上正确"的尝试还在进行之中，但法希争辩说这其实是弱化这个部门。女人不仅缺乏从事警察工作所需要的体力，而且她们的出现往往使这个行当的男人们心猿意马，这是很危险的。正如法希所担心的那样，事实证明，奈芙最不能让人省心。</p> 
<p>她三十二岁，意志坚定得几近固执。她太急于盲目相信英国的新方法，所以总是惹恼她上面那些老资格的法国密码破译人员。当然最令法希心烦的是那个放之四海而皆准的公理：在一群中年男人的办公室里，一位颇有魅力的年轻女郎总是把人们的眼球从手边的工作上吸走。</p> 
<p>无线通讯中的那个男人说："奈芙警官非要立刻和您谈话，局长。我尽最大的努力阻止她，但她现在已经朝画廊这边走来了。"法希心头一缩，简直不敢相信会是这样。"简直令人无法容忍，我已讲清楚--"</p> 
<p>罗伯特。兰登感觉法希好像在瞬间中了风。局长下颌突然不动了，眼球突出，只能说半截句子。他鼓起的水泡眼好像固定在兰登肩后的什么东西上。兰登还没来得及转身看是怎么回事，就听到一个女人的声音在他背后响起。</p> 
<p>"对不起，先生们。"她用法语说。兰登转过身，发现是一位年轻女郎，正迈着矫健的步伐大步流星地朝他们走来，随意穿着的齐膝的奶黄色爱尔兰毛衣，刚好到她黑皮靴的上方。她很有魅力，浓密的葡萄酒色的头发自然地飘落在肩头，却露出了面部的温和。与贴在哈佛大学宿舍墙上的那些弱不禁风的甜姐儿不同，这个女人有一种不加粉饰的健康美，浑身散发出惊人的自信。</p> 
<p>兰登没想到的是，那女人直接朝他走来并礼貌地伸出手来。"兰登先生，我是中央司法警察密码部的警察奈芙。"她说起话来抑扬顿挫，从她的英语中能听出法国口音。"很高兴见到您。"兰登握住她柔软的手掌，发现对方正使劲看着自己。她的眼睛是橄榄绿色的--锐利而清澈。法希使劲吸了一口气，显然是准备开始批评她。</p> 
<p>"局长。"她急忙转身，先发制人地说。"请原谅我打断了你们的谈话，但--"</p> 
<p>"现在不是时候！"法希气急败坏地用法语说。"我本想给你打电话。"好像是出于对兰登的礼貌，她还继续用英语说。"但是你电话关机了。"</p> 
<p>"我关机是有原因的。"他愤怒地朝她嘘了一声。"我在和兰登先生谈话。"</p> 
<p>"我已经破译了那个数字密码。"她干脆地说。</p> 
<p>从法希的表情看，他有点拿不准该对此做出何种反应。</p> 
<p>"在我解释之前。"索菲说。"我得先给兰登先生递个紧急的口信。"</p> 
<p>法希的表情显得越来越焦虑。"给兰登先生的口信？"</p> 
<p>她点点头，转回兰登。"您得和美国大使馆联系一下，兰登先生。他们有从美国来的留言给您。"兰登很吃惊，他刚才因密码引起的激动现在突然变成了一阵不安。来自美国的留言？</p> 
<p>他使劲想到底会是谁想找到他，只有很少几位同事知道他在巴黎。</p> 
<p>听到这个消息，法希也惊得嘴巴张得老大。"美国大使馆？"法希很怀疑地问了一声。"他们怎么知道到这儿来找兰登先生？"</p> 
<p>索菲耸耸肩。"显然，他们把电话打到兰登先生住的酒店，但接待员告诉他们兰登先生被一个中央司法警察给叫走了。"法希显得更不解了。"难道大使馆和中央司法警察密码部联系上了？"</p> 
<p>"不是，先生。"索菲语气坚定地说。"我在给中央司法警察局总机打电话联系您时，他们正好有一个口信要传给兰登先生。他们说如果我能接通您的电话，就让我把口信传给他。"法希眉头紧锁，一脸困惑。他想说话，但索菲已经转向兰登。</p> 
<p>她从衣袋里拿出一张小纸条大声说："兰登先生，这是你们大使馆提供的留言服务号码。他们要求你尽可能早地打进电话。"她把纸条递给他，又意味深长地看了他一眼。"在我向法希局长解释密码时，你得打电话。"兰登仔细看了纸条，上面有一个巴黎的电话号码和分机号。"谢谢。"他感到非常担忧。"我到哪里找电话呢？"</p> 
<p>索菲从毛衣口袋里取出手机，但法希示意她不要给他用。现在看起来他就像即将爆发的维苏威火山。他盯着索菲，拿出自己的手机递了过去。</p> 
<p>兰登对法希向索菲发火这事感到疑惑不解。他很紧张地接过局长的电话。法希立即把索菲推开几步远，开始低声严厉责备她。兰登越来越讨厌法希，他转身避开另两人之间令人不解的冲突，打开了手机。兰登核对了一下索菲给他的号码后，开始拨号。</p> 
<p>电话里传来了拨号声。</p> 
<p>一声……，两声……，三声……</p> 
<p>终于接通了。</p> 
<p>兰登原想自己会听到大使馆接线员的声音，没想到自己听到的却是一个语音信箱的录音。奇怪的是，录音带上的声音很熟悉，是索菲。奈芙的声音。</p> 
<p>"您好，这里是索菲。奈芙家。"一个女人用法语说道。"我现在不在家，但……"兰登被弄糊涂了，他转向索菲。"对不起，奈芙小姐，我想你可能给我--"</p> 
<p>"没错，就是那号码。"索菲迅速插话，好像已经预测到了兰登的困惑。"大使馆有自动留言服务系统，但您得先拨进入系统的号码，然后才能接收您的留言。"兰登怔住了。"但是--"</p> 
<p>"是我给您那张纸上的三位数号码。"</p> 
<p>兰登想开口解释这个滑稽的错误，索菲向他递了一个只持续片刻的、严厉的、让他沉默的眼色。她绿色的眼睛发出了一个非常明了的信息。</p> 
<p>别多问。按要求做。</p> 
<p>兰登疑惑不解地拨了纸上的分机号454.索菲的语音信箱里的话立刻中断了。兰登听到电脑录制的声音用法语说："你有一条新的留言。"显然，454 是索菲不在家时接听留言的远程进入密码。</p> 
<p>我要收听这个女人的留言？</p> 
<p>兰登能听到录音带倒带的声音。它终于停下来了，语音信箱也开始工作了。兰登听到机器开始播放的留言了。这次又是索菲的声音。</p> 
<p>"兰登先生。"留言里传出令人恐惧的低语声。"听到留言后，千万不要有什么反应，只管冷静地听。您现在处境危险，请严格遵守我的指令。"</p>
