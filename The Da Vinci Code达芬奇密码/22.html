<p>　　For an instant, standing in the exit stairwell, Sophie forgot all about trying to leave the Louvre.</p> 
<p>　　Her shock over the anagram was matched only by her embarrassment at not having deciphered themessage herself. Sophie's expertise in complex cryptanalysis had caused her to overlook simplisticword games, and yet she knew she should have seen it. After all, she was no stranger toanagrams—especially in English.</p> 
<p>　　When she was young, often her grandfather would use anagram games to hone her Englishspelling. Once he had written the English word "planets" and told Sophie that an astonishing sixty-two other English words of varying lengths could be formed using those same letters. Sophie hadspent three days with an English dictionary until she found them all.</p> 
<p>　　"I can't imagine," Langdon said, staring at the printout, "how your grandfather created such anintricate anagram in the minutes before he died."Sophie knew the explanation, and the realization made her feel even worse. I should have seen this!</p> 
<p>　　She now recalled that her grandfather—a wordplay aficionado and art lover—had entertainedhimself as a young man by creating anagrams of famous works of art. In fact, one of his anagramshad gotten him in trouble once when Sophie was a little girl. While being interviewed by anAmerican art magazine, Saunière had expressed his distaste for the modernist Cubist movement bynoting that Picasso's masterpiece Les Demoiselles d'Avignon was a perfect anagram of vilemeaningless doodles. Picasso fans were not amused.</p> 
<p>　　"My grandfather probably created this Mona Lisa anagram long ago," Sophie said, glancing up atLangdon. And tonight he was forced to use it as a makeshift code. Her grandfather's voice hadcalled out from beyond with chilling precision.</p> 
<p>　　Leonardo da Vinci!</p> 
<p>　　The Mona Lisa!</p> 
<p>　　Why his final words to her referenced the famous painting, Sophie had no idea, but she could thinkof only one possibility. A disturbing one.</p> 
<p>　　Those were not his final words....</p> 
<p>　　Was she supposed to visit the Mona Lisa? Had her grandfather left her a message there? The ideaseemed perfectly plausible. After all, the famous painting hung in the Salle des Etats—a privateviewing chamber accessible only from the Grand Gallery. In fact, Sophie now realized, the doorsthat opened into the chamber were situated only twenty meters from where her grandfather hadbeen found dead.</p> 
<p>　　He easily could have visited the Mona Lisa before he died.</p> 
<p>　　Sophie gazed back up the emergency stairwell and felt torn. She knew she should usher Langdonfrom the museum immediately, and yet instinct urged her to the contrary. As Sophie recalled herfirst childhood visit to the Denon Wing, she realized that if her grandfather had a secret to tell her,few places on earth made a more apt rendezvous than Da Vinci's Mona Lisa.</p> 
<p>　　"She's just a little bit farther," her grandfather had whispered, clutching Sophie's tiny hand as he ledher through the deserted museum after hours.</p> 
<p>　　Sophie was six years old. She felt small and insignificant as she gazed up at the enormous ceilingsand down at the dizzying floor. The empty museum frightened her, although she was not about tolet her grandfather know that. She set her jaw firmly and let go of his hand.</p> 
<p>　　"Up ahead is the Salle des Etats," her grandfather said as they approached the Louvre's mostfamous room. Despite her grandfather's obvious excitement, Sophie wanted to go home. She hadseen pictures of the Mona Lisa in books and didn't like it at all. She couldn't understand whyeveryone made such a fuss.</p> 
<p>　　"C'est ennuyeux," Sophie grumbled.</p> 
<p>　　"Boring," he corrected. "French at school. English at home.""Le Louvre, c'est pas chez moi!" she challenged.</p> 
<p>　　He gave her a tired laugh. "Right you are. Then let's speak English just for fun."Sophie pouted and kept walking. As they entered the Salle des Etats, her eyes scanned the narrowroom and settled on the obvious spot of honor—the center of the right-hand wall, where a loneportrait hung behind a protective Plexiglas wall. Her grandfather paused in the doorway andmotioned toward the painting.</p> 
<p>　　"Go ahead, Sophie. Not many people get a chance to visit her alone."Swallowing her apprehension, Sophie moved slowly across the room. After everything she'd heardabout the Mona Lisa, she felt as if she were approaching royalty. Arriving in front of the protectivePlexiglas, Sophie held her breath and looked up, taking it in all at once.</p> 
<p>　　Sophie was not sure what she had expected to feel, but it most certainly was not this. No jolt ofamazement. No instant of wonder. The famous face looked as it did in books. She stood in silencefor what felt like forever, waiting for something to happen.</p> 
<p>　　"So what do you think?" her grandfather whispered, arriving behind her. "Beautiful, yes?""She's too little."Saunière smiled. "You're little and you're beautiful."I am not beautiful, she thought. Sophie hated her red hair and freckles, and she was bigger than allthe boys in her class. She looked back at the Mona Lisa and shook her head. "She's even worsethan in the books. Her face is... brumeux.""Foggy," her grandfather tutored.</p> 
<p>　　"Foggy," Sophie repeated, knowing the conversation would not continue until she repeated her newvocabulary word.</p> 
<p>　　"That's called the sfumato style of painting," he told her, "and it's very hard to do. Leonardo daVinci was better at it than anyone."Sophie still didn't like the painting. "She looks like she knows something... like when kids at schoolhave a secret."Her grandfather laughed. "That's part of why she is so famous. People like to guess why she issmiling.""Do you know why she's smiling?""Maybe." Her grandfather winked. "Someday I'll tell you all about it."Sophie stamped her foot. "I told you I don't like secrets!""Princess," he smiled. "Life is filled with secrets. You can't learn them all at once.""I'm going back up," Sophie declared, her voice hollow in the stairwell.</p> 
<p>　　"To the Mona Lisa?" Langdon recoiled. "Now?"Sophie considered the risk. "I'm not a murder suspect. I'll take my chances. I need to understandwhat my grandfather was trying to tell me.""What about the embassy?"Sophie felt guilty turning Langdon into a fugitive only to abandon him, but she saw no otheroption. She pointed down the stairs to a metal door. "Go through that door, and follow theilluminated exit signs. My grandfather used to bring me down here. The signs will lead you to asecurity turnstile. It's monodirectional and opens out." She handed Langdon her car keys. "Mine isthe red SmartCar in the employee lot. Directly outside this bulkhead. Do you know how to get tothe embassy?"Langdon nodded, eyeing the keys in his hand.</p> 
<p>　　"Listen," Sophie said, her voice softening. "I think my grandfather may have left me a message atthe Mona Lisa—some kind of clue as to who killed him. Or why I'm in danger." Or what happenedto my family. "I have to go see.""But if he wanted to tell you why you were in danger, why wouldn't he simply write it on the floorwhere he died? Why this complicated word game?""Whatever my grandfather was trying to tell me, I don't think he wanted anyone else to hear it. Noteven the police." Clearly, her grandfather had done everything in his power to send a confidentialtransmission directly to her. He had written it in code, included her secret initials, and told her tofind Robert Langdon—a wise command, considering the American symbologist had deciphered hiscode. "As strange as it may sound," Sophie said, "I think he wants me to get to the Mona Lisabefore anyone else does.""I'll come.""No! We don't know how long the Grand Gallery will stay empty. You have to go."Langdon seemed hesitant, as if his own academic curiosity were threatening to override soundjudgment and drag him back into Fache's hands.</p> 
<p>　　"Go. Now." Sophie gave him a grateful smile. "I'll see you at the embassy, Mr. Langdon."Langdon looked displeased. "I'll meet you there on one condition," he replied, his voice stern.</p> 
<p>　　She paused, startled. "What's that?""That you stop calling me Mr. Langdon."Sophie detected the faint hint of a lopsided grin growing across Langdon's face, and she felt herselfsmile back. "Good luck, Robert."When Langdon reached the landing at the bottom of the stairs, the unmistakable smell of linseedoil and plaster dust assaulted his nostrils. Ahead, an illuminated SORTIE/EXIT displayed an arrowpointing down a long corridor.</p> 
<p>　　Langdon stepped into the hallway.</p> 
<p>　　To the right gaped a murky restoration studio out of which peered an army of statues in variousstates of repair. To the left, Langdon saw a suite of studios that resembled Harvard artclassrooms—rows of easels, paintings, palettes, framing tools—an art assembly line.</p> 
<p>　　As he moved down the hallway, Langdon wondered if at any moment he might awake with a startin his bed in Cambridge. The entire evening had felt like a bizarre dream. I'm about to dash out ofthe Louvre... a fugitive.</p> 
<p>　　Saunière's clever anagrammatic message was still on his mind, and Langdon wondered whatSophie would find at the Mona Lisa... if anything. She had seemed certain her grandfather meantfor her to visit the famous painting one more time. As plausible an interpretation as this seemed,Langdon felt haunted now by a troubling paradox.</p> 
<p>　　P.S. Find Robert Langdon.</p> 
<p>　　Saunière had written Langdon's name on the floor, commanding Sophie to find him. But why?</p> 
<p>　　Merely so Langdon could help her break an anagram?</p> 
<p>　　It seemed quite unlikely.</p> 
<p>　　After all, Saunière had no reason to think Langdon was especially skilled at anagrams. We've nevereven met. More important, Sophie had stated flat out that she should have broken the anagram onher own. It had been Sophie who spotted the Fibonacci sequence, and, no doubt, Sophie who, ifgiven a little more time, would have deciphered the message with no help from Langdon.</p> 
<p>　　Sophie was supposed to break that anagram on her own. Langdon was suddenly feeling morecertain about this, and yet the conclusion left an obvious gaping lapse in the logic of Saunière'sactions.</p> 
<p>　　Why me? Langdon wondered, heading down the hall. Why was Saunière's dying wish that hisestranged granddaughter find me? What is it that Saunière thinks I know?</p> 
<p>　　With an unexpected jolt, Langdon stopped short. Eyes wide, he dug in his pocket and yanked outthe computer printout. He stared at the last line of Saunière's message.</p> 
<p>　　P.S. Find Robert Langdon.</p> 
<p>　　He fixated on two letters.</p> 
<p>　　P.S.</p> 
<p>　　In that instant, Langdon felt Saunière's puzzling mix of symbolism fall into stark focus. Like a pealof thunder, a career's worth of symbology and history came crashing down around him. EverythingJacques Saunière had done tonight suddenly made perfect sense.</p> 
<p>　　Langdon's thoughts raced as he tried to assemble the implications of what this all meant. Wheeling,he stared back in the direction from which he had come.</p> 
<p>　　Is there time?</p> 
<p>　　He knew it didn't matter.</p> 
<p>　　Without hesitation, Langdon broke into a sprint back toward the stairs.</p> 
<p>《蒙娜丽莎》。</p> 
<p>半晌，索菲愣在楼梯上，完全忘记了要逃出卢浮宫的事儿。</p> 
<p>她对这个字谜感到极为震惊，同时也为自己没有能够亲自破解信息感到万分尴尬。索菲精通复杂的密码分析，而这却让她忽略了那些简单的文字游戏，其实她知道她早就该破解出这则信息的。毕竟，她对字谜并不陌生，特别是英文字谜。</p> 
<p>索菲小时候，祖父经常用字谜游戏来锻炼她的英文拼写能力。有一次，他写下了英文单词"planets"，并告诉索菲排列重组这几个字母就可以得到六十二个不同长度的英文单词。索菲花了三天时间查英文词典，将这些单词全部找了出来。</p> 
<p>"真难以想象。"兰登盯着打印稿说道。"你祖父在死前的几分钟内竟能想出这么复杂的字谜。"索菲知道这其中原由，但这使她更加不好受。我早该想到了！现在，她回忆起来，祖父既是个文字游戏迷又是个艺术爱好者，他年轻时常通过创作有关艺术名作的字谜自娱自乐。索菲小时候，祖父还曾因为他所创作的一个字谜遇上了麻烦。在接受一家美国艺术杂志采访的时候，索尼埃提出毕加索的名画《亚威农少女》（LesDemoisellesd’Avignon）</p> 
<p>做成字谜游戏正好可以得出"讨厌而无意义的蠢人"（vilemeaninglessdoodles），表明他对"现代立体派运动"并不欣赏。此举引起了毕加索迷的不满。</p> 
<p>"祖父可能早就想好这个‘蒙娜丽莎’的字谜了。"索菲看着兰登，说道。今晚他迫不得已用它作为密码。祖父的声音从天际传来，清晰得让人不寒而栗。</p> 
<p>列昂纳多。达。芬奇！</p> 
<p>《蒙娜丽莎》！</p> 
<p>索菲不知道为什么祖父在最后的遗言中要提到那幅名画，但她可以想到一种可能--一种让人不安的可能。</p> 
<p>那不是祖父的最后遗言……</p> 
<p>祖父是不是想让她去看一看《蒙娜丽莎》？索菲现在才意识到，通往那间展厅的门距祖父的尸体只有二十米远。</p> 
<p>他完全可能在死前去过名画《蒙娜丽莎》那里。</p> 
<p>索菲扭头望了一眼紧急楼梯通道，感到非常为难。她知道她应该立即将兰登带出博物馆，但她的本能却阻止她这样做。索菲意识到，要是祖父有秘密要告诉她，没有什么比达。芬奇的《蒙娜丽莎》那里更合适的地方了。</p> 
<p>"再走一点儿就到了。"祖父搀着索菲稚嫩的小手，在空荡荡的博物馆中已经穿行了几个小时。</p> 
<p>那时索菲只有六岁。她仰望巨大的屋顶，俯视眩目的地板，觉得自己很渺小。空旷的博物馆使她感到害怕，但她不想让祖父看出来。她咬紧牙关，放开了祖父的手。</p> 
<p>他们走近卢浮宫最著名的那间展厅，祖父说："前面就是国家展厅。"虽然此时祖父变得非常兴奋，但索菲却只想回家。她已经在书中看过了《蒙娜丽莎》，但一点儿也不喜欢那幅画。她不明白为什么所有人都那么喜爱这幅画。</p> 
<p>"无聊。"索菲用法语低声嘀咕着。</p> 
<p>"无聊。"祖父用英语纠正道。"在校说法语，在家说英语。"</p> 
<p>"这里是卢浮宫，不是家。"索菲用法语反驳道。</p> 
<p>祖父无奈地笑了笑，说："你说得对。那么我们就说英语玩。"</p> 
<p>索菲噘着嘴，继续往前走。来到国家展厅后，索菲扫视了一下这个狭窄的房间，目光停留在了展览馆引以为骄傲的地方--右边墙的中间，防护玻璃之后悬挂着的那幅肖像画。祖父在门口停住了脚步，转身面向那幅画。</p> 
<p>"往前走，索菲。很少人有机会单独参观这幅画。"</p> 
<p>索菲压抑着心中的不安，慢慢地走进房间。由于听说过种种关于《蒙娜丽莎》的事，她觉得自己仿佛在走近一样无比神圣的东西。她来到防护玻璃前，屏住呼吸，抬头望去，一下子就喜欢上了这幅画。</p> 
<p>索菲忘了自己预期的感觉是怎样的，但她肯定那与她的实际感觉不同。她没有丝毫惊奇和赞叹，因为那张大名远扬的脸庞看上去就和书中的一模一样。不知过了多久，她一直默默地站在那里，等待着什么将要发生的事。</p> 
<p>"怎么样？"祖父来到她身后，轻声说道："很美，对吗？"</p> 
<p>"她太小了。"</p> 
<p>索尼埃微笑着说："你很小，但你很美丽。"</p> 
<p>我不美丽，索菲想。索菲讨厌自己的红发和雀斑，她还比班上的所有男孩儿都高大。</p> 
<p>索菲回头看看《蒙娜丽莎》，摇了摇头。"她比书上的还糟。她的脸上……"索菲顿了顿，用法语接着说。"好像有一层雾。"</p> 
<p>"雾蒙蒙的。"祖父把这个新英文单词教给她。</p> 
<p>"雾蒙蒙的。"索菲跟读道。她知道只有她把这个新单词再读一遍，祖父才会继续说下去。</p> 
<p>"那是晕染法。"祖父告诉索菲。"那是一种很难掌握的手法。达。芬奇运用得最好。"</p> 
<p>索菲还是不喜欢那幅画。"她好像知道些什么……就像学校里的小朋友知道一个秘密那样。"祖父大笑起来。"这就是她如此著名的原因之一。人们喜欢猜她为什么而微笑。"</p> 
<p>"您知道她为什么而微笑吗？"</p> 
<p>"也许吧。"祖父挤了挤眼睛说。"有一天我会告诉你。"</p> 
<p>索菲跺着脚说："我说过我不喜欢秘密！"</p> 
<p>"公主。"祖父微笑着说。"生活中充满了秘密。你不能一下把它们全部解开。"</p> 
<p>"我要回到上面去。"索菲大声宣布，她的声音在楼梯通道中回响。</p> 
<p>"到《蒙娜丽莎》那里？"兰登反问道。"现在吗？"</p> 
<p>索菲掂量着此举的危险性。"我不是谋杀案的嫌疑人，我要抓住机会。我要知道祖父想告诉我的事。""那么还去大使馆吗？"</p> 
<p>把兰登变成了逃犯，又把他抛下，索菲为此感到内疚，但她别无选择。她指着楼梯下方的一扇金属门，说道："穿过那扇门，然后看那些亮着的出口指向牌。祖父过去就是从这里把我带下去。按照指向牌的提示，你会发现装着一个旋转栅门的安全出口。它单向旋转，通向宫外。"说着，她把车钥匙递给兰登。"我的车是一辆红色的‘都会精灵’，停在公务停车区。就在这堵墙的外面。你知道去大使馆的路吗？"</p> 
<p>兰登看着手中的钥匙，点了点头。</p> 
<p>"听我说。"索菲柔声说。"我想祖父在《蒙娜丽莎》那里给我留下了信息--关于杀人凶手的信息，或是能解释为什么我处境危险的信息，或是关于我家庭的信息。我必须去看看。""但如果他想告诉你为什么你处境危险，为何不直接写在地板上？为什么要做复杂的文字游戏？"</p> 
<p>"无论祖父想告诉我些什么，他都不会愿意让旁人知道，甚至包括警察。"显然，祖父是想抓住主动权，把机密直接传达给她。他将对索菲的秘密称呼的首字母写在密码中，并让她去找兰登。从这位美国象征学专家已经破译了密码的事实来看，这确实是个明智之举。</p> 
<p>"听起来奇怪。"索菲说。"我认为他想让我赶在别人之前去看一看《蒙娜丽莎》。"</p> 
<p>"我也去。"</p> 
<p>"不！我们不知道什么时候会来人。你必须走。"</p> 
<p>兰登犹豫不决，似乎他对学术问题的好奇心有可能战胜理智的判断，把他拖回到法希的手中。</p> 
<p>"赶快走。"索菲的微笑中充满了感激之情。"兰登先生，使馆见。"</p> 
<p>兰登看上去有点儿不高兴。他严肃地答道："只有在一种条件下，我才会见你。"</p> 
<p>索菲愣了一下，吃惊地问："什么条件？"</p> 
<p>"除非你不再叫我兰登先生。"</p> 
<p>索菲觉察出兰登的笑有点儿不自然，自己也笑不出来了。"祝你好运，罗伯特。"</p> 
<p>兰登走下了楼梯，一股亚麻油和石膏的气味扑鼻而来。前方，有一块亮着的出口指向牌，牌上的箭头指向一条长长的走廊。</p> 
<p>兰登走在长廊中，怀疑他是否会随时从这场梦中醒来，发现自己还躺在剑桥大学里的床上。整个夜晚就像一场奇异的梦。"我将飞快地跑出卢浮宫……作为一名逃犯。"</p> 
<p>索尼埃那设计巧妙的信息还留在他的脑海中，他想知道索菲是否会在《蒙娜丽莎》那里发现些什么。显然，她坚信祖父要让她再去看一次《蒙娜丽莎》。虽然她的想法看上去很合理，但兰登却为一个与此相反的想法困扰着。</p> 
<p>公主：去找罗伯特。兰登。（P.S.FindRobertLangdon.）</p> 
<p>索尼埃在地板上写下兰登的名字，让索菲去找他。为什么呢？难道仅仅是为了让他帮助索菲破解一个字谜？</p> 
<p>好像并非如此。毕竟，索尼埃不会认为兰登擅长字谜游戏。我们素未谋面。更重要的是，索菲曾坦言她自己应该可以解开那个字谜。是索菲认出了斐波那契数列，毫无疑问，如果再花一点儿时间，她可以独立地破解密码。</p> 
<p>索菲本应独立地破解密码。兰登忽然更加确信这一点，但这样的结论与索尼埃的行为逻辑似乎不太吻合。</p> 
<p>为什么要找我呢？兰登边走边思量着。为什么索尼埃的遗愿是让与他失和的孙女来找我？他认为我会知道些什么？</p> 
<p>兰登忽然一惊，停下了脚步。他把手伸进口袋，猛地掏出那张电脑打印稿，瞪大眼睛盯着那最后一行信息：公主：去找罗伯特。兰登。（P.S.FindRobertLangdon.）</p> 
<p>他的目光停在两个字母上：P.S.</p> 
<p>那一刻，兰登感到索尼埃留下的所有令人费解的象征符号有了明确的意义。象征学和历史研究的意义顷刻间呈现出来。雅克。索尼埃的所作所为得到了完全合理的解释。</p> 
<p>兰登在脑海中快速地将所有符号的象征含义联系在一起。他转过身，看着来时的方向。</p> 
<p>还有时间吗？</p> 
<p>他知道这并不重要。他毫不犹豫地冲着楼梯跑了回去。</p>
