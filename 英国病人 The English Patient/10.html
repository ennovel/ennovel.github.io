Some celery on the table, someturnips whose roots were still muddy. The only light came from a fire Hana had recently started. She had herback to him and had not heard his steps into the room. His days at the villa had loosened his body and freed histenseness, so he seemed big.ger, more sprawled out in his gestures. Only his silence of movement remained.
<br> 
<br> Otherwise there was an easy inefficiency to him now, a sleepiness to his gestures.
<br> 
<br> He dragged out the chair so she would turn, realize he was in the room.
<br> 
<br> “Hello, David.”
<br> 
<br> He raised his arm. He felt that he had been in deserts for too long.
<br> 
<br> “How is he?”
<br> 
<br> “Asleep. Talked himself out.”
<br> 
<br> “Is he what you thought he was?”
<br> 
<br> “He’s fine. We can let him be.”
<br> 
<br> “I thought so. Kip and I are both sure he is English. Kip thinks the best people are eccentrics, he worked withone.”
<br> 
<br> “I think Kip is the eccentric myself. Where is he, anyway?”
<br> 
<br> “He’s plotting something on the terrace, doesn’t want me out there. Something for my birthday.” Hana stood upfrom her crouch at the grate, wiping her hand on the opposite forearm.
<br> 
<br> “For your birthday I’m going to tell you a small story,” he said.
<br> 
<br> She looked at him.
<br> 
<br> “Not about Patrick, okay?”
<br> 
<br> “A little about Patrick, mostly about you.”
<br> 
<br> “I still can’t listen to those stories, David.”
<br> 
<br> “Fathers die. You keep on loving them in any way you can. You can’t hide him away in your heart.”
<br> 
<br> “Talk to me when the morphia wears off.”
<br> 
<br> She came up to him and put her arms around him, reached up and kissed his cheek. His embrace tightenedaround her, his stubble like sand against her skin. She loved that about him now; in the past he had always beenmeticulous. The parting in his hair like Yonge Street at midnight, Patrick had said. Caravaggio had in the pastmoved like a god in her pres.ence. Now, with his face and his trunk filled out and this greyness in him, he was afriendlier human.
<br> 
<br> Tonight dinner was being prepared by the sapper. Caravag.gio was not looking forward to it. One meal in threewas a loss as far as he was concerned. Kip found vegetables and pre.sented them barely cooked, just brieflyboiled into a soup. It was to be another purist meal, not what Caravaggio wished for after a day such as this whenhe had been listening to the man upstairs. He opened the cupboard beneath the sink. There, wrapped in dampcloth, was some dried meat, which Caravag.gio cut and put into his pocket.
<br> 
<br> “I can get you off the morphine, you know. I’m a good nurse.”
<br> 
<br> “You’re surrounded by madmen...”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, I think we are all mad.”
<br> 
<br> When Kip called them, they walked out of the kitchen and onto the terrace, whose border, with its low stonebalustrade, was ringed with light.
<br> 
<br> It looked to Caravaggio like a string of small electric candles found in dusty churches, and he thought the sapperhad gone too far in removing them from a chapel, even for Hana’s birth.day. Hana walked slowly forward withher hands over her face. There was no wind. Her legs and thighs moved through the skirt of her frock as if itwere thin water. Her tennis shoes silent on the stone.
<br> 
<br> “I kept finding dead shells wherever I was digging,” the sapper said.
<br> 
<br> They still didn’t understand. Caravaggio bent over the flut.ter of lights. They were snail shells filled with oil. Helooked along the row of them; there must have been about forty.
<br> 
<br> “Forty-five,” Kip said, “the years so far of this century. Where I come from, we celebrate the age as well asourselves.”
<br> 
<br> Hana moved alongside them, her hands in her pockets now, the way Kip loved to see her walk. So relaxed, as ifshe had put her arms away for the night, now in simple armless movement.
<br> 
<br> Caravaggio was diverted by the startling presence of three bottles of red wine on the table. He walked over andread the labels and shook his head, amazed. He knew the sapper wouldn’t drink any of it. All three had alreadybeen opened. Kip must have picked his way through some etiquette book in the library. Then he saw the cornand the meat and the pota.toes. Hana slid her arm into Kip’s and came with him to the table.
<br> 
<br> They ate and drank, the unexpected thickness of the wine like meat on their tongues. They were soon turningsilly in their toasts to the sapper—”the great forager”—and to the English patient. They toasted each other, Kipjoining in with his beaker of water. This was when he began to talk about himself. Caravaggio pressing him on,not always listening, sometimes standing up and walking around the table, pacing and pacing with pleasure at allthis. He wanted these two married, longed to force them verbally towards it, but they seemed to have their ownstrange rules about their relation.ship. What was he doing in this role. He sat down again. Now and then henoticed the death of a light. The snail shells held only so much oil. Kip would rise and refill them with pinkparaffin.
<br> 
<br> “We must keep them lit till midnight.”
<br> 
<br> They talked then about the war, so far away. “When the war with Japan is over, everyone will finally go home,”
<br> 
<br> Kip said. “And where will you go?” Caravaggio asked. The sapper rolled his head, half nodding, half shaking it,his mouth smil.ing. So Caravaggio began to talk, mostly to Kip.
<br> 
<br> The dog cautiously approached the table and laid its head on Caravaggio’s lap. The sapper asked for other storiesabout Toronto as if it were a place of peculiar wonders. Snow that drowned the city, iced up the harbour,ferryboats in the sum.mer where people listened to concerts. But what he was really interested in were the cluesto Hana’s nature, though she was evasive, veering Caravaggio away from stories that involved some moment ofher life. She wanted Kip to know her only in the present, a person perhaps more flawed or more compas.sionateor harder or more obsessed than the girl or young woman she had been then. In her life there was her motherAlice her father Patrick her stepmother Clara and Caravaggio. She had already admitted these names to Kip as ifthey were her credentials, her dowry. They were faultless and needed no discussion. She used them likeauthorities in a book she could refer to on the right way to boil an egg, or the correct way to slip garlic into alamb. They were not to be questioned.
<br> 
<br> And now—because he was quite drunk—Caravaggio told the story of Hana’s singing the “Marseillaise,” whichhe had told her before. “Yes, I have heard the song,” said Kip, and he attempted a version of it. “No, you have tosing it out,” said Hana, “you have to sing it standing up!”
<br> 
<br> She stood up, pulled her tennis shoes off and climbed onto the table. There were four snail lights flickering,almost dying, on the table beside her bare feet.
<br> 
<br> “This is for you. This is how you must learn to sing it, Kip. This is for you.”
<br> 
<br> She sang up into darkness beyond their snail light, beyond the square of light from the English patient’s roomand into the dark sky waving with shadows of cypress. Her hands came out of their pockets.
<br> 
<br> Kip had heard the song in the camps, sung by groups of men, often during strange moments, such as before anim.promptu soccer match. And Caravaggio when he had heard it in the last few years of the war never reallyliked it, never liked to listen to it. In his heart he had Hana’s version from many years before. Now he listenedwith a pleasure because she was singing again, but this was quickly altered by the way she sang. Not the passionof her at sixteen but echoing the tentative circle of light around her in the darkness. She was singing it as if it wassomething scarred, as if one couldn’t ever again bring all the hope of the song together. It had been altered by thefive years leading to this night of her twenty-first birthday in the forty-fifth year of the twentieth century. Singingin the voice of a tired traveller, alone against every.thing. A new testament. There was no certainty to the songanymore, the singer could only be one voice against all the mountains of power. That was the only sureness. Theone voice was the single unspoiled thing. A song of snail light. Caravaggio realized she was singing with andechoing the heart of the sapper.
<br> 
<br> In the tent there have been nights of no talk and nights full of talk. They are never sure what will occur, whosefraction of past will emerge, or whether touch will be anonymous and silent in their darkness. The intimacy ofher body or the body of her language in his ear—as they lie upon the air pillow he insists on blowing up andusing each night. He has been charmed by this Western invention. He dutifully releases the air and folds it intothree each morning, as he has done all the way up the landmass of Italy.
<br> 
<br> In the tent Kip nestles against her neck. He dissolves to her scratching fingernails across his skin. Or he has hismouth against her mouth, his stomach against her wrist.
<br> 
<br> She sings and hums. She thinks him, in this tent’s dark.ness, to be half bird—a quality of feather within him, thecold iron at his wrist. He moves sleepily whenever he is in such darkness with her, not quite quick as the world,whereas in daylight he glides through all that is random around him, the way colour glides against colour.
<br> 
<br> But at night he embraces torpor. She cannot see his order and discipline without seeing his eyes. There isn’t akey to him. Everywhere she touches braille doorways. As if organs, the heart, the rows of rib, can be seen underthe skin, saliva across her hand now a colour. He has mapped her sadness more than any other. Just as she knowsthe strange path of love he has for his dangerous brother. “To be a wanderer is in our blood. That is why jailing ismost difficult for his nature and he would kill himself to get free.”
<br> 
<br> During the verbal nights, they travel his country of five rivers. The Sutlej, Jhelum, Ravi, Chenab, Beas. Heguides her into the great gurdwara, removing her shoes, watching as she washes her feet, covers her head. Whatthey enter was built in 1601, desecrated in 1757 and built again immediately. In 1830 gold and marble wereapplied. “If I took you before morning you would see first of all the mist over the water. Then it lifts to reveal thetemple in light. You will already be hearing the hymns of the saints—Ramananda, Nanak and Kabir. Singing isat the centre of worship. You hear the song, you smell the fruit from the temple gardens—pomegranates,oranges. The temple is a haven in the flux of life, accessible to all. It is the ship that crossed the ocean ofignorance.”
<br> 
<br> They move through the night, they move through the silver door to the shrine where the Holy Book lies under acanopy of brocades. The ragis sing the Book’s verses accompanied by musicians. They sing from four in themorning till eleven at night. The Granth Sahib is opened at random, a quotation selected, and for three hours,before the mist lifts off the lake to reveal the Golden Temple, the verses mingle and sway out with unbrokenreading.
<br> 
<br> Kip walks her beside a pool to the tree shrine where Baba Gujhaji, the first priest of the temple, is buried. A treeof superstitions, four hundred and fifty years old. “My mother came here to tie a string onto a branch andbeseeched the tree for a son, and when my brother was born returned and asked to be blessed with another. Thereare sacred trees and magic water all over the Punjab.”
<br> 
<br> Hana is quiet. He knows the depth of darkness in her, her lack of a child and of faith. He is always coaxing herfrom the edge of her fields of sadness. A child lost. A father lost.
<br> 
<br> “I have lost someone like a father as well,” he has said. But she knows this man beside her is one of the charmed,who has grown up an outsider and so can switch allegiances, can replace loss. There are those destroyed byunfairness and those who are not. If she asks him he will say he has had a good life —his brother in jail, hiscomrades blown up, and he risking himself daily in this war.
<br> 
<br> In spite of the kindnesses in such people they were a terrible unfairness. He could be all day in a clay pitdismantling a bomb that might kill him at any moment, could come home from the burial of a fellow sapper, hisenergy saddened, but whatever the trials around him there was always solution and light. But she saw none. Forhim there were the various maps of fate, and at Amritsar’s temple all faiths and classes were welcome and atetogether. She herself would be allowed to place money or a flower onto the sheet spread upon the floor and thenjoin in the great permanent singing.
<br> 
<br> She wished for that. Her inwardness was a sadness of na.ture. He himself would allow her to enter any of histhirteen gates of character, but she knew that if he were in danger he would never turn to face her. He wouldcreate a space around himself and concentrate. This was his craft. Sikhs, he said, were brilliant at technology.
<br> 
<br> “We have a mystical closeness... what is it?” “Affinity.” “Yes, affinity, with machines.”
<br> 
<br> He would be lost among them for hours, the beat of music within the crystal set whacking away at his foreheadand into his hair. She did not believe she could turn fully to him and be his lover. He moved at a speed thatallowed him to replace loss. That was his nature. She would not judge it in him. What right did she have. Kipstepping out each morning with his satchel hanging off his left shoulder and walking the path away from theVilla San Girolamo. Each morning she watched him, seeing his freshness towards the world perhaps for the lasttime. After a few minutes he would look up into the shrapnel-torn cypresses, whose middle branches had beenshelled away. Pliny must have walked down a path like this, or Stendahl, because passages in The Charterhouseof Parma had occurred in this part of the world too.
<br> 
<br> Kip would look up, the arch of the high wounded trees over him, the path in front of him mediaeval, and he ayoung man of the strangest profession his century had invented, a sapper, a military engineer who detected anddisarmed mines. Each morning he emerged from the tent, bathed and dressed in the garden, and stepped awayfrom the villa and its surroundings, not even entering the house—maybe a wave if he saw her— as if language,humanity, would confuse him, get, like blood, into the machine he had to understand. She would see him fortyyards from the house, in a clearing of the path.
<br> 
<br> It was the moment he left them all behind. The moment the drawbridge closed behind the knight and he wasalone with just the peacefulness of his own strict talent. In Siena there was that mural she had seen. A fresco of acity. A few yards outside the city walls the artist’s paint had crumbled away, so there was not even the securityof art to provide an orchard in the far acres for the traveller leaving the castle. That was where, she felt, Kip wentduring the day. Each morning he would step from the painted scene towards dark bluffs of chaos. The knight.
<br> 
<br> The warrior saint. She would see the khaki uniform flickering through the cypresses. The English.man hadcalled himfato profugus—fate’s fugitive. She guessed that these days began for him with the pleasure of liftinghis eyes up to the trees.
<br> 
<br> They had flown the sappers into Naples at the beginning of October 1943, selecting the best from the engineeringcorps that were already in southern Italy, Kip among the thirty men who were brought into the booby-trappedcity.
<br> 
<br> The Germans in the Italian campaign had choreographed one of the most brilliant and terrible retreats in history.
<br> 
<br> The advance of the Allies, which should have taken a month, took a year. There was fire in their path. Sappersrode the mud.guards of trucks as the armies moved forward, their eyes searching for fresh soil disturbances thatsignalled land mines or glass mines or shoe mines. The advance impossibly slow. Farther north in the mountains,partisan bands of Garibaldi communist groups, who wore identifying red handkerchiefs, were also wiringexplosives over the roads which detonated when German trucks passed over them.
<br> 
<br> The scale of the laying of mines in Italy and in North Africa cannot be imagined. At the Kismaayo-Afmadu roadjunction, 260 mines were found. There were 300 at the Omo River Bridge area. On June 30, 1941, South Africansappers laid 2,700 Mark 11 mines in Mersa Matruh in one day. Four months later the British cleared MersaMatruh of 7,806 mines and placed them elsewhere.
<br> 
<br> Mines were made out of everything. Forty-centimetre gal.vanized pipes were filled with explosives and leftalong military paths. Mines in wooden boxes were left in homes. Pipe mines were filled with gelignite, metalscraps and nails. South Afri.can sappers packed iron and gelignite into four-gallon petrol cans that could thendestroy armoured cars.
<br> 
<br> It was worst in the cities. Bomb disposal units, barely trained, were shipped out from Cairo and Alexandria. TheEighteenth Division became famous. During three weeks in October 1941, they dismantled 1,403 high-explosivebombs.
<br> 
<br> Italy was worse than Africa, the clockwork fuzes nightmar-ishly eccentric, the spring-activated mechanismsdifferent from the German ones that units had been trained in. As sappers entered cities they walked alongavenues where corpses were strung from trees or the balconies of buildings. The Germans often retaliated bykilling ten Italians for every German killed. Some of the hanging corpses were mined and had to be blown up inmidair.
<br> 
<br> The Germans evacuated Naples on October i, 1943. Dur.ing an Allied raid the previous September, hundreds ofciti.zens had walked away and begun living in the caves outside the city. The Germans in their retreat bombedthe entrance to the caves, forcing the citizens to stay underground. A ty.phus epidemic broke out. In the harbourscuttled ships were freshly mined underwater.
<br> 
<br> The thirty sappers walked into a city of booby traps. There were delayed-action bombs sealed into the walls ofpublic buildings. Nearly every vehicle was rigged. The sappers be.came permanently suspicious of any objectplaced casually in a room. They distrusted everything they saw on a table unless it was placed facing “fouro’clock.” Years after the war a sap.per putting a pen on a table would position it with the thicker end facing fouro’clock.
<br> 
<br> Naples continued as a war zone for six weeks and Kip was there with the unit for the whole period. After twoweeks they discovered the citizens in the caves. Their skin dark with shit and typhus. The procession of themback into the city hospi.tals was one of ghosts.
<br> 
<br> Four days later the central post office blew up, and seventy-two were killed or wounded. The richest collectionof mediae.val records in Europe had already burned in the city archives.
<br> 
<br> On the twentieth of October, three days before electricity was to be restored, a German turned himself in. He toldau.thorities that there were thousands of bombs hidden in the harbour section of the city that were wired to thedormant electrical system. When power was turned on, the city would dissolve in flames. He was interrogatedmore than seven times, in differing stages of tact and violence—at the end of which the authorities were stilluncertain about his confession. This time an entire area of the city was evacuated. Children and the old, thosealmost dead, those pregnant, those who had been brought out of the caves, animals, valuable jeeps, woundedsoldiers out of the hospitals, mental patients, priests and monks and nuns out of the abbeys. By dusk on theevening of October 22, 1943, only twelve sappers remained behind.
<br> 
<br> The electricity was to be turned on at three p.m. the next day. None of the sappers had ever been in an empty citybefore, and these were to be the strangest and most disturbing hours of their lives.
<br> 
<br> During the evenings thunderstorms roll over Tuscany. Light.ning drops towards any metal or spire that rises upout of the landscape. Kip always returns to the villa along the yellow path between the cypresses around seven inthe evening, which is when the thunder, if there is going to be thunder, begins. The mediaeval experience.
<br> 
<br> He seems to like such temporal habits. She or Caravaggio will see his figure in the distance, pausing in his walkhome to look back towards the valley to see how far away the rain is from him. Hana and Caravaggio return tothe house. Kip continues his half-mile uphill walk on the path that curls slowly to the right and then slowly to theleft. There is the noise of his boots on the gravel. The wind reaches him in bursts, hitting the cypresses broadsideso they tilt, entering the sleeves of his shirt.
<br> 
<br> For the next ten minutes he walks, never sure if the rain will overtake him. He will hear the rain before he feelsit, a clicking on the dry grass, on the olive leaves. But for now he is in the great refreshing wind of the hill, in theforeground of the storm.
<br> 
<br> If the rain reaches him before he gets to the villa, he contin.ues walking at the same pace, snaps the rubber capeover his haversack and walks on within it.
<br> 
<br> In his tent he hears the pure thunder. Sharp cracks of it overhead, a coach-wheel sound as it disappears into themoun.tains. A sudden sunlight of lightning through the tent wall, always, it seems to him, brighter than sunlight,a flash of contained phosphorus, something machinelike, to do with the new word he has heard in the theoryrooms and through his crystal set, which is “nuclear.” In the tent he unwinds the wet turban, dries his hair andweaves another around his head.
<br> 
<br> The storm rolls out of Piedmont to the south and to the east. Lightning falls upon the steeples of the small alpinechapels whose tableaux reenact the Stations of the Cross or the Mysteries of the Rosary. In the small towns ofVarese and Varallo, larger-than-life terra-cotta figures carved in the i6oos are revealed briefly, depicting biblicalscenes. The bound arms of the scourged Christ pulled back, the whip coming down, the baying dog, threesoldiers in the next chapel tableau rais.ing the crucifix higher towards the painted clouds.
<br> 
<br> The Villa San Girolamo, located where it is, also receives such moments of light—the dark halls, the room theEnglishman lies in, the kitchen where Hana is laying a fire, the shelled chapel—all lit suddenly, without shadow.
<br> 
<br> Kip will walk with no qualms under the trees in his patch of garden during such storms, the dangers of beingkilled by lightning pathetically minimal compared with the danger of his daily life. The naive Catholic imagesfrom those hillside shrines that he has seen are with him in the half-darkness, as he counts the seconds betweenlightning and thunder. Perhaps this villa is a similar tableau, the four of them in private movement, momentarilylit up, flung ironically against this war.
<br> 
<br> The twelve sappers who remained behind in Naples fanned out into the city. All through the night they havebroken into sealed tunnels, descended into sewers, looking for fuze lines that might be linked with the centralgenerators. They are to drive away at two p.m., an hour before the electricity is to be turned on.
<br> 
<br> A city of twelve. Each in separate parts of the town. One at the generator, one at the reservoir, still diving—theauthori.ties most certain destruction will be caused by flooding. How to mine a city. It is unnerving mostlybecause of the silence. All they hear of the human world are barking dogs and bird songs that come fromapartment windows above the streets. When the time comes, he will go into one of the rooms with a bird. Somehuman thing in this vacuum. He passes the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, where the remnants of Pompeii andHerculaneum are housed. He has seen the ancient dog frozen in white ash.
<br> 
<br> The scarlet sapper light strapped to his left arm is turned on as he walks, the only source of light on the StradaCarbonara. He is exhausted from the night search, and now there seems little to do. Each of them has aradiophone, but it is to be used only for an emergency discovery. It is the terrible silence in the empty courtyardsand the dry fountains that makes him most tired.
<br> 
<br> At one p.m. he traces his way towards the damaged Church of San Giovanni a Carbonara, where he knows thereis a chapel of the Rosary. He had been walking through the church a few evenings earlier when lightning filledthe dark.ness, and he had seen large human figures in the tableau. An angel and a woman in a bedroom.
<br> 
<br> Darkness replaced the brief scene and he sat in a pew waiting, but there was to be no more revelation.
<br> 
<br> He enters that corner of the church now, with the terra.cotta figures painted the colour of white humans. Thescene depicts a bedroom where a woman is in conversation with an angel. The woman’s curly brown hair revealsitself under the loose blue cape, the fingers of her left hand touching her breastbone. When he steps forward intothe room he realizes everything is larger than life. His own head is no higher than the shoulder of the woman.
<br> 
<br> The angel’s raised arm reaches fifteen feet in height. Still, for Kip, they are company. It is an inhabited room,and he walks within the discussion of these creatures that represent some fable about mankind and heaven.
<br> 
<br> He slips his satchel from his shoulder and faces the bed. He wants to lie on it, hesitating only because of thepresence of the angel. He has already walked around the ethereal body and noticed the dusty light bulbs attachedto its back beneath the dark coloured wings, and he knows in spite of his desire that he could not sleep easily inthe presence of such a thing. There are three pairs of stage slippers, a set designer’s subtlety, peek.ing out fromunder the bed. It is about one-forty.
<br> 
<br> He spreads his cape on the floor, flattens the satchel into a pillow and lies down on the stone. Most of hischildhood in Lahore he slept on a mat on the floor of his bedroom. And in truth he has never gotten accustomedto the beds of the West. A pallet and an air pillow are all he uses in his tent, whereas in England when stayingwith Lord Suffolk he sank claustro-phobically into the dough of a mattress, and lay there captive and awake untilhe crawled out to sleep on the carpet.
<br> 
<br> He stretches out beside the bed. The shoes too, he notices, are larger than life. The feet of Amazonians slip intothem. Above his head the tentative right arm of the woman. Beyond his feet the angel. Soon one of the sapperswill turn on the city’s electricity, and if he is going to explode he will do so in the company of these two. Theywill die or be secure. There is nothing more he can do, anyway. He has been up all night on a final search forcaches of dynamite and time cartridges. Walls will crumble around him or he will walk through a city of light. Atleast he has found these parental figures. He can relax in the midst of this mime of conversation.
<br> 
<br> He has his hands under his head, interpreting a new tough.ness in the face of the angel he didn’t notice before.
<br> 
<br> The white flower it holds has fooled him. The angel too is a warrior. In the midst of this series of thoughts hiseyes close and he gives in to tiredness.
<br> 
<br> He is sprawled out with a smile on his face, as if relieved finally to be sleeping, the luxuriousness of such a thing.
<br> 
<br> The palm of his left hand facedown on the concrete. The colour of his turban echoes that of the lace collar at theneck of Mary.
<br> 
<br> At her feet the small Indian sapper, in uniform, beside the six slippers. There seems to be no time here. Each ofthem has selected the most comfortable of positions to forget time. So we will be remembered by others. In suchsmiling comfort when we trust our surroundings. The tableau now, with Kip at the feet of the two figures,suggests a debate over his fate. The raised terra-cotta arm a stay of execution, a promise of some great future forthis sleeper, childlike, foreign-born. The three of them almost at the point of decision, agreement.
<br> 
<br> Under the thin layer of dust the angel’s face has a powerful joy. Attached to its back are the six light bulbs, twoof which are defunct. But in spite of that the wonder of electricity suddenly lights its wings from underneath, sothat their blood-red and blue and goldness the colour of mustard fields shine animated in the late afternoon.
<br> 
<br> Wherever Hana is now, in the future, she is aware of the line of movement Kip’s body followed out of her life.
<br> 
<br> Her mind repeats it. The path he slammed through among them. When he turned into a stone of silence in theirmidst. She recalls everything of that August day—what the sky was like, the objects on the table in front of hergoing dark under the thunder.
<br> 
<br> She sees him in the field, his hands clasped over his head, then realizes this is a gesture not of pain but of hisneed to hold the earphones tight against his brain. He is a hundred yards away from her in the lower field whenshe hears a scream emerge from his body which had never raised its voice among them. He sinks to his knees, asif unbuckled. Stays like that and then slowly gets up and moves in a diagonal towards his tent, enters it, andcloses the flaps behind him. There is the dry crackle of thunder and she sees her arms darken.
<br> 
<br> Kip emerges from the tent with the rifle. He comes into the Villa San Girolamo and sweeps past her, moving likea steel ball in an arcade game, through the doorway and up the stairs three steps at a time, his breathmetronomed, the hit of his boots against the vertical sections of stairs. She hears his feet along the hallway as shecontinues to sit at the table in the kitchen, the book in front of her, the pencil, these objects frozen and shadowedin the pre-storm light.
<br> 
<br> He enters the bedroom. He stands at the foot of the bed where the English patient lies. Hello, sapper.
<br> 
<br> The rifle stock is against his chest, its sling braced against his triangled arm.
<br> 
<br> What was going on outside?
<br> 
<br> Kip looks condemned, separate from the world, his brown face weeping. The body turns and fires into the oldfountain, and the plaster explodes dust onto the bed. He pivots back so the rifle points at the Englishman. Hebegins to shudder, and then everything in him tries to control that.
<br> 
<br> Put down the gun, Kip.
<br> 
<br> He slams his back against the wall and stops his shaking. Plaster dust in the air around them.
<br> 
<br> I sat at the foot of this bed and listened to you, Uncle. These last months. When I was a kid I did that, the samething. I believed I could fill myself up with what older people taught me. I believed I could carry that knowledge,slowly altering it, but in any case passing it beyond me to another.
<br> 
<br> I grew up with traditions from my country, but later, more often, from your country. Your fragile white islandthat with customs and manners and books and prefects and reason some.how converted the rest of the world.
<br> 
<br> You stood for precise behaviour. I knew if I lifted a teacup with the wrong finger I’d be banished. If I tied thewrong kind of knot in a tie I was out. Was it just ships that gave you such power? Was it, as my brother said,because you had the histories and printing presses?
<br> 
<br> You and then the Americans converted us. With your mis.sionary rules. And Indian soldiers wasted their livesas heroes so they could be pukkah. You had wars like cricket. How did you fool us into this? Here... listen towhat you people have done.
<br> 
<br> He throws the rifle on the bed and moves towards the Eng.lishman. The crystal set is at his side, hanging off hisbelt. He unclips it and puts the earphones over the black head of the patient, who winces at the pain on his scalp.
<br> 
<br> But the sapper leaves them on him. Then he walks back and picks up the rifle. He sees Hana at the door.
<br> 
<br> One bomb. Then another. Hiroshima. Nagasaki.
<br> 
<br> He swerves the rifle towards the alcove. The hawk in the valley air seems to float intentionally into the V sight.
<br> 
<br> If he closes his eyes he sees the streets of Asia full of fire. It rolls across cities like a burst map, the hurricane ofheat withering bodies as it meets them, the shadow of humans suddenly in the air. This tremor of Westernwisdom.
<br> 
<br> He watches the English patient, earphones on, the eyes focused inwards, listening. The rifle sight moves downthe thin nose to the Adam’s apple, above the collarbone. Kip stops breathing. Braced at exact right angles to theEnfield rifle. No waver.
<br> 
<br> Then the Englishman’s eyes look back at him.
<br> 
<br> Sapper.
<br> 
<br> Caravaggio enters the room and reaches for him, and Kip wheels the butt of the rifle into his ribs. A swat fromthe paw of an animal. And then, as if part of the same movement, he is back in the braced right-angle position ofthose in firing squads, drilled into him in various barracks in India and Eng.land. The burned neck in his sights.
<br> 
<br> Kip, talk to me.
<br> 
<br> Now his face is a knife. The weeping from shock and horror contained, seeing everything, all those around him,in a differ.ent light. Night could fall between them, fog could fall, and the young man’s dark brown eyes wouldreach the new re.vealed enemy.
<br> 
<br> My brother told me. Never turn your back on Europe. The deal makers. The contract makers. The map drawers.
<br> 
<br> Never trust Europeans, he said. Never shake hands with them. But we, oh, we were easily impressed—byspeeches and medals and your ceremonies. What have I been doing these last few years? Cutting away, defusing,limbs of evil. For what? For this to happen?
<br> 
<br> What is it? Jesus, tell us!
<br> 
<br> I’ll leave you the radio to swallow your history lesson. Don’t move again, Caravaggio. All those speeches ofcivilisation from kings and queens and presidents... such voices of abstract order. Smell it. Listen to the radio andsmell the celebration in it. In my country, when a father breaks justice in two, you kill the father.
<br> 
<br> You don’t know who this man is.
<br> 
<br> The rifle sight unwavering at the burned neck. Then the sapper swerves it up towards the man’s eyes.
<br> 
<br> Do it, Almasy says.
<br> 
<br> The eyes of the sapper and the patient meet in this half-dark room crowded now with the world.
<br> 
<br> He nods to the sapper.
<br> 
<br> Do it, he says quietly.
<br> 
<br> Kip ejects the cartridge and catches it as it begins to fall. He throws the rifle onto the bed, a snake, its venomcollected. He sees Hana on the periphery.
<br> 
<br> The burned man untugs the earphones off his head and slowly places them down in front of him. Then his lefthand reaches up and pulls away the hearing aid, and drops it to the floor.
<br> 
<br> Do it, Kip. I don’t want to hear any more.
<br> 
<br> He closes his eyes. Slips into darkness, away from the room.
<br> 
<br> The sapper leans against the wall, his hands folded, head down. Caravaggio can hear air being breathed in andout of his nostrils, fast and hard, a piston.
<br> 
<br> He isn’t an Englishman.
<br> 
<br> American, French, I don’t care. When you start bombing the brown races of the world, you’re an Englishman.
<br> 
<br> You had King Leopold of Belgium and now you have fucking Harry Truman of the USA. You all learned it fromthe English.
<br> 
<br> No. Not him. Mistake. Of all people he is probably on your side.
<br> 
<br> He would say that doesn’t matter, Hana says.
<br> 
<br> Caravaggio sits down in the chair. He is always, he thinks, sitting in this chair. In the room there is the thinsquawking from the crystal set, the radio still speaking in its underwater voice. He cannot bear to turn and look atthe sapper or look towards the blur of Hana’s frock. He knows the young soldier is right. They would never havedropped such a bomb on a white nation.
<br> 
<br> The sapper walks out of the room, leaving Caravaggio and Hana by the bed. He has left the three of them to theirworld, is no longer their sentinel. In the future, if and when the patient dies, Caravaggio and the girl will buryhim. Let the dead bury the dead. He has never been sure what that meant. Those few callous words in the Bible.
<br> 
<br> They will bury everything except the book. The body, the sheets, his clothes, the rifle. Soon he will be alone withHana. And the motive for all this on the radio. A terrible event emerging out of the shortwave. A new war. Thedeath of a civilisation.
<br> 
<br> Still night. He can hear nighthawks, their faint cries, the muted thud of wings as they turn. The cypress trees riseover his tent, still on this windless night. He lies back and stares into the dark corner of the tent. When he closeshis eyes he sees fire, people leaping into rivers into reservoirs to avoid flame or heat that within seconds burnseverything, whatever they hold, their own skin and hair, even the water they leap into. The brilliant bomb carriedover the sea in a plane, pass.ing the moon in the east, towards the green archipelago. And released.
<br> 
<br> He has not eaten food or drunk water, is unable to swallow anything. Before light failed he stripped the tent of allmilitary objects, all bomb disposal equipment, stripped all insignia off his uniform. Before lying down he undidthe turban and combed his hair out and then tied it up into a topknot and lay back, saw the light on the skin of thetent slowly disperse, his eyes holding onto the last blue of light, hearing the drop of wind into windlessness andthen hearing the swerve of the hawks as their wings thudded. And all the delicate noises of the air.
<br> 
<br> He feels all the winds of the world have been sucked into Asia. He steps away from the many small bombs of hiscareer towards a bomb the size, it seems, of a city, so vast it lets the living witness the death of the populationaround them. He knows nothing about the weapon. Whether it was a sudden assault of metal and explosion or ifboiling air scoured itself towards and through anything human. All he knows is, he feels he can no longer letanything approach him, cannot eat the food or even drink from a puddle on a stone bench on the terrace. He doesnot feel he can draw a mateh out of his bag and fire the lamp, for he believes the lamp will ignite every.thing. Inthe tent, before the light evaporated, he had brought out the photograph of his family and gazed at it. His name isKirpal Singh and he does not know what he is doing here.
<br> 
<br> He stands now under the trees in the August heat, untur-banned, wearing only a kurta. He carries nothing in hishands, just walks alongside the outline,of hedges, his bare feet on the grass or on terrace stone or in the ash of anold bonfire. His body alive in its sleeplessness, standing on the edge of a great valley of Europe.
<br> 
<br> In the early morning she sees him standing beside the tent. During the evening she had watched for some lightamong the trees. Each of them in the villa had eaten alone that night, the Englishman eating nothing. Now shesees the sapper’s arm sweep out and the canvas walls collapse on themselves like a sail. He turns and comestowards the house, climbs the steps onto the terrace and disappears.
<br> 
<br> In the chapel he moves past the burned pews towards the apse, where under a tarpaulin weighted down withbranches is the motorbike. He begins dragging the covering off the ma.chine. He crouches down by the bike andbegins nuzzling oil into the sprockets and cogs.
<br> 
<br> When Hana comes into the roofless chapel he is sitting there leaning his back and head against the wheel.
<br> 
<br> Kip.
<br> 
<br> He says nothing, looking through her.
<br> 
<br> Kip, it’s me. What did we have to do with it?
<br> 
<br> He is a stone in front of her.
<br> 
<br> She kneels down to his level and leans forward into him, the side of her head against his chest, holding herselflike that.
<br> 
<br> A beating heart.
<br> 
<br> When his stillness doesn’t alter she rolls back onto her knees.
<br> 
<br> The Englishman once read me something, from a book: “Love is so small it can tear itself through the eye of aneedle.”
<br> 
<br> He leans to his side away from her, his face stopping a few inches from a rain puddle.
<br> 
<br> A boy and a girl.
<br> 
<br> While the sapper unearthed the motorcycle from under the tarpaulin, Caravaggio leaned forward on the parapet,his chin against his forearm. Then he felt he couldn’t bear the mood of the house and walked away. He wasn’tthere when the sapper gunned the motorbike to life and sat on it while it half bucked, alive under him, and Hanastood nearby.
<br> 
<br> Singh touched her arm and let the machine roll away, down the slope, and only then revved it to life.
<br> 
<br> Halfway down the path to the gate, Caravaggio was waiting for him, carrying the gun. He didn’t even lift itformally towards the motorbike when the boy slowed down, as Caravag.gio walked into his path. Caravaggiocame up to him and put his arms around him. A great hug. The sapper felt the stubble against his skin for the firsttime. He felt drawn in, gathered into the muscles. “I shall have to learn how to miss you,” Caravaggio said. Thenthe boy pulled away and Caravaggio walked back to the house.
<br> 
<br> The machine broke into life around him. The smoke of the Triumph and dust and fine gravel fell away throughthe trees. The bike leapt the cattle grid at the gates, and then he was weaving down out of the village, passing thesmell of gardens on either side of him that were tacked onto the slopes in their treacherous angle.
<br> 
<br> His body slipped into a position of habit, his chest parallel with, almost touching, the petrol tank, his armshorizontal in the shape of least resistance. He went south, avoiding Flor.ence completely. Through Greve, acrossto Montevarchi and Ambra, small towns ignored by war and invasion. Then, as the new hills appeared, he beganto climb the spine of them towards Cortona.
<br> 
<br> He was travelling against the direction of the invasion, as if rewinding the spool of war, the route no longer tensewith military. He took only roads he knew, seeing the familiar cas.tle towns from a distance. He lay static on theTriumph as it burned under him in its tear along the country roads. He carried little, all weapons left behind. Thebike hurled through each village, not slowing for town or memory of war. “The earth shall reel to and fro like adrunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage.”
<br> 
<br> She opened up his knapsack. There was a pistol wrapped in oilskin, so that its smell was released when sheuncovered it. Toothbrush and tooth powder, pencil sketches in a notebook, including a drawing of her—she wassitting on the terrace and he had been looking down from the Englishman’s room. Two turbans, a bottle ofstarch. One sapper lamp with its leather straps, to be worn in emergencies. She flicked it on and the knapsackfilled with crimson light.
<br> 
<br> In the side pockets she found pieces of equipment to do with bomb disposal, which she didn’t wish to touch.
<br> 
<br> Wrapped up in another small piece of cloth was the metal spile she had given him, which was used for tappingmaple sugar out of a tree in her country.
<br> 
<br> From within the collapsed tent she unearthed a portrait that must have been of his family. She held thephotograph in her palm. A Sikh and his family.
<br> 
<br> An older brother who was only eleven in this picture. Kip beside him, eight years old. “When the war came mybrother sided with whoever was against the English,”
<br> 
<br> There was also a small handbook that had a map of bombs. And a drawing of a saint accompanied by a musician.
<br> 
<br> She packed everything back in except the photograph, which she held in her free hand. She carried the bagthrough the trees, walked across the loggia and brought it into the house.
<br> 
<br> Each hour or so he slowed to a stop, spat into the goggles and wiped dust off with the sleeve of his shirt. Helooked into the map again. He would go to the Adriatic, then south. Most of the troops were at the northernborders.
<br> 
<br> He climbed into Cortona, the high-pitched gunning of the bike all around him. He rode the Triumph up the stepsto the door of the church and then walked in. A statue was there, bandaged in scaffold. He wanted to get closer tothe face, but he had no rifle telescope and his body felt too stiff to climb up the construction pipes. He wanderedaround un.derneath like somebody unable to enter the intimacy of a home. He walked the bike down the churchsteps, and then coasted down through the shattered vineyards and went on to Arezzo.
<br> 
<br> At Sansepolcro he took a winding road into the mountains, into their mist, so he had to slow to minimal speed.
<br> 
<br> The Bocca Trabaria. He was cold but locked the weather out of his mind. Finally the road rose above thewhiteness, the mist a bed behind him. He skirted Urbino where the Germans had burned all the field horses ofthe enemy. They had fought here in this region for a month; now he slid through in minutes, recognizing only theBlack Madonna shrines. The war had made all the cities and towns similar.
<br> 
<br> He came down towards the coast. Into Gabicce Mare, where he had seen the Virgin emerge from the sea. Heslept on the hill, overlooking cliff and water, near where the statue had been taken. That was the end of his firstday.
<br> 
<br> Dear Clara—Dear Maman,Maman is a French word, Clara, a circular word, suggest.ing cuddles, a personal word that can be even shoutedin public. Something as comforting and as eternal as a barge. Though you, in spirit, I know are still a canoe. Canswerve one around and enter a creek in seconds. Still independent. Still private. Not a barge responsible for allaround you. This is my first letter in years, Clara, and I am not used to the formality of them. I have spent the lastfew months living with three others, and our talk has been slow, casual. I am not used to talking in any way butthat now.
<br> 
<br> The year is 194-. What? For a second I forget. But I know the month and the day. One day after we heard thebombs were dropped in japan, so it feels like the end of the world. From now on I believe the personal willforever be at war with the public. If we can rationalize this we can rationalize anything.
<br> 
<br> Patrick died in a dove-cot in France. In France in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries they built them huge,larger than most houses. Like this.
<br> 
<br> The horizontal line one-third of the way down was called the rat ledge—to stop rats running up the brick, so thedoves would be safe. Safe as a dove-cot. A sacred place. Like a church in many ways. A comforting place.
<br> 
<br> Patrick died in a comforting place.
<br> 
<br> At five a.m. he kicked the Triumph to life, and the rear wheel threw gravel in a skirt. He was still in darkness,still unable to distinguish sea in the vista beyond the cliff. For the journey from here to the south he had no maps,but he could recognize the war roads and follow the coast route. When sunlight came he was able to double hisspeed. The rivers were still ahead of him.
<br> 
<br> Around two in the afternoon he reached Ortona, where the sappers had laid the Bailey bridges, nearly drowningin the storm in mid-river. It began to rain and he stopped to put on a rubber cape. He walked around the machinein the wetness. Now, as he travelled, the sound in his ears changed. The shush shush replacing the whine andhowl, the water flung onto his boots from the front wheel. Everything he saw through the goggles was grey. Hewould not think of Hana. In all the silence within the bike’s noise he did not think of her.
<br> 
<br> When her face appeared he erased it, pulled the handlebars so he would swerve and have to concentrate. If therewere to be words they would not be hers; they would be names on this map of Italy he was riding through.
<br> 
<br> He feels he carries the body of the Englishman with him in this flight. It sits on the petrol tank facing him, theblack body in an embrace with his, facing the past over his shoulder, facing the countryside they are flying from,that receding pal.ace of strangers on the Italian hill which shall never be re.built. “And my words which I haveput in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth. Nor out of the mouth of thy seed. Nor out of the mouth of thyseed’s seed.”
<br> 
<br> The voice of the English patient sang Isaiah into his ear as he had that afternoon when the boy had spoken of theface on the chapel ceiling in Rome. “There are of course a hundred Isaiahs. Someday you will want to see him asan old man—in southern France the abbeys celebrate him as bearded and old, but the power is still there in hislook.” The Englishman had sung out into the painted room. “Behold, the Lord will carry thee away with amighty captivity, and He will surely cover thee. He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a largecountry.”
<br> 
<br> He was riding deeper into thick rain. Because he had loved the face on the ceiling he had loved the words. As hehad believed in the burned man and the meadows of civilisation he tended. Isaiah and Jeremiah and Solomonwere in the burned man’s bedside book, his holy book, whatever he had loved glued into his own. He had passedhis book to the sapper, and the sapper had said we have a Holy Book too.
<br> 
<br> The rubber lining on the goggles had cracked during the past months and the rain now began filling each pocketof air in front of his eyes. He would ride without them, the shush shush a permanent sea in his ears, and hiscrouched body stiff, cold, so there was only the idea of heat from this machine he rode so intimately, the whitespray of it as he slid through villages like a slipping star, a half-second of visitation when one could make a wish.
<br> 
<br> “For the heavens shall vanish away like smoke and the earth shall wax old like a garment. And they that dwelltherein shall die in like manner. For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worms shall eat them likewool.” A secret of deserts from Uweinat to Hiroshima.
<br> 
<br> He was removing the goggles as he came out of the curve and onto the bridge over the Ofanto River. And withhis left arm up holding the goggles free he began to skid. He dropped them and calmed the bike but was notprepared for the iron bounce onto the lip of the bridge, the bike lying down to the right underneath him. He wassuddenly sliding with it along the skin of rainwater down the centre of the bridge, blue sparks from thescratching metal around his arms and face.
<br> 
<br> Heavy tin flew off and shouldered past him. Then he and the bike veered to the left, there was no side to thebridge, and they hurtled out parallel to the water, he and the bike side.ways, his arms flung back above his head.
<br> 
<br> The cape released itself away from him, from whatever was machine and mortal, part of the element of air.
<br> 
<br> The motorbike and the soldier stilled in midair, then pivoted down into the water, the metal body between hislegs as they slammed into it, jarring a white path through it, disappearing, the rain too entering the river. “He willtoss thee like a ball into a large country.”
<br> 
<br> How did Patrick end up in a dove-cot, Clara? His unit had left him, burned and wounded. So burned the buttonsof his shirt were part of his skin, part of his dear chest. That I kissedand you kissed. And how was my father burned? He who could swerve like an eel, or like your canoe, as ifcharmed, from the real world. In his sweet and complicated innocence. He was the most unverbal of men, and Iam always surprised women liked him. We tend to like a verbal man around us. We are the rationalists, the wise,and he was often lost, uncertain, unspoken.
<br> 
<br> He was a burned man and I was a nurse and I could have nursed him. Do you understand the sadness ofgeography? I could have saved him or at least been with him till the end. I know a lot about burning. How longwas he alone with doves and rats? With the last stages of blood and life in him? Doves over him. The flutterwhen they thrashed around him. Unable to sleep in the darkness. He always hated darkness. And he was alone,without lover or kin.
<br> 
<br> I am sick of Europe, Clara. 1 want to come home. To your small cabin and pink rock in Georgian Bay. I will takea bus up to Parry Sound. And from the mainland send a message over the shortwave radio out towards thePancakes. And wait for you, wait to see the silhouette of you in a canoe coming to rescue me from this place weall entered, betraying you. How did you become so smart? How did you become so determined? How were younot fooled like us? You that demon for pleasure who became so wise. The purest among us, the darkest bean, thegreenest leaf.
<br> 
<br> HanaThe sapper’s bare head comes out of the water, and he gasps in all the air above the river.
<br> 
<br> Caravaggio has made a one-strand bridge with hemp rope down to the roof of the next villa. The rope istightened at this end round the waist of the statue of Demetrius and then secured to the well. The rope barelyhigher than the tops of the two olive trees along his path. If he loses his balance he will fall into the rough dustyarms of the olive.
<br> 
<br> He steps onto it, his socked feet gripping the hemp. How valuable is that statue? he once asked Hana casually,and she told him the English patient had said all statues of Demetrius were worthless.
<br> 
<br> She seals the letter and stands up, moves across the room to close the window, and at that moment lightning slipsthrough the valley. She sees Caravaggio in midair halfway across the gorge that lies like a deep scar alongsidethe villa. She stands there as if in one of her dreams, then climbs into the window alcove and sits there lookingout.
<br> 
<br> Every time there is lightning, rain freezes in the suddenly lit night. She sees the buzzard hawks flung up into thesky, looks for Caravaggio.
<br> 
<br> He is halfway across when he smells the rain, and then it begins to fall all over his body, clinging to him, andsuddenly there is the greater weight of his clothes.
<br> 
<br> She puts her cupped palms out of the window and combs the rain into her hair.
<br> 
<br> The villa drifts in darkness. In the hallway by the English patient’s bedroom the last candle burns, still alive inthe night.
<br> 
<br> Whenever he opens his eyes out of sleep, he sees the old wavering yellow light.
<br> 
<br> For him now the world is without sound, and even light seems an unneeded thing. He will tell the girl in themorning he wants no candle flame to accompany him while he sleeps.
<br> 
<br> Around three a.m. he feels a presence in the room. He sees, for a pulse of a moment, a figure at the foot of hisbed, against the wall or painted onto it perhaps, not quite discernible in the darkness of foliage beyond thecandlelight. He mutters something, something he had wanted to say, but there is si.lence and the slight brownfigure, which could be just a night shadow, does not move. A poplar. A man with plumes. A swimming figure.
<br> 
<br> And he would not be so lucky, he thinks, to speak to the young sapper again.
<br> 
<br> He stays awake in any case this night, to see if the figure moves towards him. Ignoring the tablet that bringspainless-ness, he will remain awake till the light dies out and the smell of candle smoke drifts into his room andinto the girl’s room farther down the hall. If the figure turns around there will be paint on his back, where heslammed in grief against the mural of trees. When the candle dies out he will be able to see this. His hand reachesout slowly and touches his book and re.turns to his dark chest. Nothing else moves in the room.
<br> 
<br> Now where does he sit as he thinks of her? These years later. A stone of history skipping over the water,bouncing up so she and he have aged before it touches the surface again and sinks.
<br> 
<br> Where does he sit in his garden thinking once again he should go inside and write a letter or go one day down tothe telephone depot, fill out a form and try to contact her in an.other country. It is this garden, this square patchof dry cut grass that triggers him back to the months he spent with Hana and Caravaggio and the English patientnorth of Florence in the Villa San Girolamo. He is a doctor, has two children and a laughing wife. He ispermanently busy in this city. At six p.m. he removes his white lab coat. Underneath he wears dark trousers anda short-sleeved shirt. He closes up the clinic, where all the paperwork has weights of various kinds—stones,inkpots, a toy truck his son no longer plays with—to keep it from being blown away by the fan. He climbs ontohis bicycle and pedals the four miles home, through the bazaar. When.ever he can he swerves his bicycle over tothe shadowed part of the street. He has reached an age when he suddenly realizes that the sun of India exhaustshim.
<br> 
<br> He glides under the willows by the canal and then stops at a small neighbourhood of houses, removes his cycleclips and carries the bicycle down the steps into the small garden his wife has nurtured.
<br> 
<br> And something this evening has brought the stone out of the water and allowed it to move back within the airtowards the hill town in Italy. It was perhaps the chemical burn on the arm of the girl he treated today. Or thestone stairway, where brown weeds grow ardently along the steps. He had been carrying his bicycle and washalfway up the steps before he remembered. This had been on the way to work, so the trigger of memory waspostponed when he got to the hospital and ran into seven hours of constant patients and administra.tion. Or itmight have been the burn on the young girl’s arm. He sits in the garden. And he watches Hana, her hair longer,in her own country. And what does she do? He sees her always, her face and body, but he doesn’t know what herprofession is or what her circumstances are, although he sees her reactions to people around her, her bendingdown to chil.dren, a white fridge door behind her, a background of noiseless tram cars. This is a limited gift hehas somehow been given, as if a camera’s film reveals her, but only her, in silence. He cannot discern thecompany she moves among, her judgement; all he can witness is her character and the lengthening of her darkhair, which falls again and then again into her eyes.
<br> 
<br> She will, he realizes now, always have a serious face. She has moved from being a young woman into having theangular look of a queen, someone who has made her face with her desire to be a certain kind of person. He stilllikes that about her. Her smartness, the fact that she did not inherit that look or that beauty, but that it wassomething searched for and that it will always reflect a present stage of her character. It seems every month ortwo he witnesses her this way, as if these moments of revelation are a continuation of the letters she wrote to himfor a year, getting no reply, until she stopped sending them, turned away by his silence. His character, hesupposed.
<br> 
<br> Now there are these urges to talk with her during a meal and return to that stage they were most intimate at in thetent or in the English patient’s room, both of which contained the turbulent river of space between them.
<br> 
<br> Recalling the time, he is just as fascinated at himself there as he is with her—boyish and earnest, his lithe armmoving across the air towards the girl he has fallen in love with. His wet boots are by the Italian door, the lacestied together, his arm reaches for her shoulder, there is the prone figure on the bed.
<br> 
<br> During the evening meal he watches his daughter struggling with her cutlery, trying to hold the large weapons inher small hands. At this table all of their hands are brown. They move with ease in their customs and habits. Andhis wife has taught them all a wild humour, which has been inherited by his son. He loves to see his son’s wit inthis house, how it surprises him constantly, going beyond even his and his wife’s knowl.edge and humour—theway he treats dogs on the streets, imitating their stroll, their look. He loves the fact that this boy can almost guessthe wishes of dogs from the variety of expres.sions at a dog’s disposal.
<br> 
<br> And Hana moves possibly in the company that is not her choice. She, at even this age, thirty-four, has not foundher own company, the ones she wanted. She is a woman of honour and smartness whose wild love leaves outluck, always taking risks, and there is something in her brow now that only she can recognize in a mirror. Idealand idealistic in that shiny dark hair! People fall in love with her. She still remembers the lines of poems theEnglishman read out loud to her from his commonplace book. She is a woman I don’t know well enough to holdin my wing, if writers have wings, to harbour for the rest of my life. And so Hana moves and her face turns andin a regret shelowers her hair. Her shoulder touches the edge of a cupboard and a glass dislodges. Kirpal’s left hand swoopsdown and catches the dropped fork an inch from the floor and gently passes it into the fingers of his daughter, awrinkle at the edge of his eyes behind his spectacles.
