<br> 
<br> “To say? Something to his wife, who appears to have lashed herself into an extraordinary state.”
<br> 
<br> The young man’s face fell. “What sort of a state?”
<br> 
<br> “A strange discouragement about herself. She’s depressed and frightened she thinks she’s sinking.”
<br> 
<br> Dennis looked grave. “ Poor little lady what a bore for us! I remember her perfectly.”
<br> 
<br> “She of course remembers you,” Rose said. “ She takes the friendliest interest in your being here.”
<br> 
<br> “That’s most kind of her in her condition.”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, her condition,” Rose returned, “ isn’t quite so bad as she thinks.”
<br> 
<br> “I see.” Dennis hesitated. “And that’s what Mr. Bream’s to tell her.”
<br> 
<br> “That’s a part of it.” Rose glanced at the docu ment he had brought to her; it was in its enve lope, and he tapped it a little impatiently on his left finger-tips. What she said, however, had no reference to it. “ She’s haunted with a morbid alarm on the subject, of all things, of his marry ing again.”
<br> 
<br> “If she should die? She wants him not to? ” Dennis asked.
<br> 
<br> “She wants him not to.” Rose paused a moment. “ She wants to have been the only one.”
<br> 
<br> He reflected, slightly embarrassed with this peep into a situation that but remotely concerned him. “Well, I suppose that’s the way women often feel.”
<br> 
<br> “I daresay it is.” The girl’s gravity gave the gleam of a smile. “ I daresay it’s the way I should.”
<br> 
<br> Dennis Vidal, at this, simply seized her and kissed her. “ You needn’t be afraid you’ll be the only one! ”
<br> 
<br> His embrace had been the work of a few seconds, and she had made no movement to escape from it; but she looked at him as if to convey that the extreme high spirits it betrayed were perhaps just a trifle mistimed. “ That’s what I recommended him,” she dropped, “ to say to Julia.”
<br> 
<br> “Why, I should hope so! ” Presently, as if a little struck, Dennis continued: “ Doesn’t he want to?”
<br> 
<br> “Absolutely. They’re all in all to each other. But he’s naturally much upset and bewildered.”
<br> 
<br> “And he came to you for advice? ”
<br> 
<br> “Oh, he comes to me,” Rose said, “ as he might come to talk of her with the mother that, poor dar ling, it’s her misfortune never to have known,”
<br> 
<br> The young man’s vivacity again played up. “He treats you, you mean, as his mother-in-law? ”
<br> 
<br> “Very much. But I’m thoroughly nice to him. People can do anything to me who are nice to Julia.”
<br> 
<br> Dennis was silent a moment; he had slipped his letter out of its cover. “Well, I hope they’re grateful to you for such devotion.”
<br> 
<br> “Grateful to me, Dennis? They quite adore me.” Then as if to remind him of something it was important he should feel: “ Don’t you see what it is for a poor girl to have such an anchorage as this such honourable countenance, such a place to fall back upon? ”
<br> 
<br> Thus challenged, her visitor, with a moment’s thought, did frank justice to her question. “ I’m certainly glad you’ve such jolly friends one sees they’re charming people. It has been a great comfort to me lately to know you were with them.” He looked round him, conscientiously, at the bright and beautiful hall. “ It is a good berth, my dear, and it must be a pleasure to live with such fine things. They’ve given me a room up there that’s full of them an awfully nice room.” He glanced at a picture or two he took in the scene. “ Do they roll in wealth? ”
<br> 
<br> “They’re like all bankers, I imagine,” said Rose. “Don’t bankers always roll? ”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, they seem literally to wallow. What, a pity we ain’t bankers, eh? ”
<br> 
<br> “Ah, with my friends here their money’s the least part of them,” the girl answered. “ The great thing’s their personal goodness.”
<br> 
<br> Dennis had stopped before a large photograph, a great picture in a massive frame, supported, on a table, by a small gilded easel. “ To say nothing of their personal beauty! He’s tremendously good-looking.”
<br> 
<br> Rose glanced with an indulgent sigh at a representation of Tony Bream in all his splen dour, in a fine white waistcoat and a high white hat, with a stick and gloves and a cigar, his orchid, his stature and his smile. “ Ah, poor Julia’s taste! ”
<br> 
<br> “Yes,” Dennis exclaimed, “ one can see how he must have fetched her! ”
<br> 
<br> “I mean the style of the thing,” said Rose.
<br> 
<br> “It isn’t good, eh? Well, you know.” Then turning away from the picture, the young man added: “ They’ll be after that fellow! ”
<br> 
<br> Rose faltered. “ The people she fears? ”
<br> 
<br> “The women-folk, bless ’em if he should lose her.”
<br> 
<br> “I daresay,” said Rose. “ But he’ll be proof.”
<br> 
<br> “Has he told you so? ” Dennis smiled.
<br> 
<br> She met his smile with a kind of conscious bravado in her own. “ In so many words. But he assures me he’ll calm her down.”
<br> 
<br> Dennis was silent a little: he had now unfolded his letter and run his eyes over it. “ What a funny subject for him to be talking about! ”
<br> 
<br> “With me, do you mean? ”
<br> 
<br> “Yes, and with his wife.”
<br> 
<br> “My dear man,” Rose exclaimed, “you can imagine he didn’t begin it! ”
<br> 
<br> “Did you?” her companion asked.
<br> 
<br> She hesitated again, and then, “ Yes idiot! ” she replied with a quiet humour that produced, on his part, another demonstration of tenderness. This attempt she arrested, raising her hand, as she appeared to have heard a sound, with a quick injunction to listen.
<br> 
<br> “What’s the matter? ”
<br> 
<br> She bent her ear. “ Wasn’t there a cry from Julia’s room? ”
<br> 
<br> “I heard nothing.”
<br> 
<br> Rose was relieved. “ Then it’s only my nervous ness.”
<br> 
<br> Dennis Vidal held up his letter. “ Is your nervousness too great to prevent your giving a moment’s attention to this? ”
<br> 
<br> “Ah, your letter! ” Rose’s eyes rested on it as if she had become conscious of it for the first time.
<br> 
<br> “It very intimately concerns our future,” said her visitor. “ I went up for it so that you should do me the favour to read it.”
<br> 
<br> She held out her hand promptly and frankly. “Then give it to me let me keep it a little.”
<br> 
<br> “Certainly; but kindly remember that I’ve still to answer it I mean referring to points. I’ve waited to see you because it’s from the ‘ governor ’ himself practically saying what he’ll do for me.”
<br> 
<br> Rose held the letter; her large light eyes widened with her wonder and her sympathy. “ Is it some thing very good? ”
<br> 
<br> Dennis prescribed, with an emphatic but amused nod at the paper, a direction to her curiosity. “Read and you’ll see !”
<br> 
<br> She dropped her eyes, but after a moment, while her left hand patted her heart, she raised them with an odd, strained expression. “ I mean is it really good enough? ”
<br> 
<br> “That’s exactly what I want you to tell me! ” Dennis laughed out. A certain surprise at her manner was in his face.
<br> 
<br> While she noted it she heard a sound again, a sound this time explained by the opening of the door of the vestibule. Doctor Ramage had come back; Rose put down her letter. “I’ll tell you as soon as I have spoken to the Doctor.”
