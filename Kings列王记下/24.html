<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and rebelled against him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; In his days, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came up and Jehoiakim was his servant for three years; then he took up arms against him. 
<br>24:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 和 华 使 迦 勒 底 军 ， 亚 兰 军 ， 摩 押 军 ， 和 亚 扪 人 的 军 来 攻 击 约 雅 敬 ， 毁 灭 犹 大 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 借 他 仆 人 众 先 知 所 说 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servants the prophets. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the Lord sent against him bands of the Chaldaeans and of the Edomites and of the Moabites and of the children of Ammon; sending them against Judah for its destruction, as he had said by his servants the prophets. 
<br>24:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 祸 临 到 犹 大 人 ， 诚 然 是 耶 和 华 所 命 的 ， 要 将 他 们 从 自 己 面 前 赶 出 ， 是 因 玛 拿 西 所 犯 的 一 切 罪 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he did; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Only by the word of the Lord did this fate come on Judah, to take them away from before his face; because of the sins of Manasseh and all the evil he did; 
<br>24:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 又 因 他 流 无 辜 人 的 血 ， 充 满 了 耶 路 撒 冷 。 耶 和 华 决 不 肯 赦 免 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And because of the death of those who had done no wrong, for he made Jerusalem full of the blood of the upright; and the Lord had no forgiveness for it. 
<br>24:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 雅 敬 其 余 的 事 ， 凡 他 所 行 的 都 写 在 犹 大 列 王 记 上 。&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.

<br>24:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 巴 比 伦 王 将 耶 和 华 殿 和 王 宫 里 的 宝 物 都 拿 去 了 ， 将 以 色 列 王 所 罗 门 所 造 耶 和 华 殿 里 的 金 器 都 毁 坏 了 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 所 说 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he took away all the stored wealth of the Lord's house, and the goods from the king's store-house, cutting up all the gold vessels which Solomon, king of Israel, had made in the house of the Lord, as the Lord had said. 
<br>24:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 又 将 耶 路 撒 冷 的 众 民 和 众 首 领 ， 并 所 有 大 能 的 勇 士 ， 共 一 万 人 ， 连 一 切 木 匠 ， 铁 匠 都 掳 了 去 。 除 了 国 中 极 贫 穷 的 人 以 外 ， 没 有 剩 下 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people of the land. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he took away all the people of Jerusalem and all the chiefs and all the men of war, ten thousand prisoners; and all the expert workmen and the metal-workers; only the poorest sort of the people of the land were not taken away. 
<br>24:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 并 将 约 雅 斤 和 王 母 ， 后 妃 ， 太 监 ， 与 国 中 的 大 官 ， 都 从 耶 路 撒 冷 掳 到 巴 比 伦 去 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; He took Jehoiachin a prisoner to Babylon, with his mother and his wives and his unsexed servants and the great men of the land; he took them all as prisoners from Jerusalem to Babylon. 
<br>24:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 又 将 一 切 勇 士 七 千 人 和 木 匠 ， 铁 匠 一 千 人 ， 都 是 能 上 阵 的 勇 士 ， 全 掳 到 巴 比 伦 去 了 。&nbsp;

<br>24:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 巴 比 伦 王 立 约 雅 斤 的 叔 叔 玛 探 雅 代 替 他 作 王 ， 给 玛 探 雅 改 名 叫 西 底 家 。&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, as Jehoiakim had done. 
<br>24:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 因 此 耶 和 华 的 怒 气 在 耶 路 撒 冷 和 犹 大 发 作 ， 以 致 将 人 民 从 自 己 面 前 赶 出 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And because of the wrath of the Lord, this came about in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had sent them all away from before him: and Zedekiah took up arms against the king of Babylon.
