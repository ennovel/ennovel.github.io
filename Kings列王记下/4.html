<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now a certain woman, the wife of one of the sons of the prophets, came crying to Elisha and said, Your servant my husband is dead; and to your knowledge he was a worshipper of the Lord; but now, the creditor has come to take my two children as servants in payment of his debt. 
<br>4:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 利 沙 问 她 说 ， 我 可 以 为 你 作 什 么 呢 ？ 你 告 诉 我 ， 你 家 里 有 什 么 。 她 说 ， 婢 女 家 中 除 了 一 瓶 油 之 外 ， 没 有 什 么 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Elisha said to her, What am I to do for you? say now, what have you in the house? And she said, Your servant has nothing in the house but a pot of oil. 
<br>4:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 利 沙 说 ， 你 去 ， 向 你 众 邻 舍 借 空 器 皿 ， 不 要 少 借 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then he said, Go out to all your neighbours and get vessels, a very great number of them. 
<br>4:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 回 到 家 里 ， 关 上 门 ， 你 和 你 儿 子 在 里 面 将 油 倒 在 所 有 的 器 皿 里 ， 倒 满 了 的 放 在 一 边 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then go in, and, shutting the door on yourself and your sons, put oil into all these vessels, putting on one side the full ones. 
<br>4:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 ， 妇 人 离 开 以 利 沙 去 了 ， 关 上 门 ， 自 己 和 儿 子 在 里 面 。 儿 子 把 器 皿 拿 来 ， 她 就 倒 油 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So she went away, and when the door was shut on her and her sons, they took the vessels to her and she put oil into them. 
<br>4:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 器 皿 都 满 了 ， 她 对 儿 子 说 ， 再 给 我 拿 器 皿 来 。 儿 子 说 ， 再 没 有 器 皿 了 。 油 就 止 住 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said unto her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when all the vessels were full, she said to her son, Get me another vessel. And he said, There are no more. And the flow of oil was stopped. 
<br>4:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 妇 人 去 告 诉 神 人 ， 神 人 说 ， 你 去 卖 油 还 债 ， 所 剩 的 你 和 你 儿 子 可 以 靠 着 度 日 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children of the rest. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So she came to the man of God and gave him word of what she had done. And he said, Go and get money for the oil and make payment of your debt, and let the rest be for the needs of yourself and your sons. 
<br>4:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 一 日 ， 以 利 沙 走 到 书 念 ， 在 那 里 有 一 个 大 户 的 妇 人 强 留 他 吃 饭 。 此 后 ， 以 利 沙 每 从 那 里 经 过 就 进 去 吃 饭 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now there came a day when Elisha went to Shunem, and there was a woman of high position living there, who made him come in and have a meal with her. And after that, every time he went by, he went into her house for a meal. 
<br>4:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 妇 人 对 丈 夫 说 ， 我 看 出 那 常 从 我 们 这 里 经 过 的 是 圣 洁 的 神 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And she said unto her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passeth by us continually. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And she said to her husband, Now I see that this is a holy man of God, who comes by day after day. 
<br>4:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 们 可 以 为 他 在 墙 上 盖 一 间 小 楼 ， 在 其 中 安 放 床 榻 ， 桌 子 ， 椅 子 ， 灯 台 ， 他 来 到 我 们 这 里 ， 就 可 以 住 在 其 间 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in thither. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So let us make a little room on the wall; and put a bed there for him, and a table and a seat and a light; so that when he comes to us, he will be able to go in there. 
<br>4:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 一 日 ， 以 利 沙 来 到 那 里 ， 就 进 了 那 楼 躺 卧 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now one day, when he had gone there, he went into the little room and took his rest there. 
<br>4:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 利 沙 吩 咐 仆 人 基 哈 西 说 ， 你 叫 这 书 念 妇 人 来 。 他 就 把 妇 人 叫 了 来 ， 妇 人 站 在 以 利 沙 面 前 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said to Gehazi, his servant, Send for this Shunammite. So in answer to his voice she came before him. 
<br>4:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 利 沙 吩 咐 仆 人 说 ， 你 对 她 说 ， 你 既 为 我 们 费 了 许 多 心 思 ， 可 以 为 你 作 什 么 呢 ？ 你 向 王 或 元 帅 有 所 求 的 没 有 ？ 她 回 答 说 ， 我 在 我 本 乡 安 居 无 事 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said unto him, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among mine own people. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said to him, Now say to her, See, you have taken all this trouble for us; what is to be done for you? will you have any request made for you to the king or the captain of the army? But she said, I am living among my people. 
<br>4:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 利 沙 对 仆 人 说 ， 究 竟 当 为 她 作 什 么 呢 ？ 基 哈 西 说 ， 她 没 有 儿 子 ， 她 丈 夫 也 老 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi made answer, Still there is this, she has no son and her husband is old. 
<br>4:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 利 沙 说 ， 再 叫 她 来 。 于 是 叫 了 她 来 ， 她 就 站 在 门 口 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then he said, Send for her. And in answer to his voice she took her place at the door. 
<br>4:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 利 沙 说 ， 明 年 到 这 时 候 ， 你 必 抱 一 个 儿 子 。 她 说 ， 神 人 ， 我 主 阿 ， 不 要 那 样 欺 哄 婢 女 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie unto thine handmaid. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Elisha said, At this time in the coming year you will have a son in your arms. And she said, No, my lord, O man of God, do not say what is false to your servant. 
<br>4:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 妇 人 果 然 怀 孕 ， 到 了 那 时 候 ， 生 了 一 个 儿 子 ， 正 如 以 利 沙 所 说 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the woman conceived, and bare a son at that season that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the woman became with child and gave birth to a son at the time named, in the year after, as Elisha had said to her. 
<br>4:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 孩 子 渐 渐 长 大 ， 一 日 到 他 父 亲 和 收 割 的 人 那 里 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now one day, when the child was older, he went out to his father to where the grain was being cut. 
<br>4:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 对 父 亲 说 ， 我 的 头 阿 ， 我 的 头 阿 。 他 父 亲 对 仆 人 说 ， 把 他 抱 到 他 母 亲 那 里 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said to his father, My head, my head! And the father said to a servant, Take him in to his mother. 
<br>4:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 仆 人 抱 去 ， 交 给 他 母 亲 。 孩 子 坐 在 母 亲 的 膝 上 ， 到 晌 午 就 死 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he took him in to his mother, and she took him on her knees and kept him there till the middle of the day, when his life went from him. 
<br>4:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 母 亲 抱 他 上 了 楼 ， 将 他 放 在 神 人 的 床 上 ， 关 上 门 出 来 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then she went up and put him on the bed of the man of God, shutting the door on him, and went out. 
<br>4:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 呼 叫 她 丈 夫 说 ， 你 叫 一 个 仆 人 给 我 牵 一 匹 驴 来 ， 我 要 快 快 地 去 见 神 人 ， 就 回 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And she called unto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And she said to her husband, Send me one of the servants and one of the asses so that I may go quickly to the man of God and come back again. 
<br>4:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 丈 夫 说 ， 今 日 不 是 月 朔 ， 也 不 是 安 息 日 ， 你 为 何 要 去 见 他 呢 ？ 妇 人 说 ， 平 安 无 事 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said, Wherefore wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said, Why are you going to him today? it is not a new moon or a Sabbath. But she said, It is well. 
<br>4:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 备 上 驴 ， 对 仆 人 说 ， 你 快 快 赶 着 走 ， 我 若 不 吩 咐 你 ， 就 不 要 迟 慢 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then she made the ass ready and said to her servant, Keep driving on; do not make a stop without orders from me. 
<br>4:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 妇 人 就 往 迦 密 山 去 见 神 人 。 神 人 远 远 地 看 见 她 ， 对 仆 人 基 哈 西 说 ， 看 哪 ， 书 念 的 妇 人 来 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So she went and came unto the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So she went, and came to Mount Carmel, to the man of God. And when the man of God saw her coming in his direction, he said to Gehazi, his servant, See, there is the Shunammite; 
<br>4:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 跑 去 迎 接 她 ， 问 她 说 ， 你 平 安 吗 ？ 你 丈 夫 平 安 吗 ？ 孩 子 平 安 吗 ？ 她 说 ， 平 安 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say unto her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Go quickly to her, and on meeting her say to her, Are you well? and your husband and the child, are they well? And she said in answer, All is well. 
<br>4:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 妇 人 上 了 山 ， 到 神 人 那 里 ， 就 抱 住 神 人 的 脚 。 基 哈 西 前 来 要 推 开 她 ， 神 人 说 ， 由 她 吧 。 因 为 她 心 里 愁 苦 ， 耶 和 华 向 我 隐 瞒 ， 没 有 指 示 我 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when she came to where the man of God was on the hill, she put her hands round his feet; and Gehazi came near with the purpose of pushing her away; but the man of God said, Let her be, for her soul is bitter in her; and the Lord has kept it secret from me, and has not given me word of it. 
<br>4:28 [hgb]&nbsp; 妇 人 说 ， 我 何 尝 向 我 主 求 过 儿 子 呢 ？ 我 岂 没 有 说 过 ， 不 要 欺 哄 我 吗 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then she said, Did I make a request to my lord for a son? did I not say, Do not give me false words? 
<br>4:29 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 利 沙 吩 咐 基 哈 西 说 ， 你 束 上 腰 ， 手 拿 我 的 杖 前 去 。 若 遇 见 人 ， 不 要 向 他 问 安 。 人 若 向 你 问 安 ， 也 不 要 回 答 。 要 把 我 的 杖 放 在 孩 子 脸 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thine hand, and go thy way: if thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then he said to Gehazi, Make yourself ready, and take my stick in your hand, and go: if you come across anyone on the way, give him no blessing, and if anyone gives you a blessing, give him no answer. And put my stick on the child's face. 
<br>4:30 [hgb]&nbsp; 孩 子 的 母 亲 说 ， 我 指 着 永 生 的 耶 和 华 ， 又 敢 在 你 面 前 起 誓 ， 我 必 不 离 开 你 。 于 是 以 利 沙 起 身 ， 随 着 她 去 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But the mother of the child said, As the Lord is living and as your soul is living, I will not go back without you. So he got up and went with her. 
<br>4:31 [hgb]&nbsp; 基 哈 西 先 去 ， 把 杖 放 在 孩 子 脸 上 ， 却 没 有 声 音 ， 也 没 有 动 静 。 基 哈 西 就 迎 着 以 利 沙 回 来 ， 告 诉 他 说 ， 孩 子 还 没 有 醒 过 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff upon the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Wherefore he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Gehazi went on before them and put the stick on the child's face; but there was no voice, and no one gave attention. So he went back, and meeting him gave him the news, saying, The child is not awake. 
<br>4:32 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 利 沙 来 到 ， 进 了 屋 子 ， 看 见 孩 子 死 了 ， 放 在 自 己 的 床 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid upon his bed. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when Elisha came into the house he saw the child dead, stretched on his bed. 
<br>4:33 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 就 关 上 门 ， 只 有 自 己 和 孩 子 在 里 面 ， 他 便 祈 祷 耶 和 华 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed unto the LORD. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So he went in, and shutting the door on the two of them, made prayer to the Lord. 
<br>4:34 [hgb]&nbsp; 上 床 伏 在 孩 子 身 上 ， 口 对 口 ， 眼 对 眼 ， 手 对 手 。 既 伏 在 孩 子 身 上 ， 孩 子 的 身 体 就 渐 渐 温 和 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he went up, and lay upon the child, and put his mouth upon his mouth, and his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands: and he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then he got up on the bed, stretching himself out on the child, and put his mouth on the child's mouth, his eyes on his eyes and his hands on his hands; and the child's body became warm. 
<br>4:35 [hgb]&nbsp; 然 后 他 下 来 ， 在 屋 里 来 往 走 了 一 趟 ， 又 上 去 伏 在 孩 子 身 上 ， 孩 子 打 了 七 个 喷 嚏 ， 就 睁 开 眼 睛 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself upon him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then he came back, and after walking once through the house and back, he went up, stretching himself out on the child seven times; and the child's eyes became open. 
<br>4:36 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 利 沙 叫 基 哈 西 说 ， 你 叫 这 书 念 妇 人 来 。 于 是 叫 了 她 来 。 以 利 沙 说 ， 将 你 儿 子 抱 起 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in unto him, he said, Take up thy son. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he gave orders to Gehazi, and said, Send for the Shunammite. And she came in answer to his voice. And he said, Take up your son. 
<br>4:37 [hgb]&nbsp; 妇 人 就 进 来 ， 在 以 利 沙 脚 前 俯 伏 于 地 ， 抱 起 她 儿 子 出 去 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And she came in, and went down on her face to the earth at his feet; then she took her son in her arms and went out. 
<br>4:38 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 利 沙 又 来 到 吉 甲 ， 那 地 正 有 饥 荒 。 先 知 门 徒 坐 在 他 面 前 ， 他 吩 咐 仆 人 说 ， 你 将 大 锅 放 在 火 上 ， 给 先 知 门 徒 熬 汤 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Elisha went back to Gilgal, now there was very little food in the land; and the sons of the prophets were seated before him. And he said to his servant, Put the great pot on the fire, and make soup for the sons of the prophets. 
<br>4:39 [hgb]&nbsp; 有 一 个 人 去 到 田 野 掐 菜 ， 遇 见 一 棵 野 瓜 藤 ， 就 摘 了 一 兜 野 瓜 回 来 ， 切 了 搁 在 熬 汤 的 锅 中 ， 因 为 他 们 不 知 道 是 什 么 东 西 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And one went out into the field to get green plants and saw a vine of the field, and pulling off the fruit of it till the fold of his robe was full, he came back and put the fruit, cut up small, into the pot of soup, having no idea what it was. 
<br>4:40 [hgb]&nbsp; 倒 出 来 给 众 人 吃 ， 吃 的 时 候 ， 都 喊 叫 说 ， 神 人 哪 ， 锅 中 有 致 死 的 毒 物 。 所 以 众 人 不 能 吃 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then they gave the men soup from the pot. And while they were drinking the soup, they gave a cry, and said, O man of God, there is death in the pot; and they were not able to take any more food. 
<br>4:41 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 利 沙 说 ， 拿 点 面 来 ， 就 把 面 撒 在 锅 中 ， 说 ， 倒 出 来 ， 给 众 人 吃 吧 。 锅 中 就 没 有 毒 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But he said, Get some meal. And he put it into the pot, and said, Now give it to the people so that they may have food. And there was nothing bad in the pot. 
<br>4:42 [hgb]&nbsp; 有 一 个 人 从 巴 力 沙 利 沙 来 ， 带 着 初 熟 大 麦 作 的 饼 二 十 个 ， 并 新 穗 子 ， 装 在 口 袋 里 送 给 神 人 。 神 人 说 ， 把 这 些 给 众 人 吃 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give unto the people, that they may eat. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now a man came from Baal-shalishah with an offering of first-fruits for the man of God, twenty barley cakes and garden fruit in his bag. And he said, Give these to the people for food. 
<br>4:43 [hgb]&nbsp; 仆 人 说 ， 这 一 点 岂 可 摆 给 一 百 人 吃 呢 ？ 以 利 沙 说 ， 你 只 管 给 众 人 吃 吧 。 因 为 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 众 人 必 吃 了 ， 还 剩 下 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus saith the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But his servant said, How am I to put this before a hundred men? But he said, Give it to the people for food; for the Lord says, There will be food for them and some over. 
<br>4:44 [hgb]&nbsp; 仆 人 就 摆 在 众 人 面 前 ， 他 们 吃 了 ， 果 然 还 剩 下 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 所 说 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the LORD. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So he put it before them, and they had a meal and there was more than enough, as the Lord had said.
