<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now when Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, saw that her son was dead, she had all the rest of the seed of the kingdom put to death. 
<br>11:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 但 约 兰 王 的 女 儿 ， 亚 哈 谢 的 妹 子 约 示 巴 ， 将 亚 哈 谢 的 儿 子 约 阿 施 从 那 被 杀 的 王 子 中 偷 出 来 ， 把 他 和 他 的 乳 母 都 藏 在 卧 房 里 ， 躲 避 亚 他 利 雅 ， 免 得 被 杀 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of Ahaziah, secretly took Joash, the son of Ahaziah, with the woman who took care of him, away from among the king's sons who were put to death, and put him in the bedroom; and they kept him safe from Athaliah, so that he was not put to death. 
<br>11:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 阿 施 和 他 的 乳 母 藏 在 耶 和 华 的 殿 里 六 年 。 亚 他 利 雅 篡 了 国 位 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And Athaliah did reign over the land. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And for six years she kept him safe in the house of the Lord, while Athaliah was ruling over the land. 
<br>11:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 第 七 年 ， 耶 何 耶 大 打 发 人 叫 迦 利 人 （ 或 作 亲 兵 ） 和 护 卫 兵 的 众 百 夫 长 来 ， 领 他 们 进 了 耶 和 华 的 殿 ， 与 他 们 立 约 ， 使 他 们 在 耶 和 华 殿 里 起 誓 ， 又 将 王 的 儿 子 指 给 他 们 看 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king's son. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then in the seventh year, Jehoiada sent for the captains of hundreds of the Carians, and the armed men, and taking them into the house of the Lord, made an agreement with them, and made them take an oath in the house of the Lord, and let them see the king's son. 
<br>11:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 吩 咐 他 们 说 ， 你 们 当 这 样 行 ， 凡 安 息 日 进 班 的 三 分 之 一 要 看 守 王 宫 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the king's house; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he gave them orders, saying, This is what you are to do: the third part of you, who come in on the Sabbath and keep the watch of the king's house, 
<br>11:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 三 分 之 一 要 在 苏 珥 门 ， 三 分 之 一 要 在 护 卫 兵 院 的 后 门 。 这 样 把 守 王 宫 ， 拦 阻 闲 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house, that it be not broken down. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; ... 
<br>11:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 们 安 息 日 所 有 出 班 的 三 分 之 二 要 在 耶 和 华 的 殿 里 护 卫 王 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the two divisions of you, who go out on the Sabbath and keep the watch of the house of the Lord, 
<br>11:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 各 人 手 拿 兵 器 ， 四 围 护 卫 王 。 凡 擅 入 你 们 班 次 的 必 当 治 死 ， 王 出 入 的 时 候 ， 你 们 当 跟 随 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Will make a circle round the king, every man being armed; and whoever comes inside your lines is to be put to death; keep with the king, when he goes out and when he comes in. 
<br>11:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 众 百 夫 长 就 照 着 祭 司 耶 何 耶 大 一 切 所 吩 咐 的 去 行 ， 各 带 所 管 安 息 日 进 班 出 班 的 人 来 见 祭 司 耶 何 耶 大 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the captains of hundreds did as Jehoiada the priest gave them orders; every one took with him his men, those who came in and those who went out on the Sabbath, and they came in to Jehoiada the priest. 
<br>11:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 祭 司 便 将 耶 和 华 殿 里 所 藏 大 卫 王 的 枪 和 盾 牌 交 给 百 夫 长 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the priest gave to the captains of hundreds the spears and body-covers which had been King David's, and which were kept in the house of the Lord. 
<br>11:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 护 卫 兵 手 中 各 拿 兵 器 ， 在 坛 和 殿 那 里 ， 从 殿 右 直 到 殿 左 ， 站 在 王 子 的 四 围 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the armed men took up their positions, every man with his instruments of war in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left, round about the altar and the house. 
<br>11:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 祭 司 领 王 子 出 来 ， 给 他 戴 上 冠 冕 ， 将 律 法 书 交 给 他 ， 膏 他 作 王 。 众 人 就 拍 掌 说 ， 愿 王 万 岁 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he brought forth the king's son, and put the crown upon him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then he made the king's son come out, and put the crown on him and the arm-bands, and made him king, and put the holy oil on him; and they all, making sounds of joy with their hands, said, Long life to the king. 
<br>11:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 亚 他 利 雅 听 见 护 卫 兵 和 民 的 声 音 ， 就 到 民 那 里 ， 进 耶 和 华 的 殿 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now Athaliah, hearing the noise made by the people, came to the people in the house of the Lord; 
<br>11:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 看 见 王 照 例 站 在 柱 旁 ， 百 夫 长 和 吹 号 的 人 侍 立 在 王 左 右 ， 国 中 的 众 民 欢 乐 吹 号 。 亚 他 利 雅 就 撕 裂 衣 服 ， 喊 叫 说 ， 反 了 。 反 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And looking, she saw the king in his regular place by the pillar, and the captains and the horns near him; and all the people of the land giving signs of joy and sounding the horns. Then Athaliah, violently parting her robes, gave a cry, saying, Broken faith, broken faith! 
<br>11:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 祭 司 耶 何 耶 大 吩 咐 管 辖 军 兵 的 百 夫 长 说 ， 将 她 赶 出 班 外 ， 凡 跟 随 她 的 必 用 刀 杀 死 。 因 为 祭 司 说 不 可 在 耶 和 华 殿 里 杀 她 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds, the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Jehoiada the priest gave orders to those who were placed in authority over the army, saying, Take her outside the lines, and let anyone who goes after her be put to death with the sword, for he said, Let her not be put to death in the house of the Lord. 
<br>11:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 众 兵 就 闪 开 让 她 去 。 她 从 马 路 上 王 宫 去 ， 便 在 那 里 被 杀 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the king's house: and there was she slain. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So they put their hands on her, and she went to the king's house by the doorway of the horses, and there she was put to death. 
<br>11:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 何 耶 大 使 王 和 民 与 耶 和 华 立 约 ， 作 耶 和 华 的 民 。 又 使 王 与 民 立 约 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people, that they should be the LORD's people; between the king also and the people. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Jehoiada made an agreement between the Lord and the king and the people, that they would be the Lord's people; and in the same way between the king and the people. 
<br>11:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 国 民 都 到 巴 力 庙 ， 拆 毁 了 庙 ， 打 碎 坛 和 像 ， 又 在 坛 前 将 巴 力 的 祭 司 玛 坦 杀 了 。 祭 司 耶 何 耶 大 派 官 看 守 耶 和 华 的 殿 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then all the people of the land went to the house of Baal and had it pulled down: its altars and images were all broken to bits, and Mattan, the priest of Baal, they put to death before the altars. And the priest put overseers over the Lord's house. 
<br>11:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 又 率 领 百 夫 长 和 迦 利 人 （ 或 作 亲 兵 ） 与 护 卫 兵 ， 以 及 国 中 的 众 民 ， 请 王 从 耶 和 华 殿 下 来 ， 由 护 卫 兵 的 门 进 入 王 宫 ， 他 就 坐 了 王 位 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house. And he sat on the throne of the kings. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then he took the captains of hundreds, and the Carians, and the armed men, and all the people of the land; and they came down with the king from the house of the Lord, through the doorway of the armed men, to the king's house. And he took his place on the seat of the kings. 
<br>11:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 国 民 都 欢 乐 ， 合 城 都 安 静 。 众 人 已 将 亚 他 利 雅 在 王 宫 那 里 用 刀 杀 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king's house. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So all the people of the land were glad, and the town was quiet; and they had put Athaliah to death with the sword at the king's house. 
<br>11:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 阿 施 登 基 的 时 候 年 方 七 岁 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Jehoash was seven years old when he became king.
