<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the LORD; Thus saith the LORD, To morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Elisha said, Give ear to the word of the Lord: the Lord says, Tomorrow, about this time, a measure of good meal will be offered for the price of a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the market-place of Samaria. 
<br>7:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 有 一 个 搀 扶 王 的 军 长 对 神 人 说 ， 即 便 耶 和 华 使 天 开 了 窗 户 ， 也 不 能 有 这 事 。 以 利 沙 说 ， 你 必 亲 眼 看 见 ， 却 不 得 吃 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God, and said, Behold, if the LORD would make windows in heaven, might this thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the captain whose arm was supporting the king said to the man of God, Even if the Lord made windows in heaven, would such a thing be possible? And he said, Your eyes will see it, but you will not have a taste of the food. 
<br>7:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 在 城 门 那 里 有 四 个 长 大 麻 疯 的 人 ， 他 们 彼 此 说 ， 我 们 为 何 坐 在 这 里 等 死 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate: and they said one to another, Why sit we here until we die? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now there were four lepers seated at the doorway into the town: and they said to one another, Why are we waiting here for death? 
<br>7:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 们 若 说 ， 进 城 去 吧 。 城 里 有 饥 荒 ， 必 死 在 那 里 。 若 在 这 里 坐 着 不 动 ， 也 必 是 死 。 来 吧 ， 我 们 去 投 降 亚 兰 人 的 军 队 ， 他 们 若 留 我 们 的 活 命 ， 就 活 着 。 若 杀 我 们 ， 就 死 了 吧 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians: if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; If we say, We will go into the town, there is no food in the town, and we will come to our end there; and if we go on waiting here, death will come to us. Come then, let us give ourselves up to the army of Aram: if they let us go on living, then life will be ours; and if they put us to death, then death will be ours. 
<br>7:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 黄 昏 的 时 候 ， 他 们 起 来 往 亚 兰 人 的 营 盘 去 。 到 了 营 边 ， 不 见 一 人 在 那 里 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they rose up in the twilight, to go unto the camp of the Syrians: and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So in the half light they got up to go to the tents of Aram; but when they came to the outer line of tents, there was no one there. 
<br>7:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 因 为 主 使 亚 兰 人 的 军 队 听 见 车 马 的 声 音 ， 是 大 军 的 声 音 。 他 们 就 彼 此 说 ， 这 必 是 以 色 列 王 贿 买 赫 人 的 诸 王 和 埃 及 人 的 诸 王 来 攻 击 我 们 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For the Lord had made the sound of carriages and horses, and the noise of a great army, come to the ears of the Aramaeans, so that they said to one another, Truly, the king of Israel has got the kings of the Hittites and of the Egyptians for a price to make an attack on us. 
<br>7:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 所 以 ， 在 黄 昏 的 时 候 他 们 起 来 逃 跑 ， 撇 下 帐 棚 ， 马 ， 驴 ， 营 盘 照 旧 ， 只 顾 逃 命 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, even the camp as it was, and fled for their life. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So they got up and went in flight, in the half light, without their tents or their horses or their asses or any of their goods; they went in flight, fearing for their lives. 
<br>7:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 些 长 大 麻 疯 的 到 了 营 边 ， 进 了 帐 棚 ， 吃 了 喝 了 ， 且 从 其 中 拿 出 金 银 和 衣 服 来 ， 去 收 藏 了 。 回 来 又 进 了 一 座 帐 棚 ， 从 其 中 拿 出 财 物 来 去 收 藏 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent, and did eat and drink, and carried thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid it; and came again, and entered into another tent, and carried thence also, and went and hid it. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when those lepers came to the outer line of tents, they went into one tent, and had food and drink, and took from it silver and gold and clothing, which they put in a secret place; then they came back and went into another tent from which they took more goods, which they put away in a secret place. 
<br>7:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 时 ， 他 们 彼 此 说 ， 我 们 所 作 的 不 好 。 今 日 是 有 好 信 息 的 日 子 ， 我 们 竟 不 作 声 。 若 等 到 天 亮 ， 罪 必 临 到 我 们 。 来 吧 ， 我 们 与 王 家 报 信 去 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then they said one to another, We do not well: this day is a day of good tidings, and we hold our peace: if we tarry till the morning light, some mischief will come upon us: now therefore come, that we may go and tell the king's household. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then they said to one another, We are not doing right. Today is a day of good news, and we say nothing: if we go on waiting here till the morning, punishment will come to us. So let us go and give the news to those of the king's house. 
<br>7:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 就 去 叫 守 城 门 的 ， 告 诉 他 们 说 ， 我 们 到 了 亚 兰 人 的 营 ， 不 见 一 人 在 那 里 ， 也 无 人 声 ， 只 有 拴 着 的 马 和 驴 ， 帐 棚 都 照 旧 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So they came and called unto the porter of the city: and they told them, saying, We came to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied, and asses tied, and the tents as they were. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So they came in, and, crying out to the door-keepers of the town, they gave them the news, saying, We came to the tents of the Aramaeans, and there was no one there and no voice of man, only the horses and the asses in their places, and the tents as they were. 
<br>7:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 守 城 门 的 叫 了 众 守 门 的 人 来 ， 他 们 就 进 去 与 王 家 报 信 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he called the porters; and they told it to the king's house within. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the door-keepers, crying out, gave the news to those inside the king's house. 
<br>7:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 王 夜 间 起 来 ， 对 臣 仆 说 ， 我 告 诉 你 们 亚 兰 人 向 我 们 如 何 行 。 他 们 知 道 我 们 饥 饿 ， 所 以 离 营 ， 埋 伏 在 田 野 ， 说 ， 以 色 列 人 出 城 的 时 候 ， 我 们 就 活 捉 他 们 ， 得 以 进 城 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the king arose in the night, and said unto his servants, I will now shew you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we be hungry; therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the king got up in the night and said to his servants, This is my idea of what the Aramaeans have done to us. They have knowledge that we are without food; and so they have gone out of their tents, and are waiting secretly in the open country, saying, When they come out of the town, we will take them living and get into the town. 
<br>7:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 有 一 个 臣 仆 对 王 说 ， 我 们 不 如 用 城 里 剩 下 之 马 中 的 五 匹 马 （ 马 和 城 里 剩 下 的 以 色 列 人 都 是 一 样 ， 快 要 灭 绝 ） ， 打 发 人 去 窥 探 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And one of his servants answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city, (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, I say, they are even as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed:) and let us send and see. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And one of his servants said in answer, Send men and let them take five of the horses which we still have in the town; if they keep their lives they will be the same as those of Israel who are still living here; if they come to their death they will be the same as all those of Israel who have gone to destruction: let us send and see. 
<br>7:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 取 了 两 辆 车 和 马 ， 王 差 人 去 追 寻 亚 兰 军 ， 说 ， 你 们 去 窥 探 窥 探 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; They took therefore two chariot horses; and the king sent after the host of the Syrians, saying, Go and see. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So they took two horsemen; and the king sent them after the army of the Aramaeans, saying, Go and see. 
<br>7:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 就 追 寻 到 约 旦 河 ， 看 见 满 道 上 都 是 亚 兰 人 急 跑 时 丢 弃 的 衣 服 器 具 ， 使 者 就 回 来 报 告 王 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they went after them unto Jordan: and, lo, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they went after them as far as Jordan; and all the road was covered with clothing and vessels dropped by the Aramaeans in their flight. So those who were sent went back and gave the news to the king. 
<br>7:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 众 人 就 出 去 ， 掳 掠 亚 兰 人 的 营 盘 。 于 是 一 细 亚 细 面 卖 银 一 舍 客 勒 ， 二 细 亚 大 麦 也 卖 银 一 舍 客 勒 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 所 说 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the people went out and took the goods from the tents of the Aramaeans. So a measure of good meal was to be had for the price of a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, as the Lord had said. 
<br>7:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 王 派 搀 扶 他 的 那 军 长 在 城 门 口 弹 压 ， 众 人 在 那 里 将 他 践 踏 ， 他 就 死 了 ， 正 如 神 人 在 王 下 来 见 他 的 时 候 所 说 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate: and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came down to him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the king gave authority to that captain, on whose arm he was supported, to have control over the doorway into the town; but he was crushed to death there under the feet of the people, as the man of God had said when the king went down to him. 
<br>7:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 神 人 曾 对 王 说 ， 明 日 约 到 这 时 候 ， 在 撒 玛 利 亚 城 门 口 ， 二 细 亚 大 麦 要 卖 银 一 舍 客 勒 ， 一 细 亚 细 面 也 要 卖 银 一 舍 客 勒 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel, shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of Samaria: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So the words of the man of God came true, which he said to the king: Two measures of barley will be offered for the price of a shekel and a measure of good meal for a shekel, tomorrow about this time in the market-place of Samaria. 
<br>7:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 那 军 长 对 神 人 说 ， 即 便 耶 和 华 使 天 开 了 窗 户 ， 也 不 能 有 这 事 。 神 人 说 ， 你 必 亲 眼 看 见 ， 却 不 得 吃 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now, behold, if the LORD should make windows in heaven, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eat thereof. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And that captain said to the man of God, Even if the Lord made windows in heaven, would such a thing be possible? And he said to him, Your eyes will see it, but you will not have a taste of the food. 
<br>7:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 话 果 然 应 验 在 他 身 上 。 因 为 众 人 在 城 门 口 将 他 践 踏 ， 他 就 死 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And so it fell out unto him: for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And such was his fate; for he was crushed to death under the feet of the people, in the doorway into the town.
