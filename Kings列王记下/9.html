<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of oil in thine hand, and go to Ramothgilead: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Elisha the prophet sent for one of the sons of the prophets, and said to him, Make yourself ready for a journey, and take this bottle of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead. 
<br>9:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 到 了 那 里 ， 要 寻 找 宁 示 的 孙 子 ， 约 沙 法 的 儿 子 耶 户 ， 使 他 从 同 僚 中 起 来 ， 带 他 进 严 密 的 屋 子 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when you get there, go in search of Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi; and go in and make him get up from among his brothers, and take him to an inner room. 
<br>9:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 将 瓶 里 的 膏 油 倒 在 他 头 上 ， 说 ， 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 我 膏 你 作 以 色 列 王 。 说 完 了 ， 就 开 门 逃 跑 ， 不 要 迟 延 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then take the bottle and put the oil on his head, and say, The Lord says, I have put the holy oil on you to make you king over Israel. Then, opening the door, go in flight, without waiting. 
<br>9:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 那 少 年 先 知 往 基 列 的 拉 末 去 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramothgilead. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So the young prophet went to Ramoth-gilead. 
<br>9:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 到 了 那 里 ， 看 见 众 军 长 都 坐 着 ， 就 说 ， 将 军 哪 ， 我 有 话 对 你 说 。 耶 户 说 ， 我 们 众 人 里 ， 你 要 对 哪 一 个 说 呢 ？ 回 答 说 ， 将 军 哪 ， 我 要 对 你 说 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when he came, he saw the captains of the army seated together; and he said, I have something to say to you, O captain. And Jehu said, To which of us? And he said, To you, O captain. 
<br>9:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 户 就 起 来 ， 进 了 屋 子 ， 少 年 人 将 膏 油 倒 在 他 头 上 ， 对 他 说 ， 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 如 此 说 ， 我 膏 你 作 耶 和 华 民 以 色 列 的 王 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he got up and went into the house; then he put the holy oil on his head and said to him, The Lord, the God of Israel, says, I have made you king over the people of the Lord, over Israel. 
<br>9:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 要 击 杀 你 主 人 亚 哈 的 全 家 ， 我 好 在 耶 洗 别 身 上 伸 我 仆 人 众 先 知 和 耶 和 华 一 切 仆 人 流 血 的 冤 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; You are to see that the family of Ahab your master is cut off, so that I may take from Jezebel payment for the blood of my servants the prophets, and for the blood of all the servants of the Lord. 
<br>9:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 亚 哈 全 家 必 都 灭 亡 ， 凡 属 亚 哈 的 男 丁 ， 无 论 是 困 住 的 ， 自 由 的 ， 我 必 从 以 色 列 中 剪 除 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For the family of Ahab will come to an end; every male of Ahab's family will be cut off, he who is shut up and he who goes free in Israel. 
<br>9:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 使 亚 哈 的 家 像 尼 八 儿 子 耶 罗 波 安 的 家 ， 又 像 亚 希 雅 儿 子 巴 沙 的 家 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; I will make the family of Ahab like that of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and Baasha, the son of Ahijah. 
<br>9:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 洗 别 必 在 耶 斯 列 田 里 被 狗 所 吃 ， 无 人 葬 埋 。 说 完 了 ， 少 年 人 就 开 门 逃 跑 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Jezebel will become food for the dogs in the heritage of Jezreel, and there will be no one to put her body into the earth. Then, opening the door, he went in flight. 
<br>9:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 户 出 来 ， 回 到 他 主 人 的 臣 仆 那 里 ， 有 一 人 问 他 说 ， 平 安 吗 ？ 这 狂 妄 的 人 来 见 你 有 什 么 事 呢 ？ 回 答 说 ， 你 们 认 得 那 人 ， 也 知 道 他 说 什 么 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Jehu came out again to the servants of his lord, and one said to him, Is all well? why did this man, who is off his head, come to you? And he said to them, You have knowledge of the man and of his talk. 
<br>9:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 说 ， 这 是 假 话 ， 你 据 实 地 告 诉 我 们 。 回 答 说 ， 他 如 此 如 此 对 我 说 。 他 说 ， 耶 和 华 如 此 说 ， 我 膏 你 作 以 色 列 王 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they said, That is not true; now give us his story. Then he said, This is what he said to me: The Lord says, I have made you king over Israel. 
<br>9:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 就 急 忙 各 将 自 己 的 衣 服 铺 在 上 层 台 阶 ， 使 耶 户 坐 在 其 上 。 他 们 吹 角 ， 说 ， 耶 户 作 王 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then straight away everyone took his robe and put it under him on the top of the steps, and, sounding the horn, they said, Jehu is king. 
<br>9:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 样 ， 宁 示 的 孙 子 ， 约 沙 法 的 儿 子 耶 户 背 叛 约 兰 。 先 是 约 兰 和 以 色 列 众 人 因 为 亚 兰 王 哈 薛 的 缘 故 ， 把 守 基 列 的 拉 末 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, made designs against Joram. (Now Joram and all the army of Israel were keeping watch on Ramoth-gilead because of Hazael, king of Aram: 
<br>9:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 但 约 兰 王 回 到 耶 斯 列 ， 医 治 与 亚 兰 王 哈 薛 打 仗 所 受 的 伤 。 耶 户 说 ， 若 合 你 们 的 意 思 ， 就 不 容 人 逃 出 城 往 耶 斯 列 报 信 去 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But King Joram had gone back to Jezreel to get well from the wounds which the Aramaeans had given him when he was fighting against Hazael, king of Aram.) And Jehu said, If this is your purpose, then let no one get away and go out of the town to give news of it in Jezreel. 
<br>9:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 耶 户 坐 车 往 耶 斯 列 去 ， 因 为 约 兰 病 卧 在 那 里 。 犹 大 王 亚 哈 谢 已 经 下 去 看 望 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So Jehu got into his carriage and went to Jezreel, for Joram was ill in bed there; and Ahaziah, king of Judah, had come down to see Joram. 
<br>9:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 有 一 个 守 望 的 人 站 在 耶 斯 列 的 楼 上 ， 看 见 耶 户 带 着 一 群 人 来 ， 就 说 ， 我 看 见 一 群 人 。 约 兰 说 ， 打 发 一 个 骑 马 的 去 迎 接 他 们 ， 问 说 ， 平 安 不 平 安 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the watchman on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu and his band coming, and said, I see a band of people. And Joram said, Send out a horseman to them, and let him say, Is it peace? 
<br>9:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 骑 马 的 就 去 迎 接 耶 户 ， 说 ， 王 问 说 ， 平 安 不 平 安 。 耶 户 说 ， 平 安 不 平 安 与 你 何 干 。 你 转 在 我 后 头 吧 。 守 望 的 人 又 说 ， 使 者 到 了 他 们 那 里 ， 却 不 回 来 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he cometh not again. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So a horseman went out to them and said, The king says, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What have you to do with peace? come after me. And the watchman gave them word, saying, The horseman went up to them, but has not come back. 
<br>9:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 王 又 打 发 一 个 骑 马 的 去 。 这 人 到 了 他 们 那 里 ， 说 ， 王 问 说 ， 平 安 不 平 安 。 耶 户 说 ， 平 安 不 平 安 与 你 何 干 。 你 转 在 我 后 头 吧 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then he sent out a second horseman, who came up to them and said, The king says, Is it peace? And Jehu said in answer, What have you to do with peace? come after me. 
<br>9:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 守 望 的 人 又 说 ， 他 到 了 他 们 那 里 ， 也 不 回 来 。 车 赶 得 甚 猛 ， 像 宁 示 的 孙 子 耶 户 的 赶 法 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the watchman gave them word, saying, He went up to them and has not come back again; and the driving is like the driving of Jehu, son of Nimshi, for he is driving violently. 
<br>9:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 兰 吩 咐 说 ， 套 车 。 人 就 给 他 套 车 。 以 色 列 王 约 兰 和 犹 大 王 亚 哈 谢 各 坐 自 己 的 车 出 去 迎 接 耶 户 ， 在 耶 斯 列 人 拿 伯 的 田 那 里 遇 见 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Joram said, Make ready. So they made his carriage ready; and Joram, king of Israel, with Ahaziah, king of Judah, went out in their carriages for the purpose of meeting Jehu; and they came face to face with him at the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. 
<br>9:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 兰 见 耶 户 就 说 ， 耶 户 阿 ， 平 安 吗 ？ 耶 户 说 ， 你 母 亲 耶 洗 别 的 淫 行 邪 术 这 样 多 ， 焉 能 平 安 呢 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now when Joram saw Jehu he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he said in answer, What peace is possible while all the land is full of the disgusting sins of your mother Jezebel, and her secret arts? 
<br>9:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 约 兰 就 转 车 逃 跑 ， 对 亚 哈 谢 说 ， 亚 哈 谢 阿 ， 反 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Joram, turning his horses in flight, said to Ahaziah, Broken faith, O Ahaziah! 
<br>9:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 户 开 满 了 弓 ， 射 中 约 兰 的 脊 背 ， 箭 从 心 窝 穿 出 ， 约 兰 就 仆 倒 在 车 上 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Jehu took his bow in his hand, and with all his strength sent an arrow, wounding Joram between the arms; and the arrow came out at his heart, and he went down on his face in his carriage. 
<br>9:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 户 对 他 的 军 长 毕 甲 说 ， 你 把 他 抛 在 耶 斯 列 人 拿 伯 的 田 间 。 你 当 追 想 ， 你 我 一 同 坐 车 跟 随 他 父 亚 哈 的 时 候 ， 耶 和 华 对 亚 哈 所 说 的 预 言 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden upon him; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then Jehu said to Bidkar, his captain, Take him up, and put him in the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for is not that day in your memory when you and I together on our horses were going after Ahab, his father, and the Lord put this fate on him, saying: 
<br>9:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 说 ， 我 昨 日 看 见 拿 伯 的 血 和 他 众 子 的 血 ， 我 必 在 这 块 田 上 报 应 你 。 这 是 耶 和 华 说 的 ， 现 在 你 要 照 着 耶 和 华 的 话 ， 把 他 抛 在 这 田 间 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; I saw the blood of Naboth and of his sons yesterday; and I will give you full payment in this field, says the Lord? So now, take him and put him in this field, as the Lord said. 
<br>9:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 犹 大 王 亚 哈 谢 见 这 光 景 ， 就 从 园 亭 之 路 逃 跑 。 耶 户 追 赶 他 ， 说 ， 把 这 人 也 杀 在 车 上 。 到 了 靠 近 以 伯 莲 姑 珥 的 坡 上 击 伤 了 他 。 他 逃 到 米 吉 多 ， 就 死 在 那 里 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now when Ahaziah, king of Judah, saw this, he went in flight by the way of the garden house. And Jehu came after him and said, Put him to death in the same way; and they gave him a death-wound in his carriage, on the slope up to Gur, by Ibleam; and he went in flight to Megiddo, where death came to him. 
<br>9:28 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 的 臣 仆 用 车 将 他 的 尸 首 送 到 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 葬 在 大 卫 城 他 自 己 的 坟 墓 里 ， 与 他 列 祖 同 葬 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And his servants took him in a carriage to Jerusalem, and put him into the earth with his fathers in the town of David. 
<br>9:29 [hgb]&nbsp; 亚 哈 谢 登 基 作 犹 大 王 的 时 候 ， 是 在 亚 哈 的 儿 子 约 兰 第 十 一 年 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; (In the eleventh year of the rule of Joram, the son of Ahab, Ahaziah became king over Judah.) 
<br>9:30 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 户 到 了 耶 斯 列 。 耶 洗 别 听 见 就 擦 粉 ， 梳 头 ， 从 窗 户 里 往 外 观 看 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel had news of it; and, painting her eyes and dressing her hair with ornaments, she put her head out of the window. 
<br>9:31 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 户 进 门 的 时 候 ， 耶 洗 别 说 ， 杀 主 人 的 心 利 阿 ， 平 安 吗 ？&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master? 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when Jehu was coming into the town, she said, Is all well, O Zimri, taker of your master's life? 
<br>9:32 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 户 抬 头 向 窗 户 观 看 ， 说 ， 谁 顺 从 我 。 有 两 三 个 太 监 从 窗 户 往 外 看 他 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then, looking up to the window, he said, Who is on my side, who? and two or three unsexed servants put out their heads. 
<br>9:33 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 户 说 ， 把 她 扔 下 来 。 他 们 就 把 她 扔 下 来 。 她 的 血 溅 在 墙 上 和 马 上 。 于 是 把 她 践 踏 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her under foot. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he said, Take her and put her out of the window. So they sent her down with force, and her blood went in a shower on the wall and on the horses; and she was crushed under their feet. 
<br>9:34 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 户 进 去 ， 吃 了 喝 了 ， 吩 咐 说 ， 你 们 把 这 被 咒 诅 的 妇 人 葬 埋 了 ， 因 为 她 是 王 的 女 儿 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king's daughter. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he came in, and took food and drink; then he said, Now see to this cursed woman, and put her body into the earth, for she is a king's daughter. 
<br>9:35 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 就 去 葬 埋 她 ， 只 寻 得 她 的 头 骨 和 脚 ， 并 手 掌 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they went out to put her body into the earth, but nothing of her was to be seen, only the bones of her head, and her feet, and parts of her hands. 
<br>9:36 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 回 去 告 诉 耶 户 ， 耶 户 说 ， 这 正 应 验 耶 和 华 借 他 仆 人 提 斯 比 人 以 利 亚 所 说 的 话 ， 说 ， 在 耶 斯 列 田 间 ， 狗 必 吃 耶 洗 别 的 肉 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So they came back and gave him word of it. And he said, This is what the Lord said by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the heritage of Jezreel the flesh of Jezebel will become food for dogs; 
<br>9:37 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 洗 别 的 尸 首 必 在 耶 斯 列 田 间 如 同 粪 土 ， 甚 至 人 不 能 说 这 是 耶 洗 别 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the dead body of Jezebel will be like waste dropped on the face of the earth in the heritage of Jezreel; so that they will not be able to say, This is Jezebel.
