<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah began Hoshea the son of Elah to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; In the twelfth year of Ahaz, king of Judah, Hoshea, the son of Elah, became king over Israel in Samaria, ruling for nine years. 
<br>17:2 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 只 是 不 像 在 他 以 前 的 以 色 列 诸 王 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; He did evil in the eyes of the Lord, though not like the kings of Israel before him. 
<br>17:3 [hgb]&nbsp; 亚 述 王 撒 缦 以 色 上 来 攻 击 何 细 亚 ， 何 细 亚 就 服 事 他 ， 给 他 进 贡 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Against him came up Shalmaneser king of Assyria; and Hoshea became his servant, and gave him presents. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Against him came up Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, and Hoshea became his servant and sent him offerings. 
<br>17:4 [hgb]&nbsp; 何 细 亚 背 叛 ， 差 人 去 见 埃 及 王 梭 ， 不 照 往 年 所 行 的 与 亚 述 王 进 贡 。 亚 述 王 知 道 了 ， 就 把 他 锁 禁 ， 囚 在 监 里 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hoshea: for he had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: therefore the king of Assyria shut him up, and bound him in prison. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But Hoshea's broken faith became clear to the king of Assyria because he had sent representatives to So, king of Egypt, and did not send his offering to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year: so the king of Assyria had him shut up in prison and put in chains. 
<br>17:5 [hgb]&nbsp; 亚 述 王 上 来 攻 击 以 色 列 遍 地 ， 上 到 撒 玛 利 亚 ， 围 困 三 年 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land, and went up to Samaria, and besieged it three years. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the king of Assyria went through all the land and came up to Samaria, shutting it in with his forces for three years. 
<br>17:6 [hgb]&nbsp; 何 细 亚 第 九 年 亚 述 王 攻 取 了 撒 玛 利 亚 ， 将 以 色 列 人 掳 到 亚 述 ， 把 他 们 安 置 在 哈 腊 与 歌 散 的 哈 博 河 边 ， 并 玛 代 人 的 城 邑 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria took Samaria, and took Israel away to Assyria, placing them in Halah and in Habor on the river Gozan, and in the towns of the Medes. 
<br>17:7 [hgb]&nbsp; 这 是 因 以 色 列 人 得 罪 那 领 他 们 出 埃 及 地 ， 脱 离 埃 及 王 法 老 手 的 耶 和 华 他 们 的 神 ， 去 敬 畏 别 神 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For so it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the LORD their God, which had brought them up out of the land of Egypt, from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the wrath of the Lord came on Israel because they had done evil against the Lord their God, who took them out of the land of Egypt from under the yoke of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and had become worshippers of other gods, 
<br>17:8 [hgb]&nbsp; 随 从 耶 和 华 在 他 们 面 前 所 赶 出 外 邦 人 的 风 俗 和 以 色 列 诸 王 所 立 的 条 规 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And walked in the statutes of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel, and of the kings of Israel, which they had made. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Living by the rules of the nations whom the Lord had sent out from before the children of Israel. 
<br>17:9 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 色 列 人 暗 中 行 不 正 的 事 ， 违 背 耶 和 华 他 们 的 神 ， 在 他 们 所 有 的 城 邑 ， 从 了 望 楼 直 到 坚 固 城 ， 建 筑 丘 坛 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the children of Israel did secretly those things that were not right against the LORD their God, and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the children of Israel did secretly against the Lord their God things which were not right, building high places for themselves in all their towns, from the tower of the watchmen to the walled town. 
<br>17:10 [hgb]&nbsp; 在 各 高 冈 上 ， 各 青 翠 树 下 立 柱 像 和 木 偶 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they set them up images and groves in every high hill, and under every green tree: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; They put up pillars of stone and wood on every high hill and under every green tree: 
<br>17:11 [hgb]&nbsp; 在 丘 坛 上 烧 香 ， 效 法 耶 和 华 在 他 们 面 前 赶 出 的 外 邦 人 所 行 的 ， 又 行 恶 事 惹 动 耶 和 华 的 怒 气 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as did the heathen whom the LORD carried away before them; and wrought wicked things to provoke the LORD to anger: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Burning their offerings in all the high places, as those nations did whom the Lord sent away from before them; they did evil things, moving the Lord to wrath; 
<br>17:12 [hgb]&nbsp; 且 事 奉 偶 像 ， 就 是 耶 和 华 警 戒 他 们 不 可 行 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For they served idols, whereof the LORD had said unto them, Ye shall not do this thing. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they made themselves servants of disgusting things, though the Lord had said, You are not to do this. 
<br>17:13 [hgb]&nbsp; 但 耶 和 华 借 众 先 知 ， 先 见 劝 戒 以 色 列 人 和 犹 大 人 说 ， 当 离 开 你 们 的 恶 行 ， 谨 守 我 的 诫 命 律 例 ， 遵 行 我 吩 咐 你 们 列 祖 ， 并 借 我 仆 人 众 先 知 所 传 给 你 们 的 律 法 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Yet the LORD testified against Israel, and against Judah, by all the prophets, and by all the seers, saying, Turn ye from your evil ways, and keep my commandments and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my servants the prophets. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And he gave witness to Israel and Judah, by every prophet and seer, saying, Come back from your evil ways, and do my orders and keep my rules, and be guided by the law which I gave to your fathers and sent to you by my servants the prophets. 
<br>17:14 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 却 不 听 从 ， 竟 硬 着 颈 项 ， 效 法 他 们 列 祖 ， 不 信 服 耶 和 华 他 们 的 神 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Notwithstanding they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, that did not believe in the LORD their God. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they did not give ear, but became stiff-necked, like their fathers who had no faith in the Lord their God. 
<br>17:15 [hgb]&nbsp; 厌 弃 他 的 律 例 和 他 与 他 们 列 祖 所 立 的 约 ， 并 劝 戒 他 们 的 话 ， 随 从 虚 无 的 神 ， 自 己 成 为 虚 妄 ， 效 法 周 围 的 外 邦 人 ， 就 是 耶 和 华 嘱 咐 他 们 不 可 效 法 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they rejected his statutes, and his covenant that he made with their fathers, and his testimonies which he testified against them; and they followed vanity, and became vain, and went after the heathen that were round about them, concerning whom the LORD had charged them, that they should not do like them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they went against his rules, and the agreement which he made with their fathers, and his laws which he gave them; they gave themselves up to things without sense or value, and became foolish like the nations round them, of whom the Lord had said, Do not as they do. 
<br>17:16 [hgb]&nbsp; 离 弃 耶 和 华 他 们 神 的 一 切 诫 命 ， 为 自 己 铸 了 两 个 牛 犊 的 像 ， 立 了 亚 舍 拉 ， 敬 拜 天 上 的 万 象 ， 事 奉 巴 力 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they left all the commandments of the LORD their God, and made them molten images, even two calves, and made a grove, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served Baal. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And turning their backs on all the orders which the Lord had given them, they made for themselves images of metal, and the image of Asherah, worshipping all the stars of heaven and becoming servants to Baal. 
<br>17:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 又 使 他 们 的 儿 女 经 火 ， 用 占 卜 ， 行 法 术 卖 了 自 己 ， 行 耶 和 华 眼 中 看 为 恶 的 事 ， 惹 动 他 的 怒 气 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments, and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And they made their sons and their daughters go through the fire, and they made use of secret arts and unnatural powers, and gave themselves up to doing evil in the eyes of the Lord, till he was moved to wrath. 
<br>17:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 所 以 耶 和 华 向 以 色 列 人 大 大 发 怒 ， 从 自 己 面 前 赶 出 他 们 ， 只 剩 下 犹 大 一 个 支 派 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So the Lord was very angry with Israel, and his face was turned away from them: only the tribe of Judah kept its place. 
<br>17:19 [hgb]&nbsp; 犹 大 人 也 不 遵 守 耶 和 华 他 们 神 的 诫 命 ， 随 从 以 色 列 人 所 立 的 条 规 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Also Judah kept not the commandments of the LORD their God, but walked in the statutes of Israel which they made. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; (But even Judah did not keep the orders of the Lord their God, but were guided by the rules which Israel had made. 
<br>17:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 和 华 就 厌 弃 以 色 列 全 族 ， 使 他 们 受 苦 ， 把 他 们 交 在 抢 夺 他 们 的 人 手 中 ， 以 致 赶 出 他 们 离 开 自 己 面 前 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the LORD rejected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and delivered them into the hand of spoilers, until he had cast them out of his sight. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So the Lord would have nothing to do with all the offspring of Israel, and sent trouble on them, and gave them up into the hands of their attackers, till he had sent them away from before his face.) 
<br>17:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 将 以 色 列 国 从 大 卫 家 夺 回 。 他 们 就 立 尼 八 的 儿 子 耶 罗 波 安 作 王 。 耶 罗 波 安 引 诱 以 色 列 人 不 随 从 耶 和 华 ， 陷 在 大 罪 里 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For he rent Israel from the house of David; and they made Jeroboam the son of Nebat king: and Jeroboam drave Israel from following the LORD, and made them sin a great sin. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For Israel was broken off from the family of David, and they made Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, king, who, driving them away from the laws of the Lord, made them do a great sin. 
<br>17:22 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 色 列 人 犯 耶 罗 波 安 所 犯 的 一 切 罪 ， 总 不 离 开 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For the children of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they departed not from them; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the children of Israel went on with all the sins which Jeroboam did; they did not keep themselves from them; 
<br>17:23 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 致 耶 和 华 从 自 己 面 前 赶 出 他 们 ， 正 如 借 他 仆 人 众 先 知 所 说 的 。 这 样 ， 以 色 列 人 从 本 地 被 掳 到 亚 述 ， 直 到 今 日 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Until the LORD removed Israel out of his sight, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So was Israel carried away out of their own land to Assyria unto this day. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Till the Lord put Israel away from before his face, as he had said by all his servants the prophets. So Israel was taken away from their land to Assyria, to this day. 
<br>17:24 [hgb]&nbsp; 亚 述 王 从 巴 比 伦 ， 古 他 ， 亚 瓦 ， 哈 马 ， 和 西 法 瓦 音 迁 移 人 来 ， 安 置 在 撒 玛 利 亚 的 城 邑 ， 代 替 以 色 列 人 。 他 们 就 得 了 撒 玛 利 亚 ， 住 在 其 中 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the king of Assyria brought men from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Ava, and from Hamath, and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the children of Israel: and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the king of Assyria took men from Babylon and from Cuthah and Avva and Hamath and Sepharvaim, and put them in the towns of Samaria in place of the children of Israel; so they got Samaria for their heritage, living in its towns. 
<br>17:25 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 才 住 那 里 的 时 候 ， 不 敬 畏 耶 和 华 ， 所 以 耶 和 华 叫 狮 子 进 入 他 们 中 间 ， 咬 死 了 些 人 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, that they feared not the LORD: therefore the LORD sent lions among them, which slew some of them. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Now when first they were living there they did not give worship to the Lord. So the Lord sent lions among them, causing the death of some of them. 
<br>17:26 [hgb]&nbsp; 有 人 告 诉 亚 述 王 说 ， 你 所 迁 移 安 置 在 撒 玛 利 亚 各 城 的 那 些 民 ， 不 知 道 那 地 之 神 的 规 矩 ， 所 以 那 神 叫 狮 子 进 入 他 们 中 间 ， 咬 死 他 们 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast removed, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the manner of the God of the land: therefore he hath sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So they said to the king of Assyria, The nations whom you have taken as prisoners and put in the towns of Samaria, have no knowledge of the way of the god of the land: so he has sent lions among them, causing their death, because they have no knowledge of his way. 
<br>17:27 [hgb]&nbsp; 亚 述 王 就 吩 咐 说 ， 叫 所 掳 来 的 祭 司 回 去 一 个 ， 使 他 住 在 那 里 ， 将 那 地 之 神 的 规 矩 指 教 那 些 民 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence; and let them go and dwell there, and let him teach them the manner of the God of the land. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Then the king of Assyria gave orders, saying, Send there one of the priests whom you took away, and let him be living there and teaching the people the way of the god of the land. 
<br>17:28 [hgb]&nbsp; 于 是 有 一 个 从 撒 玛 利 亚 掳 去 的 祭 司 回 来 ， 住 在 伯 特 利 ， 指 教 他 们 怎 样 敬 畏 耶 和 华 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them how they should fear the LORD. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So one of the priests whom they had taken away as a prisoner from Samaria came back, and, living in Beth-el, became their teacher in the worship of the Lord. 
<br>17:29 [hgb]&nbsp; 然 而 ， 各 族 之 人 在 所 住 的 城 里 各 为 自 己 制 造 神 像 ， 安 置 在 撒 玛 利 亚 人 所 造 有 丘 坛 的 殿 中 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Howbeit every nation made gods of their own, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And every nation made gods for themselves, and put them in the houses of the high places which the Samaritans had made, every nation in the towns where they were living. 
<br>17:30 [hgb]&nbsp; 巴 比 伦 人 造 疏 割 比 讷 像 。 古 他 人 造 匿 甲 像 。 哈 马 人 造 亚 示 玛 像 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima, 
<br>17:31 [hgb]&nbsp; 亚 瓦 人 造 匿 哈 和 他 珥 他 像 。 西 法 瓦 音 人 用 火 焚 烧 儿 女 ， 献 给 西 法 瓦 音 的 神 亚 得 米 勒 和 亚 拿 米 勒 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites gave their children to be burned in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim. 
<br>17:32 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 惧 怕 耶 和 华 ， 也 从 他 们 中 间 立 丘 坛 的 祭 司 ， 为 他 们 在 有 丘 坛 的 殿 中 献 祭 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So they feared the LORD, and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So they went on worshipping the Lord, and made for themselves, from among all the people, priests for the high places, to make offerings for them in the houses of the high places. 
<br>17:33 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 又 惧 怕 耶 和 华 ， 又 事 奉 自 己 的 神 ， 从 何 邦 迁 移 ， 就 随 何 邦 的 风 俗 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; They gave worship to the Lord, but they gave honour to their gods like the nations did from whom they had been taken as prisoners. 
<br>17:34 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 直 到 如 今 仍 照 先 前 的 风 俗 去 行 ， 不 专 心 敬 畏 耶 和 华 ， 不 全 守 自 己 的 规 矩 ， 典 章 ， 也 不 遵 守 耶 和 华 吩 咐 雅 各 后 裔 的 律 法 ， 诫 命 。 雅 各 ， 就 是 从 前 耶 和 华 起 名 叫 以 色 列 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Unto this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So to this day they go on in their old ways, not worshipping the Lord or keeping his orders or his ways or the law and the rule which the Lord gave to the children of Jacob, to whom he gave the name Israel; 
<br>17:35 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 和 华 曾 与 他 们 立 约 ， 嘱 咐 他 们 说 ， 不 可 敬 畏 别 神 ， 不 可 跪 拜 事 奉 他 ， 也 不 可 向 他 献 祭 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; With whom the LORD had made a covenant, and charged them, saying, Ye shall not fear other gods, nor bow yourselves to them, nor serve them, nor sacrifice to them: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the Lord made an agreement with them and gave them orders, saying, You are to have no other gods; you are not to give worship to them or be their servants or make them offerings: 
<br>17:36 [hgb]&nbsp; 但 那 用 大 能 和 伸 出 来 的 膀 臂 领 你 们 出 埃 及 地 的 耶 和 华 ， 你 们 当 敬 畏 ， 跪 拜 ， 向 他 献 祭 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But the LORD, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt with great power and a stretched out arm, him shall ye fear, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye do sacrifice. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But the Lord, who took you out of the land of Egypt with his great power and his outstretched arm, he is your God, to whom you are to give worship and make offerings: 
<br>17:37 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 给 你 们 写 的 律 例 ， 典 章 ， 律 法 ， 诫 命 ， 你 们 应 当 永 远 谨 守 遵 行 ， 不 可 敬 畏 别 神 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the statutes, and the ordinances, and the law, and the commandment, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do for evermore; and ye shall not fear other gods. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the rules and the orders and the law which he put in writing for you, you are to keep and do for ever; you are to have no other gods. 
<br>17:38 [hgb]&nbsp; 我 耶 和 华 与 你 们 所 立 的 约 你 们 不 可 忘 记 ， 也 不 可 敬 畏 别 神 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And you are to keep in memory the agreement which I have made with you; and you are to have no other gods. 
<br>17:39 [hgb]&nbsp; 但 要 敬 畏 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 ， 他 必 救 你 们 脱 离 一 切 仇 敌 的 手 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But the LORD your God ye shall fear; and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And you are to give worship to the Lord your God; for it is he who will give you salvation from the hands of all who are against you. 
<br>17:40 [hgb]&nbsp; 他 们 却 不 听 从 ， 仍 照 先 前 的 风 俗 去 行 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Howbeit they did not hearken, but they did after their former manner. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But they gave no attention, but went on in their old way. 
<br>17:41 [hgb]&nbsp; 如 此 这 些 民 又 惧 怕 耶 和 华 ， 又 事 奉 他 们 的 偶 像 。 他 们 子 子 孙 孙 也 都 照 样 行 ， 效 法 他 们 的 祖 宗 ， 直 到 今 日 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; So these nations feared the LORD, and served their graven images, both their children, and their children's children: as did their fathers, so do they unto this day.
