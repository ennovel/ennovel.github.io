<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And after the holy place and all its vessels have been covered up by Aaron and his sons, when the tents of the people go forward, the sons of Kohath are to come and take it up; but the holy things may not be touched by them for fear of death.

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein is, in the sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, is to be responsible for the oil for the light, and the sweet perfumes for burning, and the regular meal offering, and the holy oil; the House and the holy place and everything in it will be in his care. 
<br>4:17 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 和 华 晓 谕 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 说 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, 
<br>4:18 [hgb]&nbsp; 你 们 不 可 将 哥 辖 人 的 支 派 从 利 未 人 中 剪 除 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites:

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But do this to them, so that life and not death may be theirs when they come near the most holy things; let Aaron and his sons go in and give to every one his work and that which he is to take up; 
<br>4:20 [hgb]&nbsp; 只 是 他 们 连 片 时 不 可 进 去 观 看 圣 所 ， 免 得 他 们 死 亡 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered, lest they die. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But they themselves are not to go in to see the holy place, even for a minute, for fear of death. 
<br>4:21 [hgb]&nbsp; 耶 和 华 晓 谕 摩 西 说 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

<br>4:49 [hgb]&nbsp; 摩 西 按 他 们 所 办 的 事 ， 所 抬 的 物 ， 凭 耶 和 华 的 吩 咐 数 点 他 们 。 他 们 这 样 被 摩 西 数 点 ， 正 如 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 他 的 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; According to the commandment of the LORD they were numbered by the hand of Moses, every one according to his service, and according to his burden: thus were they numbered of him, as the LORD commanded Moses. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; At the order of the Lord they were numbered by Moses, every one in relation to his work and to his part in the transport; so they were numbered by Moses at the order of the Lord.
