<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But the Levites, of the tribe of their fathers, were not numbered among them. 
<br>1:48 [hgb]&nbsp; 因 为 耶 和 华 晓 谕 摩 西 说 ，&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying, 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; For the Lord said to Moses, 
<br>1:49 [hgb]&nbsp; 惟 独 利 未 支 派 你 不 可 数 点 ， 也 不 可 在 以 色 列 人 中 计 算 他 们 的 总 数 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel: 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; Only the tribe of Levi is not to be numbered among the children of Israel, 
<br>1:50 [hgb]&nbsp; 只 要 派 利 未 人 管 法 柜 的 帐 幕 和 其 中 的 器 具 ， 并 属 乎 帐 幕 的 。 他 们 要 抬 （ 抬 或 作 搬 运 ） 帐 幕 和 其 中 的 器 具 ， 并 要 办 理 帐 幕 的 事 ， 在 帐 幕 的 四 围 安 营 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But to them you are to give the care of the Tent of meeting with its vessels and everything in it: they are to take up the Tent, and be responsible for everything to do with it, and put up their tents round it. 
<br>1:51 [hgb]&nbsp; 帐 幕 将 往 前 行 的 时 候 ， 利 未 人 要 拆 卸 。 将 支 搭 的 时 候 ， 利 未 人 要 竖 起 。 近 前 来 的 外 人 必 被 治 死 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; And when the Tent of meeting goes forward, the Levites are to take it down; and when it is to be put up, they are to do it: any strange person who comes near it is to be put to death. 
<br>1:52 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 色 列 人 支 搭 帐 棚 ， 要 照 他 们 的 军 队 ， 各 归 本 营 ， 各 归 本 纛 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; The children of Israel are to put up their tents, every man in his tent-circle round his flag. 
<br>1:53 [hgb]&nbsp; 但 利 未 人 要 在 法 柜 帐 幕 的 四 围 安 营 ， 免 得 忿 怒 临 到 以 色 列 会 众 。 利 未 人 并 要 谨 守 法 柜 的 帐 幕 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; But the tents of the Levites are to be round the Tent of meeting, so that wrath may not come on the children of Israel: the Tent of meeting is to be in the care of the Levites. 
<br>1:54 [hgb]&nbsp; 以 色 列 人 就 这 样 行 。 凡 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 摩 西 的 ， 他 们 就 照 样 行 了 。&nbsp; 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [kjv]&nbsp; And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they. 
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [bbe]&nbsp; So the children of Israel did as the Lord had given orders to Moses.
