<br> The Earl of Chesterfield, Letters to His SonThe great burrow was less crowded than when they had left it. Nildro-hain wasthe first rabbit they met. She was among a group of three or four fine does whowere talking quietly together and seemed to be feeding as well. There was a smellof greenstuff. Evidently some kind of food was available underground, like theThrearah's lettuce. Hazel stopped to speak to Nildro-hain. She asked whether hehad gone as far as the well pit and the El-ahrairah of Laburnum.
<br> "Yes, we did," said Hazel. "It's something quite strange to me, I'm afraid. ButI'd rather admire you and your friends than stones on a wall."As he said this, he noticed that Cowslip had joined them and that Strawberrywas talking to him quietly. He caught the words "never been near a Shape" and amoment later Cowslip replied, "Well, it makes no difference from our point ofview."Hazel suddenly felt tired and depressed. He heard Blackberry behind Cowslip'ssleek, heavy shoulder and went across to him.
<br> "Come out into the grass," he said quietly. "Bring anyone else who'll come."At that moment Cowslip turned to him and said, "You'll be glad of somethingto eat now. I'll show you what we've got down here.""One or two of us are just going to silflay,"* said Hazel.
<br> "Oh, it's still raining much too hard for that," said Cowslip, as though therecould be no two ways about it. "We'll feed you here.""I should be sorry to quarrel over it," said Hazel firmly, "but some of us need tosilflay. We're used to it, and rain doesn't bother us."Cowslip seemed taken aback for a moment Then he laughed.
<br> The phenomenon of laughter is unknown to animals; though it is possible thatdogs and elephants may have some inkling of it. The effect on Hazel andBlackberry was overwhelming. Hazel's first idea was that Cowslip was showingthe symptom of some kind of disease. Blackberry clearly thought that he might begoing to attack them and backed away. Cowslip said nothing, but his eerielaughter continued. Hazel and Blackberry turned and scuttled up the nearest runas though he had been a ferret. Halfway up they met Pipkin, who was smallenough first to let them pass and then to turn round and follow them.
<br> The rain was still falling steadily. The night was dark and, for May, cold. Theyall three hunched themselves in the grass and nibbled while the rain ran off theirfur in streams.
<br> "My goodness, Hazel," said Blackberry, "did you really want to silflay? This isterrible! I was just going to eat whatever it is they have and then go to sleep.
<br> What's the idea?""I don't know," replied Hazel. "I suddenly felt I had to get out and I wantedyour company. I can see what's troubling Fiver; though he'll get over it, I dare say.
<br> There is something strange about these rabbits. Do you know they push stonesinto the wall?""They do what?"Hazel explained. Blackberry was as much at a loss as he had been himself. "ButI'll tell you another thing," he said. "Bigwig wasn't so far wrong. They do sing likethe birds. I was in a burrow belonging to a rabbit called Betony. His doe has alitter and she was making a noise over them rather like a robin in autumn. Tosend them to sleep, she said. It made me feel queer, I can tell you.""And what do you think of them, Hlao-roo?" asked Hazel.
<br> "They're very nice and kind," answered Pipkin, "but I'll tell you how they strikeme. They all seem terribly sad. I can't think why, when they're so big and strongand have this beautiful warren. But they put me in mind of trees in November. Iexpect I'm being silly, though, Hazel. You brought us here and I'm sure it must bea fine, safe place.""No, you're not being silly. I hadn't realized it, but you're perfectly right. Theyall seem to have something on their minds.""But after all," said Blackberry, "we don't know why they're so few. They don'tfill the warren, anything like. Perhaps they've had some sort of trouble that's leftthem sad.""We don't know because they don't tell us. But if we're going to stay here we'vegot to learn to get on with them. We can't fight them: they're too big. And wedon't want them fighting us.""I don't believe they can fight, Hazel," said Pipkin. "Although they're so big,they don't seem like fighters to me. Not like Bigwig and Silver.""You notice a lot, don't you, Hlao-roo?" said Hazel. "Do you notice it's rainingharder than ever? I've got enough grass in my stomach for a bit. We'll go downagain now, but let's keep to ourselves for a while.""Why not sleep?" said Blackberry. "It's over a night and a day now and I'mdropping."They returned down a different hole and soon found a dry, empty burrow,where they curled up together and slept in the warmth of their own tired bodies.
<br> When Hazel woke he perceived at once that it was morning -- some time aftersunrise, by the smell of it. The scent of apple blossom was plain enough. Then hepicked up the fainter smells of buttercups and horses. Mingled with these cameanother. Although it made him uneasy, he could not tell for some moments whatit was. A dangerous smell, an unpleasant smell, a totally unnatural smell -- quiteclose outside: a smoke smell -- something was burning. Then he rememberedhow Bigwig, after his reconnaissance on the previous day, had spoken of the littlewhite sticks in the grass. That was it. A man had been walking over the groundoutside. That must have been what had awakened him.
<br> Hazel lay in the warm, dark burrow with a delightful sense of security. Hecould smell the man. The man could not smell him. All the man could smell wasthe nasty smoke he was making. He fell to thinking of the Shape in the well pit,and then dropped into a drowsy half-dream, in which El-ahrairah said that it wasall a trick of his to disguise himself as Poison Tree and put the stones in the wall,to engage Strawberry's attention while he himself was getting acquainted withNildro-hain.
<br> Pipkin stirred and turned in his sleep, murmuring, "Sayn lay narn, Marli?" ("Isgroundsel nice, Mother?") and Hazel, touched to think that he must be dreamingof old days, rolled over on his side to give him room to settle again. At thatmoment, however, he heard a rabbit approaching down some run close by.
<br> Whoever it was, he was calling -- and stamping as well, Hazel noticed -- in anunnatural way. The sound, as Blackberry had said, was not unlike birdsong. As hecame closer, Hazel could distinguish the word.
<br> "Flayrah! Flayrah!"The voice was Strawberry's. Pipkin and Blackberry were waking, more at thestamping than the voice, which was thin and novel, not striking through theirsleep to any deep instinct. Hazel slipped out of the burrow into the run and atonce came upon Strawberry busily thumping a hind leg on the hard earth floor.
<br> "My mother used to say, 'If you were a horse the ceiling would fall down,'" saidHazel. "Why do you stamp underground?""To wake everyone," answered Strawberry. "The rain went on nearly all night,you know. We generally sleep right through the early morning if it's roughweather. But it's turned fine now.""Why actually wake everybody, though?""Well, the man's gone by and Cowslip and I thought the flayrah ought not to lieabout for long. If we don't go and get it the rats and rooks come and I don't likefighting rats. I expect it's all in the day's work to an adventurous lot like you.""I don't understand,""Well, come along with me. I'm just going back along this run for Nildro-hain.
<br> We haven't got a litter at present, you see, so she'll come out with the rest of us."Other rabbits were making their way along the run and Strawberry spoke toseveral of them, more than once remarking that he would enjoy taking their newfriends across the field. Hazel began to realize that he liked Strawberry. On theprevious day he had been too tired and bewildered to size him up. But now thathe had had a good sleep, he could see that Strawberry was really a harmless,decent sort of fellow. He was touchingly devoted to the beautiful Nildro-hain; andhe evidently had moods of gaiety and a great capacity for enjoyment. As theycame up into the May morning he hopped over the ditch and skipped into thelong grass as blithe as a squirrel. He seemed quite to have lost the preoccupied airthat had troubled Hazel the night before. Hazel himself paused in the mouth ofthe hole, as he always had behind the bramble curtain at home, and looked outacross the valley.
<br> The sun, risen behind the copse, threw long shadows from the treessouthwestward across the field. The wet grass glittered and nearby a nut treesparkled iridescent, winking and gleaming as its branches moved in the lightwind. The brook was swollen and Hazel's ears could distinguish the deeper,smoother sound, changed since the day before. Between the copse and the brook,the slope was covered with pale lilac lady's-smocks, each standing separately inthe grass, a frail stalk of bloom above a spread of cressy leaves. The breezedropped and the little valley lay completely still, held in long beams of light andenclosed on either side by the lines of the woods. Upon this clear stillness, likefeathers on the surface of a pool, fell the calling of a cuckoo.
<br> "It's quite safe, Hazel," said Cowslip behind him in the hole. "I know you'reused to taking a good look round when you silflay, but here we generally gostraight out."Hazel did not mean to alter his ways or take instructions from Cowslip.
<br> However, no one had pushed him and there was no point in bickering over trifles.
<br> He hopped across the ditch to the further bank and looked round him again.
<br> Several rabbits were already running down the field toward a distant hedgedappled white with great patches of maybloom. He saw Bigwig and Silver andwent to join them, flicking the wet off his front paws step by step, like a cat.
<br> "I hope your friends have been looking after you as well as these fellows havelooked after us, Hazel," said Bigwig. "Silver and I really feel at home again. If youask me, I reckon we've all made a big change for the better. Even if Fiver's wrongand nothing terrible has happened back at the old warren, I'd still say we're betteroff here. Are you coming along to feed?""What is this business about going to feed, do you know?" asked Hazel.
<br> "Haven't they told you? Apparently there's flayrah to be had down the fields.
<br> Most of them go every day."(Rabbits usually eat grass, as everyone knows. But more appetizing food -- e.g.,lettuce or carrots, for which they will make an expedition or rob a garden -- isflayrah.)"Flayrah? But isn't it rather late in the morning to raid a garden?" said Hazel,glancing at the distant roofs of the farm behind the trees.
<br> "No, no," said one of the warren rabbits, who had overheard him. "Theflayrah's left in the field, usually near the place where the brook rises. We eithereat it there or bring it back -- or both. But we'll have to bring some back today.
<br> The rain was so bad last night that no one went out and we ate almost everythingin the warren."The brook ran through the hedgerow, and there was a cattle wade in the gap.
<br> After the rain the edges were a swamp, with water standing in every hoofprint.
<br> The rabbits gave them a wide berth and came through by another gap further up,close to the gnarled trunk of an old crab-apple tree. Beyond, surrounding athicket of rushes, stood an enclosure of posts and rails half as high as a man.
<br> Inside it, the kingcups bloomed and the brook whelmed up from its source.
<br> On the pasture nearby Hazel could see scattered, russet-and-orange-coloredfragments, some with feathery light green foliage showing up against the darkergrass. They gave off a pungent, horsy smell, as if freshly cut. It attracted him. Hebegan to salivate and stopped to pass hraka. Cowslip, coming up nearby, turnedtoward him with his unnatural smile. But now Hazel, in his eagerness, paid noattention. Powerfully drawn, he ran out of the hedgerow toward the scatteredground. He came to one of the fragments, sniffed it and tasted it. It was carrot.
<br> Hazel had eaten various roots in his life, but only once before had he tastedcarrot, when a cart horse had spilled a nose bag near the home warren. Thesewere old carrots, some half eaten already by mice or fly. But to the rabbits theywere redolent with luxury, a feast to drive all other feelings out of mind. Hazel satnibbling and biting, the rich, full taste of the cultivated roots filling him with awave of pleasure. He hopped about the grass, gnawing one piece after another,eating the green tops along with the slices. No one interrupted him. There seemedto be plenty for all. From time to time, instinctively, he looked up and sniffed thewind, but his caution was half-hearted. "If elil come, let them," he thought. "I'llfight the lot. I couldn't run, anyway. What a country! What a warren! No wonderthey're all as big as hares and smell like princes!" "Hello, Pipkin! Fill yourself upto the ears! No more shivering on the banks of streams for you, old chap!""He won't know how to shiver in a week or two," said Hawkbit, with his mouthfull. "I feel so much better for this! I'd follow you anywhere, Hazel. I wasn'tmyself in the heather that night. It's bad when you know you can't getunderground. I hope you understand.""It's all forgotten," answered Hazel. "I'd better ask Cowslip what we'resupposed to do about taking some of this stuff back to the warren."He found Cowslip near the spring. He had evidently finished feeding and waswashing his face with his front paws.
<br> "Are there roots here every day?" asked Hazel. "Where--" He checked himselfjust in time. "I'm learning," he thought.
<br> "Not always roots," replied Cowslip. "These are last year's, as you'll havenoticed. I suppose the remains are being cleared out. It may be anything -- roots,greenstuff, old apples: it all depends. Sometimes there's nothing at all, especiallyin good summer weather. But in hard weather, in winter, there's nearly alwayssomething. Big roots, usually, or kale, or sometimes corn. We eat that too, youknow.""Food's no problem, then. The whole place ought to be full of rabbits. Isuppose--""If you really have finished," interrupted Cowslip, "--and there's no hurry; dotake your time -- you could try carrying. It's easy with these roots -- easier thananything except lettuce. You simply bite onto one, take it back to the warren andput it in the great burrow. I generally take two at a time, but then I've had a lot ofpractice. Rabbits don't usually carry food, I know, but you'll learn. It's useful tohave a store. The does need some for their young when they're getting bigger; andit's particularly convenient for all of us in bad weather. Come back with me andI'll help if you find the carrying difficult at first."It took Hazel some trouble to learn to grip half a carrot in his mouth and carryit, like a dog, across the field and back to the warren. He had to put it downseveral times. But Cowslip was encouraging and he was determined to keep uphis position as the resourceful leader of the newcomers. At his suggestion theyboth waited at the mouth of one of the larger holes to see how his companionswere shaping. They all seemed to be making an effort and doing their best,although the smaller rabbits -- especially Pipkin -- clearly found the task anawkward one.
<br> "Cheer up, Pipkin," said Hazel. "Think how much you'll enjoy eating it tonight.
<br> Anyway, I'm sure Fiver must find it as hard as you: he's just as small.""I don't know where he is," said Pipkin. "Have you seen him?"Now that Hazel thought about it, he had not. He became a little anxious and,as he returned across the field with Cowslip, did his best to explain something ofFiver's peculiar temperament. "I do hope he's all right," he said. "I think perhapsI'll go and look for him when we've carried this next lot. Have you any idea wherehe might be?"He waited for Cowslip to reply, but he was disappointed. After a few momentsCowslip said, "Look, do you see those jackdaws hanging round the carrots?
<br> They've been a nuisance for several days now. I must get someone to try to keepthem off until we've finished carrying. But they're really too big for a rabbit totackle. Now, sparrows--""What's that got to do with Fiver?" asked Hazel sharply.
<br> "In fact," said Cowslip, breaking into a run, "I'll go myself."But he did not engage the jackdaws and Hazel saw him pick up another carrotand start back with it. Annoyed, he joined Buckthorn and Dandelion and thethree of them returned together. As they came up to the warren bank he suddenlycaught sight of Fiver. He was sitting half concealed under the low spread of a yewtree on the edge of the copse, some way from the holes of the warren. Puttingdown his carrot, Hazel ran across, scrambled up the bank and joined him on thebare ground under the low, close boughs. Fiver said nothing and continued tostare over the field.
<br> "Aren't you coming to learn to carry, Fiver?" asked Hazel at length. "It's not toodifficult once you get the hang of it.""I'll have nothing to do with it," answered Fiver in a low voice. "Dogs -- you'relike dogs carrying sticks.""Fiver! Are you trying to make me angry? I'm not going to get angry becauseyou call me stupid names. But you're letting the others do all the work.""I'm the one who ought to get angry," said Fiver. "But I'm no good at it, that'sthe trouble. Why should they listen to me? Half of them think I'm mad. You're toblame, Hazel, because you know I'm not and still you won't listen.""So you don't like this warren any better even now? Well, I think you're wrong.
<br> Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. Why shouldn't you make a mistake, likeeverybody else? Hawkbit was wrong in the heather and you're wrong now.""Those are rabbits down there, trotting along like a lot of squirrels with nuts.
<br> How can that be right?""Well, I'd say they've copied a good idea from the squirrels and that makesthem better rabbits.""Do you suppose the man, whoever he is, puts the roots out there because hehas a kind heart? What's he up to?""He's just throwing away rubbish. How many rabbits have had a good meal offmen's rubbish heaps? Shot lettuces, old turnips? You know we all do, when wecan. It's not poisoned, Fiver, I can tell you that. And if he wanted to shoot rabbitshe's had plenty of chances this morning. But he hasn't done it."Fiver seemed to grow even smaller as he flattened himself on the hard earth.
<br> "I'm a fool to try to argue," he said miserably. "Hazel -- dear old Hazel -- it'ssimply that I know there's something unnatural and evil twisted all round thisplace. I don't know what it is, so no wonder I can't talk about it. I keep gettingnear it, though. You know how you poke your nose against wire netting and pushit up against an apple tree, but you still can't bite the bark because of the wire. I'mclose to this -- whatever it is -- but I can't grip it. If I sit here alone I may reach ityet.""Fiver, why not do as I say? Have a meal on those roots and then gounderground and sleep. You'll feel all the better for it.""I tell you I'll have nothing to do with the place," said Fiver. "As for goingunderground, I'd rather go back over the heather. The roof of that hall is made ofbones.""No, no -- tree roots. But, after all, you were underground all night.""I wasn't," said Fiver.
<br> "What? Where were you, then?""Here.""All night?""Yes. A yew tree gives good shelter, you know."Hazel was now seriously worried. If Fiver's horrors had kept him above groundall night in the rain, oblivious of cold and prowling elil, then clearly it was notgoing to be easy to talk him out of them. He was silent for some time. At last hesaid, "What a shame! I still think you'd do better to come and join us. But I'll letyou alone now and come and see how you're feeling later. Don't go eating the yewtree, either."Fiver made no reply and Hazel went back to the field.
<br> The day was certainly not one to encourage foreboding. By ni-Frith it was sohot that the lower part of the field was humid. The air was heavy with thick,herbal smells, as though it were already late June; the water mint and marjoram,not yet flowering, gave off scent from their leaves and here and there an earlymeadowsweet stood in bloom. The chiffchaff was busy all morning, high in asilver birch near the abandoned holes across the dip; and from deep in the copse,somewhere by the disused well, came the beautiful song of the blackcap. By earlyafternoon there was a stillness of heat, and a herd of cows from the higher fieldsslowly grazed their way down into the shade. Only a few of the rabbits remainedabove ground. Almost all were asleep in the burrows. But still Fiver sat aloneunder the yew tree.
<br> In the early evening Hazel sought out Bigwig and together they ventured intothe copse behind the warren. At first they moved cautiously, but before long theygrew confident at finding no trace of any creature larger than a mouse.
<br> "There's nothing to smell," said Bigwig, "and no tracks. I think Cowslip's toldus no more than the truth. There really aren't any elil here. Different from thatwood where we crossed the river. I don't mind telling you, Hazel, I was scaredstiff that night, but I wasn't going to show it.""So was I," answered Hazel. "But I agree with you about this place. It seemscompletely clear. If we--""This is odd, though," interrupted Bigwig. He was in a clump of brambles, inthe middle of which was a rabbit hole that led up from one of the warren passagesbelow. The ground was soft and damp, with old leaves thick in the mold. WhereBigwig had stopped there were signs of commotion. The rotten leaves had beenthrown up in showers. Some were hanging on the brambles and a few flat, wetclots were lying well out in open ground beyond the clump. In the center theearth had been laid bare and was scored with long scratches and furrows, andthere was a narrow, regular hole, about the same size as one of the carrots theyhad carried that morning. The two rabbits sniffed and stared, but could makenothing of it.
<br> "The funny thing is there's no smell," said Bigwig.
<br> "No -- only rabbit, and that's everywhere, of course. And man -- that'severywhere, too. But that smell might very well have nothing to do with it. All ittells us is that a man walked through the wood and threw a white stick down. Itwasn't a man that tore up this ground.""Well, these mad rabbits probably dance in the moonlight or something.""I wouldn't be surprised," said Hazel. "It would be just like them. Let's askCowslip.""That's the only silly thing you've said so far. Tell me, since we came here hasCowslip answered any question you've asked him?""Well, no -- not many.""Try asking him where he dances in the moonlight. Say 'Cowslip, where--'""Oh, you've noticed that, too, have you? He won't answer 'Where' anything.
<br> Neither will Strawberry. I think they may be nervous of us. Pipkin was right whenhe said they weren't fighters. So they're keeping up a mystery to stay even with us.
<br> It's best just to put up with it. We don't want to upset them and it's bound tosmooth itself out in time.""There's more rain coming tonight," said Bigwig. "Soon, too, I think. Let's gounderground and see if we can get them to talk a bit more freely.""I think that's something we can only wait for. But I agree about goingunderground now. And for goodness' sake let's get Fiver to come with us. Hetroubles me. Do you know he was out all night in the rain?"As they went back through the copse Hazel recounted his talk with Fiver thatmorning. They found him under the yew tree and after a rather stormy scene,during which Bigwig grew rough and impatient, he was bullied rather thanpersuaded into going down with them into the great burrow.
<br> It was crowded, and as the rain began to fall more rabbits came down the runs.
<br> They pushed about, cheerful and chattering. The carrots which had been broughtin were eaten between friends or carried away to does and families in burrows allover the warren. But when they were finished the hall remained full. It waspleasantly warm with the heat of so many bodies. Gradually the talkative groupssettled into a contented silence, but no one seemed disposed to go to sleep.
<br> Rabbits are lively at nightfall, and when evening rain drives them undergroundthey still feel gregarious. Hazel noticed that almost all his companions seemed tohave become friendly with the warren rabbits. Also, he found that whenever hemoved into one group or another, the warren rabbits evidently knew who he wasand treated him as the leader of the newcomers. He could not find Strawberry,but after a time Cowslip came up to him from the other end of the hall.
<br> "I'm glad you're here, Hazel," he said. "Some of our lot are suggesting a storyfrom somebody. We're hoping one of your people would like to tell one, but wecan begin ourselves, if you'd prefer."There is a rabbit saying, "In the warren, more stories than passages"; and arabbit can no more refuse to tell a story than an Irishman can refuse to fight.
<br> Hazel and his friends conferred. After a short time Blackberry announced, "We'veasked Hazel to tell you about our adventures: how we made our journey here andhad the good luck to join you."There was an uncomfortable silence, broken only by shuffling and whispering.
<br> Blackberry, dismayed, turned back to Hazel and Bigwig.
<br> "What's the matter?" he asked in a low voice. "Surely there's no harm in that?""Wait," replied Hazel quietly. "Let them tell us if they don't like it. They havetheir own ways here."However, the silence continued for some time, as though the other rabbits didnot care to mention what they thought was wrong.
<br> "It's no good," said Blackberry at last. "You'll have to say something yourself,Hazel. No, why should you? I'll do it." He spoke up again. "On second thoughts,Hazel remembers that we have a good storyteller among us. Dandelion will tellyou a story of El-ahrairah. That can't go wrong, anyway," he whispered.
<br> "Which one, though?" said Dandelion.
<br> Hazel remembered the stones by the well pit. "The King's Lettuce," heanswered. "They think a lot of that, I believe."Dandelion took up his cue with the same plucky readiness that he had shownin the wood. "I'll tell the story of the King's Lettuce," he said aloud.
<br> "We shall enjoy that," replied Cowslip immediately.
<br> "He'd better," muttered Bigwig.
<br> Dandelion began.
<br> *Go above ground to feed.
