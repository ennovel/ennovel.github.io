<br> Napoleon BonaparteAs Dandelion ended, Acorn, who was on the windward side of the little group,suddenly started and sat back, with ears up and nostrils twitching. The strange,rank smell was stronger than ever and after a few moments they all heard a heavymovement close by. Suddenly, on the other side of the path, the fern parted andthere looked out a long, dog-like head, striped black and white. It was pointeddownward, the jaws grinning, the muzzle close to the ground. Behind, they couldjust discern great, powerful paws and a shaggy black body. The eyes were peeringat them, full of savage cunning. The head moved slowly, taking in the duskylengths of the wood ride in both directions, and then fixed them once more withits fierce, terrible stare. The jaws opened wider and they could see the teeth,glimmering white as the stripes along the head. For long moments it gazed andthe rabbits remained motionless, staring back without a sound. Then Bigwig, whowas nearest to the path, turned and slipped back among the others.
<br> "A lendri," he muttered as he passed through them. "It may be dangerous andit may not, but I'm taking no chances with it. Let's get away."They followed him through the fern and very soon came upon another, parallelpath. Bigwig turned into it and broke into a run. Dandelion overtook him and thetwo disappeared among the ilex trees. Hazel and the others followed as best theycould, with Pipkin limping and staggering behind, his fear driving him on in spiteof the pain in his paw.
<br> Hazel came out on the further side of the ilexes and followed the path round abend. Then he stopped dead and sat back on his haunches. Immediately in frontof him, Bigwig and Dandelion were staring out from the sheer edge of a highbank, and below the bank ran a stream. It was in fact the little river Enborne,twelve to fifteen feet wide and at this time of year two or three feet deep withspring rain, but to the rabbits it seemed immense, such a river as they had neverimagined. The moon had almost set and the night was now dark, but they couldsee the water faintly shining as it flowed and could just make out, on the furtherside, a thin belt of nut trees and alders. Somewhere beyond, a plover called threeor four times and was silent.
<br> One by one, most of the others came up, stopped at the bank and looked at thewater without speaking. A chilly breeze was moving and several of them trembledwhere they sat.
<br> "Well, this is a nice surprise, Hazel," said Bigwig at length. "Or were youexpecting this when you took us into the wood?"Hazel realized wearily that Bigwig was probably going to be troublesome. Hewas certainly no coward, but he was likely to remain steady only as long as hecould see his way clear and be sure of what to do. To him, perplexity was worsethan danger; and when he was perplexed he usually grew angry. The day before,Fiver's warning had troubled him, and he had spoken in anger to the Threarahand left the Owsla. Then, while he was in an uncertain mood about the idea ofleaving the warren, Captain Holly had appeared in capital time to be attacked andto provide a perfect reason for their departure. Now, at the sight of the river,Bigwig's assurance was leaking again and unless he, Hazel, could restore it insome way, they were likely to be in for trouble. He thought of the Threarah andhis wily courtesy.
<br> "I don't know what we should have done without you just now, Bigwig," hesaid. "What was that animal? Would it have killed us?""A lendri," said Bigwig. "I've heard about them in the Owsla. They're not reallydangerous. They can't catch a rabbit that runs, and nearly always you can smellthem coming. They're funny things: I've heard of rabbits living almost on top ofthem and coming to no harm. But they're best avoided, all the same. They'll digout rabbit kittens and they'll kill an injured rabbit if they find one. They're one ofthe Thousand, all right. I ought to have guessed from the smell, but it was new tome.""It had killed before it met us," said Blackberry with a shudder. "I saw theblood on its lips.""A rat, perhaps, or pheasant chicks. Lucky for us it had killed, otherwise itmight have been quicker. Still, fortunately we did the right thing. We really cameout of it very well," said Bigwig.
<br> Fiver came limping down the path with Pipkin. They, too, checked and staredat the sight of the river.
<br> "What do you think we ought to do now, Fiver?" asked Hazel.
<br> Fiver looked down at the water and twitched his ears.
<br> "We shall have to cross it," he said. "But I don't think I can swim, Hazel. I'mworn out, and Pipkin's a good deal worse than I am.""Cross it?" cried Bigwig. "Cross it? Who's going to cross it? What do you wantto cross it for? I never heard such nonsense."Like all wild animals, rabbits can swim if they have to; and some even swimwhen it suits them. Rabbits have been known to live on the edge of a wood andregularly swim a brook to feed in the fields beyond. But most rabbits avoidswimming, and certainly an exhausted rabbit could not swim the Enborne.
<br> "I don't want to jump in there," said Speedwell.
<br> "Why not just go along the bank?" asked Hawkbit.
<br> Hazel suspected that if Fiver felt they ought to cross the river, it might bedangerous not to. But how were the others to be persuaded? At this moment, ashe was still wondering what to say to them, he suddenly realized that somethinghad lightened his spirits. What could it be? A smell? A sound? Then he knew.
<br> Nearby, across the river, a lark had begun to twitter and climb. It was morning. Ablackbird called one or two deep, slow notes and was followed by a wood pigeon.
<br> Soon they were in a gray twilight and could see that the stream bordered thefurther edge of the wood. On the other side lay open fields.
