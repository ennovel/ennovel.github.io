<br> R.M. Lockley, The Private Life of the RabbitTo come to the end of a time of anxiety and fear! To feel the cloud that hungover us lift and disperse -- the cloud that dulled the heart and made happiness nomore than a memory! This at least is one joy that must have been known byalmost every living creature.
<br> Here is a boy who was waiting to be punished. But then, unexpectedly, he findsthat his fault has been overlooked or forgiven and at once the world reappears inbrilliant colors, full of delightful prospects. Here is a soldier who was waiting,with a heavy heart, to suffer and die in battle. But suddenly the luck has changed.
<br> There is news! The war is over and everyone bursts out singing! He will go homeafter all! The sparrows in the plowland were crouching in terror of the kestrel.
<br> But she has gone; and they fly pell-mell up the hedgerow, frisking, chattering andperching where they will. The bitter winter had all the country in its grip. Thehares on the down, stupid and torpid with cold, were resigned to sinking furtherand further into the freezing heart of snow and silence. But now -- who wouldhave dreamed it? -- the thaw is trickling, the great tit is ringing his bell from thetop of a bare lime tree, the earth is scented; and the hares bound and skip in thewarm wind. Hopelessness and reluctance are blown away like a fog and the dumbsolitude where they crept, a place desolate as a crack in the ground, opens like arose and stretches to the hills and the sky.
<br> The tired rabbits fed and basked in the sunny meadow as though they hadcome no further than from the bank at the edge of the nearby copse. The heatherand the stumbling darkness were forgotten as though the sunrise had meltedthem. Bigwig and Hawkbit chased each other through the long grass. Speedwelljumped over the little brook that ran down the middle of the field and whenAcorn tried to follow him and fell short, Silver joked with him as he scrambledout and rolled him in a patch of dead oak leaves until he was dry. As the sun rosehigher, shortening the shadows and drawing the dew from the grass, most of therabbits came wandering back to the sun-flecked shade among the cow parsleyalong the edge of the ditch. Here, Hazel and Fiver were sitting with Dandelionunder a flowering wild cherry. The white petals spun down around them,covering the grass and speckling their fur, while thirty feet above a thrush sang,"Cherry dew, cherry dew. Knee deep, knee deep, knee deep.""Well, this is the place all right, isn't it, Hazel?" said Dandelion lazily. "Isuppose we'd better start having a look along the banks soon, although I must sayI'm in no particular hurry. But I've got an idea it may be going to rain beforemuch longer."Fiver looked as though he were about to speak, but then shook his ears andturned to nibbling at a dandelion.
<br> "That looks a good bank, along the edge of the trees up there," answered Hazel.
<br> "What do you say, Fiver? Shall we go up there now or shall we wait a bit longer?"Fiver hesitated and then replied, "Just as you think, Hazel.""Well, there's no need to do any serious digging, is there?" said Bigwig. "Thatsort of thing's all right for does, but not for us.""Still, we'd better make one or two scrapes, don't you think?" said Hazel.
<br> "Something to give us shelter at a pinch. Let's go up to the copse and look round.
<br> We might as well take our time and make quite sure where we'd like to havethem. We don't want to have to do the work twice.""Yes, that's the style," said Bigwig. "And while you're doing that, I'll take Silverand Buckthorn here and have a run down the fields beyond, just to get the lie ofthe land and make sure there isn't anything dangerous."The three explorers set off beside the brook, while Hazel led the other rabbitsacross the field and up to the edge of the woodland. They went slowly along thefoot of the bank, pushing in and out of the clumps of red campion and raggedrobin. From time to time one or another would begin to scrape in the gravellybank, or venture a little way in among the trees and nut bushes to scuffle in theleaf mold. After they had been searching and moving on quietly for some time,they reached a place from which they could see that the field below thembroadened out. Both on their own side and opposite, the wood edges curvedoutward, away from the brook. They also noticed the roofs of a farm, but somedistance off. Hazel stopped and they gathered round him.
<br> "I don't think it makes much difference where we do a bit of scratching," hesaid. "It's all good, so far as I can see. Not the slightest trace of elil -- no scent ortracks or droppings. That seems unusual, but it may be just that the home warrenattracted more elil than other places. Anyway, we ought to do well here. Now I'lltell you what seems the right thing to me. Let's go back a little way, between thewoods, and have a scratch near that oak tree there -- just by that white patch ofstitchwort. I know the farm's a long way off, but there's no point in being nearerto it than we need. And if we're fairly close to the wood opposite, the trees willhelp to break the wind a bit in winter.""Splendid," said Blackberry. "It's going to cloud over, do you see? Rain beforesunset and we'll be in shelter. Well, let's make a start. Oh, look! There's Bigwigcoming back along the bottom, and the other two with him."The three rabbits were returning down the bank of the stream and had not yetseen Hazel and the others. They passed below them, into the narrower part of thefield between the two copses, and it was not until Acorn had been sent halfwaydown the slope to attract their attention that they turned and came up to theditch.
<br> "I don't think there's going to be much to trouble us here, Hazel," said Bigwig.
<br> "The farm's a good way away and the fields between don't show any signs of elil atall. There's a man track -- in fact, there are several -- and they look as though theywere used a good deal. Scent's fresh and there are the ends of those little whitesticks that they burn in their mouths. But that's all for the best, I reckon. We keepaway from the men and the men frighten the elil away.""Why do the men come, do you suppose?" asked Fiver.
<br> "Who knows why men do anything? They may drive cows or sheep in thefields, or cut wood in the copses. What does it matter? I'd rather dodge a manthan a stoat or a fox.""Well, that's fine," said Hazel. "You've found out a lot, Bigwig, and all to thegood. We were just going to make some scrapes along the bank there. We'd betterstart. The rain won't be long now, if I know anything about it."Buck rabbits on their own seldom or never go in for serious digging. This is thenatural job of a doe making a home for her litter before they are born, and thenher buck helps her. All the same, solitary bucks -- if they can find no existingholes to make use of -- will sometimes scratch out short tunnels for shelter,although it is not work that they tackle at all seriously. During the morning thedigging proceeded in a light-hearted and intermittent way. The bank on each sideof the oak tree was bare and consisted of a light, gravelly soil. There were severalfalse starts and fresh choices, but by ni-Frith they had three scrapes of a sort.
<br> Hazel, watching, lent help here and there and encouraged the others. Every sooften he slipped back to look out over the field and make sure that all was safe.
<br> Only Fiver remained solitary. He took no part in the digging but squatted on theedge of the ditch, fidgeting backward and forward, sometimes nibbling and thenstarting up suddenly as though he could hear some sound in the wood. Afterspeaking to him once or twice and receiving no reply, Hazel thought it best to lethim alone. The next time he left the digging he kept away from Fiver and satlooking at the bank, as though entirely concerned with the work.
<br> A little while after ni-Frith the sky clouded over thickly. The light grew dull andthey could smell rain approaching from the west. The blue tit that had beenswinging on a bramble, singing "Heigh ho, go-and-get-another-bit-of-moss,"stopped his acrobatics and flew into the wood. Hazel was just wondering whetherit would be worthwhile starting a side passage to link Bigwig's hole toDandelion's, when he felt a stamp of warning from somewhere close by. Heturned quickly. It was Fiver who had stamped and he was now staring intentlyacross the field.
<br> Beside a tussock of grass a little way outside the opposite copse, a rabbit wassitting and gazing at them. Its ears were erect and it was evidently giving them thefull attention of sight, smell and hearing. Hazel rose on his hind legs, paused, andthen sat back on his haunches, in full view. The other rabbit remained motionless.
<br> Hazel, never taking his eyes off it, heard three or four of the others coming upbehind him. After a moment he said,"Blackberry?""He's down the hole," replied Pipkin.
<br> "Go and get him."Still the strange rabbit made no move. The wind rose and the long grass beganto flutter and ripple in the dip between them. From behind, Blackberry said,"You wanted me, Hazel?""I'm going over to speak to that rabbit," said Hazel. "I want you to come withme.""Can I come?" asked Pipkin.
<br> "No, Hlao-roo. We don't want to frighten him. Three's too many.""Be careful," said Buckthorn, as Hazel and Blackberry set off down the slope.
<br> "He may not be the only one."At several points the brook was narrow -- not much wider than a rabbit run.
<br> They jumped it and went up the opposite slope.
<br> "Just behave as if we were back at home," said Hazel. "I don't see how it can bea trap, and anyway we can always run."As they approached, the other rabbit kept still and watched them intently.
<br> They could see now that he was a big fellow, sleek and handsome. His fur shoneand his claws and teeth were in perfect condition. Nevertheless, he did not seemaggressive. On the contrary, there was a curious, rather unnatural gentlenessabout the way in which he waited for them to come nearer. They stopped andlooked at him from a little distance.
<br> "I don't think he's dangerous," whispered Blackberry. "I'll go up to him first ifyou like.""We'll both go," replied Hazel. But at this moment the other rabbit cametoward them of his own accord. He and Hazel touched their noses together,sniffing and questioning silently. The stranger had an unusual smell, but it wascertainly not unpleasant. It gave Hazel an impression of good feeding, of healthand of a certain indolence, as though the other came from some rich, prosperouscountry where he himself had never been. He had the air of an aristocrat and ashe turned to gaze at Blackberry from his great brown eyes, Hazel began to seehimself as a ragged wanderer, leader of a gang of vagabonds. He had not meant tobe the first to speak, but something in the other's silence compelled him.
<br> "We've come over the heather," he said.
<br> The other rabbit made no reply, but his look was not that of an enemy. Hisdemeanor had a kind of melancholy which was perplexing.
<br> "Do you live here?" asked Hazel, after a pause.
<br> "Yes," replied the other rabbit; and then added, "We saw you come.""We mean to live here, too," said Hazel firmly.
<br> The other rabbit showed no concern. He paused and then answered, "Whynot? We supposed you would. But I don't think there are enough of you, arethere, to live very comfortably on your own?"Hazel felt puzzled. Apparently the stranger was not worried by the news thatthey meant to stay. How big was his warren? Where was it? How many rabbitswere concealed in the copse and watching them now? Were they likely to beattacked? The stranger's manner told nothing. He seemed detached, almostbored, but perfectly friendly. His lassitude, his great size and beautiful, well-groomed appearance, his unhurried air of having all he wanted and of beingunaffected by the newcomers one way or the other -- all these presented Hazelwith a problem unlike anything he had had to deal with before. If there was somekind of trick, he had no idea what it might be. He decided that he himself, at anyrate, would be perfectly candid and plain.
<br> "There are enough of us to protect ourselves," he said. "We don't want to makeenemies, but if we meet with any kind of interference--"The other interrupted smoothly. "Don't get upset -- you're all very welcome. Ifyou're going back now, I'll come over with you; that is, unless you have anyobjection."He set off down the slope. Hazel and Blackberry, after looking at each other fora moment, caught him up and went beside him. He moved easily, without hasteand showed less caution than they in crossing the field. Hazel felt more mystifiedthan ever. The other rabbit evidently had no fear that they might set upon him,hrair to one, and kill him. He was ready to go alone among a crowd of suspiciousstrangers, but what he stood to gain from this risk it was impossible to guess.
<br> Perhaps, thought Hazel wryly, teeth and claws would make no impression on thatgreat, firm body and shining pelt.
<br> When they reached the ditch, all the other rabbits were squatting together,watching their approach. Hazel stopped in front of them but did not know whatto say. If the stranger had not been there, he would have given them an account ofwhat had happened. If Blackberry and he had driven the stranger across the fieldby force, he could have handed him over for safekeeping to Bigwig or Silver. Butto have him sitting beside him, looking his followers over in silence andcourteously waiting for someone else to speak first -- this was a situation beyondHazel's experience. It was Bigwig, straightforward and blunt as always, who brokethe tension.
<br> "Who is this, Hazel?" he said. "Why has he come back with you?""I don't know," answered Hazel, trying to look frank and feeling foolish. "Hecame of his own accord.""Well, we'd better ask him, then," said Bigwig, with something like a sneer. Hecame close to the stranger and sniffed, as Hazel had done. He, too, was evidentlyaffected by the peculiar smell of prosperity, for he paused as though inuncertainty. Then, with a rough, abrupt air, he said, "Who are you and what doyou want?""My name is Cowslip," said the other. "I don't want anything. I hear you'vecome a long way.""Perhaps we have," said Bigwig. "We know how to defend ourselves, too.""I'm sure you do," said Cowslip, looking round at the mud-stained, bedraggledrabbits with an air of being too polite to comment. "But it can be hard to defendoneself against the weather. There's going to be rain and I don't think yourscrapes are finished." He looked at Bigwig, as though waiting for him to askanother question. Bigwig seemed confused. Clearly, he could make no more of thesituation than Hazel. There was silence except for the sound of the rising wind.
<br> Above them, the branches of the oak tree were beginning to creak and sway.
<br> Suddenly, Fiver came forward.
<br> "We don't understand you," he said. "It's best to say so and try to get thingsclear. Can we trust you? Are there many other rabbits here? Those are the thingswe want to know."Cowslip showed no more concern at Fiver's tense manner than he had atanything that had gone before. He drew a forepaw down the back of one ear andthen replied,"I think you're puzzling yourselves unnecessarily. But if you want the answersto your questions, then I'd say yes, you can trust us: we don't want to drive youaway. And there is a warren here, but not as big a one as we should like. Whyshould we want to hurt you? There's plenty of grass, surely?"In spite of his strange, clouded manner, he spoke so reasonably that Hazel feltrather ashamed.
<br> "We've been through a lot of danger," he said. "Everything new seems likedanger to us. After all, you might be afraid that we were coming to take your doesor turn you out of your holes."Cowslip listened gravely. Then he answered,"Well, as to holes, that was something I thought I might mention. Thesescrapes aren't very deep or comfortable, are they? And although they're facing outof the wind now, you ought to know that this isn't the usual wind we get here. It'sblowing up this rain from the south. We usually have a west wind and it'll gostraight into these holes. There are plenty of empty burrows in our warren and ifyou want to come across you'll be welcome. And now if you'll excuse me, I won'tstay any longer. I hate the rain. The warren is round the corner of the woodopposite."He ran down the slope and over the brook. They watched him leap the bank ofthe further copse and disappear through the green bracken. The first scatters ofrain were beginning to fall, pattering into the oak leaves and pricking the barepink skin inside their ears.
<br> "Fine, big fellow, isn't he?" said Buckthorn. "He doesn't look as though he hadmuch to bother about, living here.""What should we do, Hazel, do you think?" asked Silver. "It's true what he said,isn't it? These scrapes -- well, we can crouch in them out of the weather, but nomore than that. And as we can't all get into one, we shall have to split up.""We'll join them together," said Hazel, "and while we're doing that I'd like totalk about what he said. Fiver, Bigwig and Blackberry, can you come with me?
<br> The rest of you split how you like."The new hole was short, narrow and rough. There was no room for two rabbitsto pass. Four were like beans in a pod. For the first time, Hazel began to realizehow much they had left behind. The holes and tunnels of an old warren becomesmooth, reassuring and comfortable with use. There are no snags or roughcorners. Every length smells of rabbit -- of that great, indestructible flood ofRabbitry in which each one is carried along, sure-footed and safe. The heavy workhas all been done by countless great-grandmothers and their mates. All the faultshave been put right and everything in use is of proved value. The rain drainseasily and even the wind of midwinter cannot penetrate the deeper burrows. Notone of Hazel's rabbits had ever played any part in real digging. The work they haddone that morning was trifling and all they had to show for it was rough shelterand little comfort.
<br> There is nothing like bad weather to reveal the shortcomings of a dwelling,particularly if it is too small. You are, as they say, stuck with it and have leisure tofeel all its peculiar irritations and discomforts. Bigwig, with his usual briskenergy, set to work. Hazel, however, returned and sat pensive at the lip of thehole, looking out at the silent, rippling veils of rain that drifted across and acrossthe little valley between the two copses. Closer, before his nose, every blade ofgrass, every bracken frond was bent, dripping and glistening. The smell of lastyear's oak leaves filled the air. It had turned chilly. Across the field the bloom ofthe cherry tree under which they had sat that morning hung sodden and spoiled.
<br> While Hazel gazed, the wind slowly veered round into the west, as Cowslip hadsaid it would, and brought the rain driving into the mouth of the hole. He backeddown and rejoined the others. The pattering and whispering of the rain soundedsoftly but distinctly outside. The fields and woods were shut in under it, emptiedand subdued. The insect life of the leaves and grass was stilled. The thrush shouldhave been singing, but Hazel could hear no thrush. He and his companions were amuddy handful of scratchers, crouching in a narrow, drafty pit in lonely country.
<br> They were not out of the weather. They were waiting, uncomfortably, for theweather to change.
<br> "Blackberry," said Hazel, "what did you think of our visitor and how would youlike to go to his warren?""Well," replied Blackberry, "what I think is this. There's no way of finding outwhether he's to be trusted except to try it. He seemed friendly. But then, if a lot ofrabbits were afraid of some newcomers and wanted to deceive them -- get themdown a hole and attack them -- they'd start -- wouldn't they? -- by sendingsomeone who was plausible. They might want to kill us. But then again, as hesaid, there's plenty of grass and as for turning them out or taking their does, ifthey're all up to his size and weight they've nothing to fear from a crowd like us.
<br> They must have seen us come. We were tired. Surely that was the time to attackus? Or while we were separated, before we began digging? But they didn't. Ireckon they're more likely to be friendly than otherwise. There's only one thingbeats me. What do they stand to get from asking us to join their warren?""Fools attract elil by being easy prey," said Bigwig, cleaning the mud out of hiswhiskers and blowing through his long front teeth. "And we're fools until we'velearned to live here. Safer to teach us, perhaps. I don't know -- give it up. But I'mnot afraid to go and find out. If they do try any tricks, they'll find I know a few aswell. I wouldn't mind taking a chance, to sleep somewhere more comfortable thanthis. We haven't slept since yesterday afternoon.""Fiver?""I think we ought to have nothing to do with that rabbit or his warren. Weought to leave this place at once. But what's the good of talking?"Cold and damp, Hazel felt impatient. He had always been accustomed to relyon Fiver and now, when he really needed him, he was letting them down.
<br> Blackberry's reasoning had been first-rate and Bigwig had at least shown whichway any sound-hearted rabbit would be likely to lean. Apparently the onlycontribution Fiver could make was this beetle-spirited vaporing. He tried toremember that Fiver was undersized and that they had had an anxious time andwere all weary. At this moment the soil at the far end of the burrow began tocrumble inward, then it fell away and Silver's head and front paws appeared.
<br> "Here we are," said Silver cheerfully. "We've done what you wanted, Hazel, andBuckthorn's through next door. But what I'd like to know is, how about What's-His-Name? Cowpat -- no -- Cowslip? Are we going to his warren or not? Surelywe're not going to sit cowering in this place because we're frightened to go andsee him. Whatever will he think of us?""I'll tell you," said Dandelion, from over his shoulder. "If he's not honest, he'llknow we're afraid to come; and if he is, he'll think we're suspicious, cowardlyskulkers. If we're going to live in these fields, we'll have to get on terms with hislot sooner or later, and it goes against the grain to hang about and admit wedaren't visit them.""I don't know how many of them there are," said Silver, "but we're quite acrowd. Anyhow, I hate the idea of just keeping away. How long have rabbits beenelil? Old Cowslip wasn't afraid to come into the middle of us, was he?""Very well," said Hazel. "That's how I feel myself. I just wanted to knowwhether you did. Would you like Bigwig and me to go over there first, byourselves, and report back?""No," said Silver. "Let's all go. If we're going at all, for Frith's sake let's do it asthough we weren't afraid. What do you say, Dandelion?""I think you're right.""Then we'll go now," said Hazel. "Get the others and follow me."Outside, in the thickening light of the late afternoon, with the rain tricklinginto his eyes and under his scut, he watched them as they joined him. Blackberry,alert and intelligent, looking first up and then down the ditch before he crossed it.
<br> Bigwig, cheerful at the prospect of action. The steady, reliable Silver. Dandelion,the dashing storyteller, so eager to be off that he jumped the ditch and ran a littleway into the field before stopping to wait for the rest. Buckthorn, perhaps themost sensible and staunch of them all. Pipkin, who looked round for Hazel andthen came over to wait beside him. Acorn, Hawkbit and Speedwell, decentenough rank-and-filers as long as they were not pushed beyond their limits. Lastof all came Fiver, dejected and reluctant as a sparrow in the frost. As Hazel turnedfrom the hole, the clouds in the west broke slightly and there was a sudden dazzleof watery, pale gold light.
<br> "O El-ahrairah!" thought Hazel. "These are rabbits we're going to meet. Youknow them as well as you know us. Let it be the right thing that I'm doing.""Now, brace up, Fiver!" he said aloud. "We're waiting for you, and gettingwetter every moment."A soaking bumblebee crawled over a thistle bloom, vibrated its wings for a fewseconds and then flew away down the field. Hazel followed, leaving a dark trackbehind him over the silvered grass.
