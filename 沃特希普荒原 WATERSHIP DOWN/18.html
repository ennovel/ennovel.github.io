The Shining Wire</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      When the green field comes off like a lidRevealing what was much better hid,Unpleasant;And look! Behind, without a soundThe woods have come up and are standing roundIn deadly crescent.
<br> And the bolt is sliding in its groove,Outside the window is the black remover's van,And now with sudden, swift emergenceCome the women in dark glasses, the hump-backed surgeonsAnd the scissor-man.
<br> W.H. Auden, The WitnessesIt was cold, it was cold and the roof was made of bones. The roof was made ofthe interlaced sprays of the yew tree, stiff twigs twisted in and out, over andunder, hard as ice and set with dull red berries. "Come on, Hazel," said Cowslip.
<br> "We're going to carry the yew berries home in our mouths and eat them in thegreat burrow. Your friends must learn to do that if they want to go our way." "No!
<br> No!" cried Fiver. "Hazel, no!" But then came Bigwig, twisting in and out of thebranches, his mouth full of berries. "Look," said Bigwig, "I can do it. I'm runninganother way. Ask me where, Hazel! Ask me where! Ask me where!" Then theywere running another way, running, not to the warren but over the fields in thecold, and Bigwig dropped the berries -- blood-red drops, red droppings hard aswire. "It's no good," he said. "No good biting them. They're cold."Hazel woke. He was in the burrow. He shivered. Why was there no warmth ofrabbit bodies lying close together? Where was Fiver? He sat up. Nearby, Bigwigwas stirring and twitching in his sleep, searching for warmth, trying to pressagainst another rabbit's body no longer there. The shallow hollow in the sandyfloor where Fiver had lain was not quite cold: but Fiver was gone.
<br> "Fiver!" said Hazel in the dark.
<br> As soon as he had spoken he knew there would be no reply. He pushed Bigwigwith his nose, butting urgently. "Bigwig! Fiver's gone! Bigwig!"Bigwig was wide awake on the instant and Hazel had never felt so glad of hissturdy readiness.
<br> "What did you say? What's wrong?""Fiver's gone.""Where's he gone?""Silf -- outside. It can only be silf. You know he wouldn't go wandering about inthe warren. He hates it.""He's a nuisance, isn't he? He's left this burrow cold, too. You think he's indanger, don't you? You want to go and look for him?""Yes, I must. He's upset and overwrought and it's not light yet. There may beelil, whatever Strawberry says."Bigwig listened and sniffed for a few moments.
<br> "It's very nearly light," he said. "There'll be light enough to find him by. Well,I'd better come with you, I suppose. Don't worry -- he can't have gone far. But bythe King's Lettuce! I won't half give him a piece of my mind when we catch him.""I'll hold him down while you kick him, if only we can find him. Come on!"They went up the run to the mouth of the hole and paused together. "Since ourfriends aren't here to push us," said Bigwig, "we may as well make sure the placeisn't crawling with stoats and owls before we go out."At that moment a brown owl's call sounded from the opposite wood. It was thefirst call, and by instinct they both crouched motionless, counting four heartbeatsuntil the second followed.
<br> "It's moving away," said Hazel.
<br> "How many field mice say that every night, I wonder? You know the call'sdeceptive. It's meant to be.""Well, I can't help it," said Hazel. "Fiver's somewhere out there and I'm goingafter him. You were right, anyway. It is light -- just.""Shall we look under the yew tree first?"But Fiver was not under the yew tree. The light, as it grew, began to show theupper field, while the distant hedge and brook remained dark, linear shapesbelow. Bigwig jumped down from the bank into the field and ran in a long curveacross the wet grass. He stopped almost opposite the hole by which they hadcome up, and Hazel joined him.
<br> "Here's his line, all right," said Bigwig. "Fresh, too. From the hole straightdown toward the brook. He won't be far away."When raindrops are lying it is easy to see where grass has recently beencrossed. They followed the line down the field and reached the hedge beside thecarrot ground and the source of the brook. Bigwig had been right when he saidthe line was fresh. As soon as they had come through the hedge they saw Fiver.
<br> He was feeding, alone. A few fragments of carrot were still lying about near thespring, but he had left these untouched and was eating the grass not far from thegnarled crab-apple tree. They approached and he looked up.
<br> Hazel said nothing and began to feed beside him. He was now regretting thathe had brought Bigwig. In the darkness before morning and the first shock ofdiscovering that Fiver was gone, Bigwig had been a comfort and a stand-by. Butnow, as he saw Fiver, small and familiar, incapable of hurting anyone or ofconcealing what he felt, trembling in the wet grass, either from fear or from cold,his anger melted away. He felt only sorry for him and sure that, if they could stayalone together for a while, Fiver would come round to an easier state of mind. Butit was probably too late to persuade Bigwig to be gentle: he could only hope forthe best.
<br> Contrary to his fears, however, Bigwig remained as silent as himself. Evidentlyhe had been expecting Hazel to speak first and was somewhat at a loss. For sometime all three moved on quietly over the grass, while the shadows grew strongerand the wood pigeons clattered among the distant trees. Hazel was beginning tofeel that all would be well and that Bigwig had more sense than he had given himcredit for, when Fiver sat up on his hind legs, cleaned his face with his paws andthen, for the first time, looked directly at him.
<br> "I'm going now," he said. "I feel very sad. I'd like to wish you well, Hazel, butthere's no good to wish you in this place. So just goodbye.""But where are you going, Fiver?""Away. To the hills, if I can get there.""By yourself, alone? You can't. You'd die.""You wouldn't have a hope, old chap," said Bigwig. "Something would get youbefore ni-Frith.""No," said Fiver very quietly. "You are closer to death than I.""Are you trying to frighten me, you miserable little lump of chatteringchickweed?" cried Bigwig. "I've a good mind--""Wait, Bigwig," said Hazel. "Don't speak roughly to him.""Why, you said yourself--" began Bigwig.
<br> "I know. But I feel differently now. I'm sorry, Bigwig. I was going to ask you tohelp me to make him come back to the warren. But now -- well, I've always foundthat there was something in what Fiver had to say. For the last two days I'verefused to listen to him and I still think he's out of his senses. But I haven't theheart to drive him back to the warren. I really believe that for some reason orother the place is frightening him out of his wits. I'll go with him a little way andperhaps we can talk. I can't ask you to risk it, too. Anyway, the others ought toknow what we're doing and they won't unless you go and tell them. I'll be backbefore ni-Frith. I hope we both shall."Bigwig stared. Then he turned furiously on Fiver. "You wretched little blackbeetle," he said. "You've never learned to obey orders, have you? It's me, me, meall the time. 'Oh, I've got a funny feeling in my toe, so we must all go and stand onour heads!' And now we've found a fine warren and got into it without evenhaving to fight, you've got to do your best to upset everyone! And then you riskthe life of one of the best rabbits we've got, just to play nursey while you gowandering about like a moonstruck field mouse. Well, I'm finished with you, I'lltell you plain. And now I'm going back to the warren to make sure everyone elseis finished with you as well. And they will be -- don't make any mistake aboutthat."He turned and dashed back through the nearest gap in the hedge. On theinstant, a fearful commotion began on the farther side. There were sounds ofkicking and plunging. A stick flew into the air. Then a flat, wet clod of dead leavesshot clean through the gap and landed clear of the hedge, close to Hazel. Thebrambles thrashed up and down. Hazel and Fiver stared at each other, bothfighting against the impulse to run. What enemy was at work on the other side ofthe hedge? There were no cries -- no spitting of a cat, no squealing of a rabbit --only the crackling of twigs and the tearing of the grass in violence.
<br> By an effort of courage against all instinct, Hazel forced himself forward intothe gap, with Fiver following. A terrible sight lay before them. The rotten leaveshad been thrown up in showers. The earth had been laid bare and was scoredwith long scratches and furrows. Bigwig was lying on his side, his back legskicking and struggling. A length of twisted copper wire, gleaming dully in the firstsunlight, was looped round his neck and ran taut across one forepaw to the headof a stout peg driven into the ground. The running knot had pulled tight and wasburied in the fur behind his ear. The projecting point of one strand had laceratedhis neck and drops of blood, dark and red as yew berries, welled one by one downhis shoulder. For a few moments he lay panting, his side heaving in exhaustion.
<br> Then again began the struggling and fighting, backward and forward, jerking andfalling, until he choked and lay quiet.
<br> Frenzied with distress, Hazel leaped out of the gap and squatted beside him.
<br> Bigwig's eyes were closed and his lips pulled back from the long front teeth in afixed snarl. He had bitten his lower lip and from this, too, the blood was running.
<br> Froth covered his jaws and chest"Thlayli!" said Hazel, stamping. "Thlayli! Listen! You're in a snare -- a snare!
<br> What did they say in the Owsla? Come on -- think. How can we help you?"There was a pause. Then Bigwig's back legs began to kick once more, butfeebly. His ears drooped. His eyes opened unseeing and the whites showedbloodshot as the brown irises rolled one way and the other. After a moment hisvoice came thick and low, bubbling out of the bloody spume in his mouth.
<br> "Owsla -- no good -- biting wire. Peg -- got to -- dig out."A convulsion shook him and he scrabbled at the ground, covering himself in amask of wet earth and blood. Then he was still again.
<br> "Run, Fiver, run to the warren," cried Hazel. "Get the others -- Blackberry,Silver. Be quick! He'll die."Fiver was off up the field like a hare. Hazel, left alone, tried to understand whatwas needed. What was the peg? How was he to dig it out? He looked down at thefoul mess before him. Bigwig was lying across the wire, which came out under hisbelly and seemed to disappear into the ground. Hazel struggled with his ownincomprehension. Bigwig had said, "Dig." That at least he understood. He beganto scratch into the soft earth beside the body, until after a time his claws scrapedagainst something smooth and firm. As he paused, perplexed, he foundBlackberry at his shoulder.
<br> "Bigwig just spoke," he said to him, "but I don't think he can now. He said, 'Digout the peg.' What does that mean? What have we got to do?""Wait a moment," said Blackberry. "Let me think, and try not to be impatient."Hazel turned his head and looked down the course of the brook. Far away,between the two copses, he could see the cherry tree where two days before hehad sat with Blackberry and Fiver in the sunrise. He remembered how Bigwig hadchased Hawkbit through the long grass, forgetting the quarrel of the previousnight in the joy of their arrival. He could see Hawkbit running toward him nowand two or three of the others -- Silver, Dandelion and Pipkin. Dandelion, well infront, dashed up to the gap and checked, twitching and staring.
<br> "What is it, Hazel? What's happened? Fiver said--""Bigwig's in a wire. Let him alone till Blackberry tells us. Stop the otherscrowding round."Dandelion turned and raced back as Pipkin came up.
<br> "Is Cowslip coming?" said Hazel. "Perhaps he knows--""He wouldn't come," replied Pipkin. "He told Fiver to stop talking about it.""Told him what?" asked Hazel incredulously. But at that moment Blackberryspoke and Hazel was beside him in a flash.
<br> "This is it," said Blackberry. "The wire's on a peg and the peg's in the ground --there, look. We've got to dig it out. Come on -- dig beside it."Hazel dug once more, his forepaws throwing up the soft, wet soil and slippingagainst the hard sides of the peg. Dimly, he was aware of the others waitingnearby. After a time he was forced to stop, panting. Silver took his place, and wasfollowed by Buckthorn. The nasty, smooth, clean, man-smelling peg was laid bareto the length of a rabbit's ear, but still it did not come loose. Bigwig had notmoved. He lay across the wire, torn and bloody, with closed eyes. Buckthorn drewhis head and paws out of the hole and rubbed the mud off his face.
<br> "The peg's narrower down there," he said. "It tapers. I think it could be bittenthrough, but I can't get my teeth to it.""Send Pipkin in," said Blackberry. "He's smaller."Pipkin plunged into the hole. They could hear the wood splintering under histeeth -- a sound like a mouse in a shed wainscot at midnight. He came out withhis nose bleeding.
<br> "The splinters prick you and it's hard to breathe, but the peg's nearly through.""Fiver, go in," said Hazel.
<br> Fiver was not long in the hole. He, too, came out bleeding.
<br> "It's broken in two. It's free."Blackberry pressed his nose against Bigwig's head. As he nuzzled him gentlythe head rolled sideways and back again.
<br> "Bigwig," said Blackberry in his ear, "the peg's out."There was no response. Bigwig lay still as before. A great fly settled on one ofhis ears. Blackberry thrust at it angrily and it flew up, buzzing, into the sunshine.
<br> "I think he's gone," said Blackberry. "I can't feel his breathing."Hazel crouched down by Blackberry and laid his nostrils close to Bigwig's, buta light breeze was blowing and he could not tell whether there was breath or not.
<br> The legs were loose, the belly flaccid and limp. He tried to think of what little hehad heard of snares. A strong rabbit could break his neck in a snare. Or had thepoint of the sharp wire pierced the windpipe?
<br> "Bigwig," he whispered, "we've got you out. You're free."Bigwig did not stir. Suddenly it came to Hazel that if Bigwig was dead -- andwhat else could hold him silent in the mud? -- then he himself must get the othersaway before the dreadful loss could drain their courage and break their spirit -- asit would if they stayed by the body. Besides, the man would come soon. Perhapshe was already coming, with his gun, to take poor Bigwig away. They must go;and he must do his best to see that all of them -- even he himself -- put what hadhappened out of mind, forever.
<br> "My heart has joined the Thousand, for my friend stopped running today," hesaid to Blackberry, quoting a rabbit proverb.
<br> "If only it were not Bigwig," said Blackberry. "What shall we do without him?""The others are waiting," said Hazel. "We have to stay alive. There has to besomething for them to think about. Help me, or it will be more than I can do."He turned away from the body and looked for Fiver among the rabbits behindhim. But Fiver was nowhere to be seen and Hazel was afraid to ask for him, incase to do so should seem like weakness and a need for comfort.
<br> "Pipkin," he snapped, "why don't you clean up your face and stop the bleeding?
<br> The smell of blood attracts elil. You know that, don't you?""Yes, Hazel. I'm sorry. Will Bigwig--""And another thing," said Hazel desperately. "What was it you were telling meabout Cowslip? Did you say he told Fiver to be quiet?""Yes, Hazel. Fiver came into the warren and told us about the snare, and thatpoor Bigwig--""Yes, all right. And then Cowslip--?""Cowslip and Strawberry and the others pretended not to hear. It wasridiculous, because Fiver was calling out to everybody. And then as we wererunning out Silver said to Cowslip, 'Surely you're coming?' And Cowslip simplyturned his back. So then Fiver went up and spoke to him very quietly, but I heardwhat Cowslip answered. He said, 'Hills or Inlé, it's all one to me where you go.
<br> You hold your tongue.' And then he struck at Fiver and scratched his ear.""I'll kill him," gasped a low, choking voice behind them. They all leaped round.
<br> Bigwig had raised his head and was supporting himself on his forepaws alone. Hisbody was twisted and his hind parts and back legs still lay along the ground. Hiseyes were open, but his face was such a fearful mask of blood, foam, vomit andearth that he looked more like some demon creature than a rabbit, Theimmediate sight of him, which should have filled them with relief and joy,brought only terror. They cringed away and none said a word.
<br> "I'll kill him," repeated Bigwig, spluttering through his fouled whiskers andclotted fur. "Help me, rot you! Can't anyone get this stinking wire off me?" Hestruggled, dragging his hind legs. Then he fell again and crawled forward, trailingthe wire through the grass with the broken peg snickering behind it.
<br> "Let him alone!" cried Hazel, for now they were all pressing forward to helphim. "Do you want to kill him? Let him rest! Let him breathe!""No, not rest," panted Bigwig. "I'm all right." As he spoke he fell again andimmediately struggled up on his forepaws as before. "It's my back legs. Won'tmove. That Cowslip! I'll kill him!""Why do we let them stay in that warren?" cried Silver. "What sort of rabbitsare they? They left Bigwig to die. You all heard Cowslip in the burrow. They'recowards. Let's drive them out -- kill them! Take the warren and live thereourselves!""Yes! Yes!" they all answered. "Come on! Back to the warren! Down withCowslip! Down with Silverweed! Kill them!""O embleer Frith!" cried a squealing voice in the long grass.
<br> At this shocking impiety, the tumult died away. They looked about them,wondering who could have spoken. There was silence. Then, from between twogreat tussocks of hair grass came Fiver, his eyes blazing with a frantic urgency. Hegrowled and gibbered at them like a witch hare and those nearest to him fell backin fear. Even Hazel could not have said a word for his life. They realized that hewas speaking.
<br> "The warren? You're going to the warren? You fools! That warren's nothing buta death hole! The whole place is one foul elil's larder! It's snared -- everywhere,every day! That explains everything: everything that's happened since we camehere."He sat still and his words seemed to come crawling up the sunlight, over thegrass.
<br> "Listen, Dandelion. You're fond of stories, aren't you? I'll tell you one -- yes,one for El-ahrairah to cry at. Once there was a fine warren on the edge of a wood,overlooking the meadows of a farm. It was big, full of rabbits. Then one day thewhite blindness came and the rabbits fell sick and died. But a few survived, asthey always do. The warren became almost empty. One day the farmer thought, 'Icould increase those rabbits: make them part of my farm -- their meat, theirskins. Why should I bother to keep rabbits in hutches? They'll do very well wherethey are.' He began to shoot all elil -- lendri, homba, stoat, owl. He put out foodfor the rabbits, but not too near the warren. For his purpose they had to becomeaccustomed to going about in the fields and the wood. And then he snared them --not too many: as many as he wanted and not as many as would frighten them allaway or destroy the warren. They grew big and strong and healthy, for he saw to itthat they had all of the best, particularly in winter, and nothing to fear -- exceptthe running knot in the hedge gap and the wood path. So they lived as he wantedthem to live and all the time there were a few who disappeared. The rabbitsbecame strange in many ways, different from other rabbits. They knew wellenough what was happening. But even to themselves they pretended that all waswell, for the food was good, they were protected, they had nothing to fear but theone fear; and that struck here and there, never enough at a time to drive themaway. They forgot the ways of wild rabbits. They forgot El-ahrairah, for what usehad they for tricks and cunning, living in the enemy's warren and paying hisprice? They found out other marvelous arts to take the place of tricks and oldstories. They danced in ceremonious greeting. They sang songs like the birds andmade Shapes on the walls; and though these could help them not at all, yet theypassed the time and enabled them to tell themselves that they were splendidfellows, the very flower of Rabbitry, cleverer than magpies. They had no ChiefRabbit -- no, how could they? -- for a Chief Rabbit must be El-ahrairah to hiswarren and keep them from death: and here there was no death but one, andwhat Chief Rabbit could have an answer to that? Instead, Frith sent them strangesingers, beautiful and sick like oak apples, like robins' pincushions on the wildrose. And since they could not bear the truth, these singers, who might in someother place have been wise, were squeezed under the terrible weight of thewarren's secret until they gulped out fine folly -- about dignity and acquiescence,and anything else that could make believe that the rabbit loved the shining wire.
<br> But one strict rule they had; oh yes, the strictest. No one must ever ask whereanother rabbit was and anyone who asked 'Where?' -- except in a song or a poem-- must be silenced. To say 'Where?' was bad enough, but to speak openly of thewires -- that was intolerable. For that they would scratch and kill."He stopped. No one moved. Then, in the silence, Bigwig lurched to his feet,swayed a moment, tottered a few steps toward Fiver and fell again. Fiver paid himno heed, but looked from one to another among the rabbits. Then he beganspeaking again.
<br> "And then we came, over the heather in the night. Wild rabbits, makingscrapes across the valley. The warren rabbits didn't show themselves at once.
<br> They needed to think what was best to be done. But they hit on it quite soon. Tobring us into the warren and tell us nothing. Don't you see? The farmer only setsso many snares at a time, and if one rabbit dies, the others will live that muchlonger. You suggested that Hazel should tell them our adventures, Blackberry,but it didn't go down well, did it? Who wants to hear about brave deeds when he'sashamed of his own, and who likes an open, honest tale from someone he'sdeceiving? Do you want me to go on? I tell you, every single thing that's happenedfits like a bee in a foxglove. And kill them, you say, and help ourselves to the greatburrow? We shall help ourselves to a roof of bones, hung with shining wires! Helpourselves to misery and death!"Fiver sank down into the grass. Bigwig, still trailing his horrible, smooth peg,staggered up to him and touched his nose with his own.
<br> "I'm still alive, Fiver," he said. "So are all of us. You've bitten through a biggerpeg than this one I'm dragging. Tell us what to do.""Do?" replied Fiver. "Why, go -- now. I told Cowslip we were going before I leftthe burrow.""Where?" said Bigwig. But it was Hazel who answered.
<br> "To the hills," he said.
<br> South of them, the ground rose gently away from the brook. Along the crestwas the line of a cart track and beyond, a copse. Hazel turned toward it and therest began to follow him up the slope in ones and twos.
<br> "What about the wire, Bigwig?" said Silver. "The peg will catch and tighten itagain.""No, it's loose now," said Bigwig "I could shake it off if I hadn't hurt my neck.""Try," said Silver. "You won't get far otherwise.""Hazel," said Speedwell suddenly, "there's a rabbit coming down from thewarren. Look!""Only one?" said Bigwig. "What a pity! You take him, Silver. I won't depriveyou. Make a good job of it while you're at it."They stopped and waited, dotted here and there about the slope. The rabbitwho was coming was running in a curious, headlong manner. Once he ranstraight into a thick-stemmed thistle, knocking himself sideways and rolling overand over. But he got up and came blundering on toward them.
<br> "Is it the white blindness?" said Buckthorn. "He's not looking where he'sgoing.""Frith forbid!" said Blackberry. "Shall we run away?""No, he couldn't run like that with the white blindness," said Hazel. "Whateverails him, it isn't that.""It's Strawberry!" cried Dandelion.
<br> Strawberry came through the hedge by the crab-apple tree, looked about himand made his way to Hazel. All his urbane self-possession had vanished. He wasstaring and trembling and his great size seemed only to add to his air of strickenmisery. He cringed before them in the grass as Hazel waited, stern andmotionless, with Silver at his side.
<br> "Hazel," said Strawberry, "are you going away?"Hazel made no answer, but Silver said sharply, "What's that to you?""Take me with you." There was no reply and he repeated, "Take me with you.""We don't care for creatures who deceive us," said Silver. "Better go back toNildro-hain. No doubt she's less particular."Strawberry gave a kind of choking squeal, as though he had been wounded. Helooked from Silver to Hazel and then to Fiver. At last, in a pitiful whisper, he said,"The wires."Silver was about to answer, but Hazel spoke first.
<br> "You can come with us," he said. "Don't say any more. Poor fellow."A few minutes later the rabbits had crossed the cart track and vanished intothe copse beyond. A magpie, seeing some light-colored object conspicuous on theempty slope, flew closer to look. But all that lay there was a splintered peg and atwisted length of wire.
