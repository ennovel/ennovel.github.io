<br> The holes certainly were rough -- "Just right for a lot of vagabonds* like us,"said Bigwig -- but the exhausted and those who wander in strange country are notparticular about therr quarters. At least there was room for twelve rabbits and theburrows were dry. Two of the runs -- the ones among the thorn trees -- ledstraight down to burrows scooped out of the top of the chalk subsoil. Rabbits donot line their sleeping places and a hard, almost rocky floor is uncomfortable forthose not accustomed to it. The holes in the bank, however, had runs of the usualbow shape, leading down to the chalk and then curving up again to burrows withfloors of trampled earth. There were no connecting passages, but the rabbits weretoo weary to care. They slept four to a burrow, snug and secure. Hazel remainedawake for some time, licking Buckthorn's leg, which was stiff and tender. He wasreassured to find no smell of infection, but all that he had ever heard about ratsdecided him to see that Buckthorn got a good deal of rest and was kept out of thedirt until the wound was better. "That's the third one of us to get hurt: still, all inall, things could have been far worse," he thought, as he fell asleep.
<br> The short June darkness slipped by in a few hours. The light returned early tothe high down, but the rabbits did not stir. Well after dawn they were stillsleeping, undisturbed in a silence deeper than they had ever known. Nowadays,among fields and woods, the noise level by day is high -- too high for some kindsof animal to tolerate. Few places are far from human noise -- cars, buses,motorcycles, tractors, lorries. The sound of a housing estate in the morning isaudible a long way off. People who record birdsong generally do it very early --before six o'clock -- if they can. Soon after that, the invasion of distant noise inmost woodland becomes too constant and too loud. During the last fifty years thesilence of much of the country has been destroyed. But here, on Watership Down,there floated up only faint traces of the daylight noise below.
<br> The sun was well up, though not yet as high as the down, when Hazel woke.
<br> With him in the burrow were Buckthorn, Fiver and Pipkin. He was nearest to themouth of the hole and did not wake them as he slipped up the run. Outside, hestopped to pass hraka and then hopped through the thorn patch to the opengrass. Below, the country was covered with early-morning mist which wasbeginning to clear. Here and there, far off, were the shapes of trees and roofs,from which streamers of mist trailed down like broken waves pouring from rocks.
<br> The sky was cloudless and deep blue, darkening to mauve along the whole rim ofthe horizon. The wind had dropped and the spiders had already gone well downinto the grass. It was going to be a hot day.
<br> Hazel rambled about in the usual way of a rabbit feeding -- five or six slow,rocking hops through the grass; a pause to look round, sitting up with ears erect;then busy nibbling for a short time, followed by another move of a few yards. Forthe first time for many days he felt relaxed and safe. He began to wonder whetherthey had much to learn about their new home.
<br> "Fiver was right," he thought. "This is the place for us. But we shall need to getused to it and the fewer mistakes we make the better. I wonder what became ofthe rabbits who made these holes? Did they stop running or did they just moveaway? If we could only find them they could tell us a lot."At this moment he saw a rabbit come rather hesitantly out of the hole furthestfrom himself. It was Blackberry. He, too, passed hraka, scratched himself andthen hopped into the full sunlight and combed his ears. As he began to feed,Hazel came up and fell in with him, nibbling among the grass tussocks andwandering on wherever his friend pleased. They came to a patch of milkwort -- ablue as deep as that of the sky -- with long stems creeping through the grass andeach minute flower spreading its two upper petals like wings. Blackberry sniffedat it, but the leaves were tough and unappetizing.
<br> "What is this stuff, do you know?" he asked.
<br> "No, I don't," said Hazel. "I've never seen it before.""There's a lot we don't know," said Blackberry. "About this place, I mean. Theplants are new, the smells are new. We're going to need some new ideasourselves.""Well, you're the fellow for ideas," said Hazel. "I never know anything until youtell me.""But you go in front and take the risks first," answered Blackberry. "We've allseen that. And now our journey's over, isn't it? This place is as safe as Fiver said itwould be. Nothing can get near us without our knowing: that is, as long as we cansmell and see and hear.""We can all do that.""Not when we're asleep: and we can't see in the dark.""It's bound to be dark at night," said Hazel, "and rabbits have got to sleep.""In the open?""Well, we can go on using these holes if we want to, but I expect a good manywill lie out. After all, you can't expect a bunch of bucks to dig. They might make ascrape or two -- like that day after we came over the heather -- but they won't domore than that.""That's what I've been thinking about," said Blackberry. "Those rabbits we left-- Cowslip and the rest -- a lot of the things they did weren't natural to rabbits --pushing stones into the earth and carrying food underground and Frith knowswhat.""The Threarah's lettuce was carried underground, if it comes to that.""Exactly. Don't you see, they'd altered what rabbits do naturally because theythought they could do better? And if they altered their ways, so can we if we like.
<br> You say buck rabbits don't dig. Nor they do. But they could, if they wanted to.
<br> Suppose we had deep, comfortable burrows to sleep in? To be out of bad weatherand underground at night? Then we would be safe. And there's nothing to stop ushaving them, except that buck rabbits won't dig. Not can't -- won't.""What's your idea, then?" asked Hazel, half interested and half reluctant. "Doyou want us to try to turn these holes into a regular warren?""No, these holes won't do. It's easy to see why they've been deserted. Only alittle way down and you come to this hard white stuff that no one can dig. Theymust be bitterly cold in winter. But there's a wood just over the top of the hill. Igot a glimpse of it last night when we came. Suppose we go up higher now, justyou and I, and have a look at it?"They ran uphill to the summit. The beech hanger lay some little way off to thesoutheast, on the far side of a grassy track that ran along the ridge.
<br> "There are some big trees there," said Blackberry. "The roots must have brokenup the ground pretty deep. We could dig holes and be as well off as ever we werein the old warren. But if Bigwig and the others won't dig or say they can't -- well,it's bare and bleak here. That's why it's lonely and safe, of course; but when badweather comes we shall be driven off the hills for sure.""It never entered my head to try to make a lot of bucks dig regular holes," saidHazel doubtfully, as they returned down the slope. "Rabbit kittens need holes, ofcourse; but do we?""We were all born in a warren that was dug before our mothers were born,"said Blackberry. "We're used to holes and not one of us has ever helped to digone. And if ever there was a new one, who dug it? A doe. I'm quite sure, myself,that if we don't change our natural ways we shan't be able to stay here very long.
<br> Somewhere else, perhaps; but not here.""It'll mean a lot of work.""Look, there's Bigwig come up now and some of the others with him. Why notput it to them and see what they say?"During silflay, however, Hazel mentioned Blackberry's idea to no one butFiver. Later on, when most of the rabbits had finished feeding and were eitherplaying in the grass or lying in the sunshine, he suggested that they might goacross to the hanger -- "Just to see what sort of a wood it is." Bigwig and Silveragreed at once and in the end no one stayed behind.
<br> It was different from the meadow copses they had left: a narrow belt of trees,four or five hundred yards long but barely fifty wide; a kind of windbreakcommon on the downs. It consisted almost entirely of well-grown beeches. Thegreat, smooth trunks stood motionless in their green shade, the branchesspreading flat, one above another in crisp, light-dappled tiers. Between the treesthe ground was open and offered hardly any cover. The rabbits were perplexed.
<br> They could not make out why the wood was so light and still and why they couldsee so far between the trees. The continuous, gentle rustling of the beech leaveswas unlike the sounds to be heard in a copse of nut bushes, oak and silver birch.
<br> Moving uncertainly in and out along the edge of the hanger, they came to thenortheast corner. Here there was a bank from which they looked out over theempty stretches of grass beyond. Fiver, absurdly small beside the hulking Bigwig,turned to Hazel with an air of happy confidence.
<br> "I'm sure Blackberry's right, Hazel," he said. "We ought to do our best to makesome holes here. I'm ready to try, anyway."The others were taken aback. Pipkin, however, readily joined Hazel at the footof the bank and soon two or three more began scratching at the light soil. Thedigging was easy and although they often broke off to feed or merely to sit in thesun, before midday Hazel was out of sight and tunneling between the tree roots.
<br> The hanger might have little or no undergrowth but at least the branches gavecover from the sky: and kestrels, they soon realized, were common in thissolitude. Although kestrels seldom prey on anything bigger than a rat, they willsometimes attack young rabbits. No doubt this is why most grown rabbits will notremain under a hovering kestrel. Before long, Acorn spotted one as it flew upfrom the south. He stamped and bolted into the trees, followed by the otherrabbits who were in the open. They had not long come out and resumed diggingwhen they saw another -- or perhaps the same one -- hovering some way off, highover the very fields that they had crossed the previous morning. Hazel placedBuckthorn as a sentry while the day's haphazard work went on, and twice moreduring the afternoon the alarm was given. In the early evening they weredisturbed by a horseman cantering along the ridge track that passed the northend of the wood. Otherwise they saw nothing larger than a pigeon all day.
<br> After the horseman had turned south near the summit of Watership anddisappeared in the distance, Hazel returned to the edge of the wood and lookedout northward toward the bright, still fields and the dim pylon line stalking awayinto the distance north of Kingsclere. The air was cooler and the sun wasbeginning once more to reach the north escarpment.
<br> "I think we've done enough," he said, "for today, anyway. I should like to godown to the bottom of the hill and find some really good grass. This stuff's allright in its way but it's rather thin and dry. Does anyone feel like coming withme?"Bigwig, Dandelion and Speedwell were ready, but the others preferred to grazetheir way back to the thorn trees and go underground with the sun. Bigwig andHazel picked the line that offered most cover and, with the others following, setout on the four or five hundred yards to the foot of the hill. They met no troubleand were soon feeding in the grass at the edge of the wheatfield, the very pictureof rabbits in an evening landscape. Hazel, tired though he was, did not forget tolook for somewhere to bolt if there should be an alarm. He was lucky enough tocome upon a short length of old, overgrown ditch, partly fallen in and so heavilyoverhung with cow parsley and nettles that it was almost as sheltered as a tunnel;and all four of them made sure that they could reach it quickly from the open.
<br> "That'll be good enough at a pinch," said Bigwig, munching clover and sniffingat the fallen bloom from a wayfaring tree. "My goodness, we've learned a fewthings since we left the old warren, haven't we? More than we'd have learned in alifetime back there. And digging! It'll be flying next, I suppose. Have you noticedthat this soil's quite different from the soil in the old warren? It smells differentlyand it slides and falls quite differently, too.""That reminds me," said Hazel. "I meant to ask you. There was one thing atthat terrible warren of Cowslip's that I admired very much -- the great burrow. I'dlike to copy it. It's a wonderful idea to have a place underground where everybodycan be together -- talk and tell stories and so on. What do you think? Could it bedone?"Bigwig considered. "I know this," he said. "If you make a burrow too big theroof starts falling in. So if you want a place like that you'll need something to holdthe roof up. What did Cowslip have?""Tree roots.""Well, there are those where we're digging. But are they the right sort?""We'd better get Strawberry to tell us what he knows about the great burrow;but it may not be much, I'm sure he wasn't alive when it was dug.""He may not be dead when it falls in either. That warren's tharn as an owl indaylight. He was wise to leave when he did."Twilight had fallen over the cornfield, for although long red rays still lit theupper down, the sun had set below. The uneven shadow of the hedge had fadedand disappeared. There was a cool smell of moisture and approaching darkness. Acockchafer droned past. The grasshoppers had fallen silent.
<br> "Owls'll be out," said Bigwig. "Let's go up again."At this moment, from out in the darkening field, there came the sound of astamp on the ground. It was followed by another, closer to them, and they caughta glimpse of a white tail. They both immediately ran to the ditch. Now that theyhad to use it in earnest, they found it even narrower than they had thought. Therewas just room to turn round at the far end and as they did so Speedwell andDandelion tumbled in behind them.
<br> "What is it?" asked Hazel. "What did you hear?""There's something coming up the line of the hedge," replied Speedwell. "Ananimal. Making a lot of noise, too.""Did you see it?""No, and I couldn't smell it either. It's downwind. But I heard it plainlyenough.""I heard it, too," said Dandelion. "Something fairly big -- as big as a rabbit,anyway -- moving clumsily but trying to keep concealed, or so it seemed to me.""Homba?""No, that we should have smelled," said Bigwig, "wind or no wind. From whatyou say, it sounds like a cat. I hope it's not a stoat. Hoi, hoi, u embleer hrair!
<br> What a nuisance! We'd better sit tight for a bit. But get ready to bolt if it spotsus."They waited. Soon it grew dark. Only the faintest light came through thetangled summer growth above them. The far end of the ditch was so muchovergrown that they could not see out of it, but the place where they had come inshowed as a patch of sky -- an arc of very dark blue. As the time passed, a starcrept out from among the overhanging grasses. It seemed to pulsate in a rhythmas faint and uneven as that of the wind. At length Hazel turned his eyes awayfrom watching it.
<br> "Well, we can snatch some sleep here," he said. "The night's not cold. Whateverit was you heard, we'd better not risk going out.""Listen," said Dandelion. "What's that?"For a moment Hazel could hear nothing. Then he caught a distant but clearsound -- a kind of wailing or crying, wavering and intermittent. Although it didnot sound like any sort of hunting call, it was so unnatural that it filled him withfear. As he listened, it ceased.
<br> "What in Frith's name makes a noise like that?" said Bigwig, his great fur caphackling between his ears.
<br> "A cat?" said Speedwell, wide-eyed.
<br> "That's no cat!" said Bigwig, his lips drawn back in a stiffened, unnaturalgrimace, "That's no cat! Don't you know what it is? Your mother--" He broke off.
<br> Then he said, very low, "Your mother told you, didn't she?""No!" cried Dandelion. "No! It's some bird -- some rat -- wounded--"Bigwig stood up. His back was arched and his head nodded on his stiffenedneck.
<br> "The Black Rabbit of Inlé," he whispered, "What else -- in a place like this?""Don't talk like that!" said Hazel. He could feel himself trembling, and bracedhis legs against the sides of the narrow cut.
<br> Suddenly the noise sounded again, nearer: and now there could be no mistake.
<br> What they heard was the voice of a rabbit, but changed out of all recognition. Itmight have come from the cold spaces of the dark sky outside, so unearthly anddesolate was the sound. At first there was only a wailing. Then, distinct andbeyond mistaking, they heard -- they all heard -- words.
<br> "Zorn! Zorn!"* cried the dreadful, squealing voice. "All dead! O zorn!"Dandelion whimpered. Bigwig was scuffling into the ground.
<br> "Be quiet!" said Hazel. "And stop kicking that earth over me! I want to listen,"At that moment, quite distinctly, the voice cried, "Thlayli! O Thlayli!"At this, all four rabbits felt the trance of utter panic. They grew rigid. ThenBigwig, his eyes set in a fixed, glazed stare, began to jerk his way up the ditchtoward the opening. "You have to go," he muttered, so thickly that Hazel couldhardly catch the words. "You have to go when he calls you."Hazel felt so much frightened that he could no longer collect his wits. As on theriverbank, his surroundings became unreal and dream-like. Who -- or what -- wascalling Bigwig by name? How could any living creature in this place know hisname? Only one idea remained to him -- Bigwig must be prevented from goingout, for he was helpless. He scrambled past him, pressing him against the side ofthe ditch.
<br> "Stay where you are," he said, panting, "Whatever sort of rabbit it is, I'm goingto see for myself." Then, his legs almost giving way beneath him, he pulledhimself out into the open.
<br> For a few moments he could see little or nothing; but the smells of dew andelder bloom were unchanged and his nose brushed against cool grass blades. Hesat up and looked about him. There was no creature nearby.
<br> "Who's there?" he said.
<br> There was silence, and he was about to speak again when the voice replied,"Zorn! O zorn!"It came from the hedge along the side of the field. Hazel turned toward thesound and in a few moments made out, under a clump of hemlock, the hunchedshape of a rabbit. He approached it and said, "Who are you?" but there was noreply. As he hesitated, he heard a movement behind him.
<br> "I'm here, Hazel," said Dandelion, in a kind of choking gasp.
<br> Together they went closer. The figure did not move as they came up. In thefaint starlight they both saw a rabbit as real as themselves: a rabbit in the laststages of exhaustion, its back legs trailing behind its flattened rump as thoughparalyzed: a rabbit that stared, white-eyed, from one side to the other, seeingnothing, yet finding no respite from its fear, and then fell to licking wretchedly atone ripped and bloody ear that drooped across its face: a rabbit that suddenlycried and wailed as though entreating the Thousand to come from every quarterto rid it of a misery too terrible to be borne.
<br> It was Captain Holly of the Sandleford Owsla.
<br> *Bigwig's word was hlessil, which I have rendered in various places in the storyas wanderers, scratchers, vagabonds. A hlessi is a rabbit living in the open,without a hole. Solitary bucks and unmated rabbits who are wandering do this forquite long periods, especially in summer. Bucks do not usually dig much in anycase, although they will scratch shallow shelters or make use of existing holeswhere these are available. Real digging is done for the most part by doespreparing for litters.
<br> *Zorn means "finished" or "destroyed," in the sense of some terriblecatastrophe.
