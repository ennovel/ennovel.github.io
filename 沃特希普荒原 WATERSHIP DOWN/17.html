Silverweed</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      He said, "Dance for me" and he said,"You are too beautiful for the windTo pick at, or the sun to burn." He said,"I'm a poor tattered thing, but not unkindTo the sad dancer and the dancing dead."Sidney Keyes, Four Postures of Death"Well done," said Hazel, as Dandelion ended.
<br> "He's very good, isn't he?" said Silver. "We're lucky to have him with us. Itraises your spirits just to hear him.""That's put their ears flat for them," whispered Bigwig. "Let's just see them finda storyteller to beat him."They were all in no doubt that Dandelion had done them credit. Ever sincetheir arrival most of them had felt out of their depth among these magnificent,well-fed strangers, with their detached manners, their Shapes on the wall, theirelegance, their adroit evasion of almost all questions -- above all, their fits of un-rabbitlike melancholy. Now, their own storyteller had shown that they were nomere bunch of tramps. Certainly, no reasonable rabbit could withholdadmiration. They waited to be told as much, but after a few moments realizedwith surprise that their hosts were evidently less enthusiastic.
<br> "Very nice," said Cowslip. He seemed to be searching for something more tosay, but then repeated, "Yes, very nice. An unusual tale.""But he must know it, surely?" muttered Blackberry to Hazel.
<br> "I always think these traditional stories retain a lot of charm," said another ofthe rabbits, "especially when they're told in the real, old-fashioned spirit.""Yes," said Strawberry. "Conviction, that's what it needs. You really have tobelieve in El-ahrairah and Prince Rainbow, don't you? Then all the rest follows.""Don't say anything, Bigwig," whispered Hazel: for Bigwig was scuffling hispaws indignantly. "You can't force them to like it if they don't. Let's wait and seewhat they can do themselves." Aloud, he said, "Our stories haven't changed ingenerations, you know. After all, we haven't changed ourselves. Our lives havebeen the same as our fathers' and their fathers' before them. Things are differenthere. We realize that, and we think your new ideas and ways are very exciting.
<br> We're all wondering what kind of things you tell stories about.""Well, we don't tell the old stories very much," said Cowslip. "Our stories andpoems are mostly about our own lives here. Of course, that Shape of Laburnumthat you saw -- that's old-fashioned now. El-ahrairah doesn't really mean much tous. Not that your friend's story wasn't very charming," he added hastily.
<br> "El-ahrairah is a trickster," said Buckthorn, "and rabbits will always needtricks.""No," said a new voice from the further end of the hall, beyond Cowslip.
<br> "Rabbits need dignity and, above all, the will to accept their fate.""We think Silverweed is one of the best poets we've had for many months,"said Cowslip. "His ideas have a great following. Would you like to hear him now?""Yes, yes," said voices from all sides. "Silverweed!""Hazel," said Fiver suddenly, "I want to get a clear idea of this Silverweed, but Idaren't go closer by myself. Will you come with me?""Why, Fiver, whatever do you mean? What is there to be afraid of?""Oh, Frith help me!" said Fiver, trembling. "I can smell him from here. Heterrifies me.""Oh, Fiver, don't be absurd! He just smells the same as the rest of them.""He smells like barley rained down and left to rot in the fields. He smells like awounded mole that can't get underground.""He smells like a big, fat rabbit to me, with a lot of carrots inside. But I'll comewith you."When they had edged their way through the crowd to the far end of theburrow, Hazel was surprised to realize that Silverweed was a mere youngster. Inthe Sandleford warren no rabbit of his age would have been asked to tell a story,except perhaps to a few friends alone. He had a wild, desperate air and his earstwitched continually. As he began to speak, he seemed to grow less and less awareof his audience and continually turned his head, as though listening to somesound, audible only to himself, from the entrance tunnel behind him. But therewas an arresting fascination in his voice, like the movement of wind and light on ameadow, and as its rhythm entered into his hearers the whole burrow becamesilent.
<br> The wind is blowing, blowing over the grass.
<br> It shakes the willow catkins; the leaves shine silver.
<br> Where are you going, wind? Far, far awayOver the hills, over the edge of the world.
<br> Take me with you, wind, high over the sky.
<br> I will go with you, I will be rabbit-of-the-wind,Into the sky, the feathery sky and the rabbit.
<br> The stream is running, running over the gravel,Through the brooklime, the kingcups, the blue and gold of spring.
<br> Where are you going, stream? Far, far awayBeyond the heather, sliding away all night.
<br> Take me with you, stream, away in the starlight.
<br> I will go with you, I will be rabbit-of-the-stream,Down through the water, the green water and the rabbit.
<br> In autumn the leaves come blowing, yellow and brown.
<br> They rustle in the ditches, they tug and hang on the hedge.
<br> Where are you going leaves? Far, far awayInto the earth we go, with the rain and the berries.
<br> Take me, leaves, O take me on your dark journey.
<br> I will go with you, I will be rabbit-of-the-leaves,In the deep places of the earth, the earth and the rabbit.
<br> Frith lies in the evening sky. The clouds are red about him.
<br> I am here, Lord Frith, I am running through the long grass.
<br> O take me with you, dropping behind the woods,Far away, to the heart of light, the silence.
<br> For I am ready to give you my breath, my life,The shining circle of the sun, the sun and the rabbit.
<br> Fiver, as he listened, had shown a mixture of intense absorption andincredulous horror. At one and the same time he seemed to accept every wordand yet to be stricken with fear. Once he drew in his breath, as though startled torecognize his own half-known thoughts; and when the poem was ended heseemed to be struggling to come to himself. He bared his teeth and licked his lips,as Blackberry had done before the dead hedgehog on the road.
<br> A rabbit in fear of an enemy will sometimes crouch stock still, either fascinatedor else trusting to its natural inconspicuousness to remain unnoticed. But then,unless the fascination is too powerful, there comes the point when keeping still isdiscarded and the rabbit, as though breaking a spell, turns in an instant to itsother resource -- flight. So it seemed to be with Fiver now. Suddenly he leaped upand began to push his way violently across the great burrow. Several rabbits werejostled and turned angrily on him, but he took no notice. Then he came to a placewhere he could not push between two heavy warren bucks. He became hysterical,kicking and scuffling, and Hazel, who was behind him, had difficulty inpreventing a fight.
<br> "My brother's a sort of poet, too, you know," he said to the bristling strangers.
<br> "Things affect him very strongly sometimes and he doesn't always know why."One of the rabbits seemed to accept what Hazel had said, but the other replied,"Oh, another poet? Let's hear him, then. That'll be some return for my shoulder,anyway. He's scratched a great tuft of fur out."Fiver was already beyond them and thrusting toward the further entrancetunnel. Hazel felt that he must follow him. But after all the trouble that hehimself had taken to be friendly, he felt so cross at the way in which Fiver hadantagonized their new friends that as he passed Bigwig, he said, "Come and helpme to get some sense into him. The last thing we want is a fight now." He felt thatFiver really deserved a short touch of Bigwig.
<br> They followed Fiver up the run and overtook him at the entrance. Before eitherof them could say a word, he turned and began to speak as though they had askedhim a question.
<br> "You felt it, then? And you want to know whether I did? Of course I did. That'sthe worst part of it. There isn't any trick. He speaks the truth. So as long as hespeaks the truth it can't be folly -- that's what you're going to say, isn't it? I'm notblaming you, Hazel. I felt myself moving toward him like one cloud drifting intoanother. But then at the last moment I drifted wide. Who knows why? It wasn'tmy own will; it was an accident. There was just some little part of me that carriedme wide of him. Did I say the roof of that hall was made of bones? No! It's like agreat mist of folly that covers the whole sky: and we shall never see to go byFrith's light any more. Oh, what will become of us? A thing can be true and still bedesperate folly, Hazel.""What on earth's all this?" said Hazel to Bigwig in perplexity.
<br> "He's talking about that lop-eared nitwit of a poet down there," answeredBigwig. "I know that much. But why he seems to think we should want to haveanything to do with him and his fancy talk -- that's more than I can imagine. Youcan save your breath, Fiver. The only thing that's bothering us is the row you'vestarted. As for Silverweed, all I can say is, I'll keep Silver and he can be just plainWeed."Fiver gazed back at him with eyes that, like a fly's, seemed larger than his head.
<br> "You think that," he said. "You believe that. But each of you, in his own way, isthick in that mist. Where is the--"Hazel interrupted him and as he did so Fiver started. "Fiver, I won't pretendthat I didn't follow you up here to speak angrily. You've endangered our goodstart in this warren--"Endangered?" cried Fiver. "Endangered? Why, the whole place--""Be quiet. I was going to be angry, but you're obviously so much upset that itwould be pointless. But what you are going to do now is to come undergroundwith the two of us and sleep. Come on! And don't say any more for the moment."One respect in which rabbits' lives are less complicated than those of humansis that they are not ashamed to use force. Having no alternative, Fiveraccompanied Hazel and Bigwig to the burrow where Hazel had spent the previousnight. There was no one there and they lay down and slept.
