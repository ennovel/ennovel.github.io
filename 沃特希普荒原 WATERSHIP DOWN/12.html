Hard Going</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      Then Sir Beaumains... rode all that ever he might ride through marshes andfields and great dales, that many times... he plunged over the head in deep mires,for he knew not the way, but took the gainest way in that woodness.... And at thelast him happened to come to a fair green way.
<br> Malory, Le Morte d'ArthurWhen Hazel and Fiver reached the floor of the hollow they found Blackberrywailing for them, crouching on the peat and nibbling at a few brown stalks ofsedge grass.
<br> "Hello," said Hazel. "What's happened? Where are the others?""Over there," answered Blackberry. "There's been a fearful row. Bigwig toldHawkbit and Speedwell that he'd scratch them to pieces if they didn't obey him.
<br> And when Hawkbit said he wanted to know who was Chief Rabbit, Bigwig bithim. It seems a nasty business. Who is Chief Rabbit, anyway -- you or Bigwig?""I don't know," answered Hazel, "but Bigwig's certainly the strongest. Therewas no need to go biting Hawkbit: he couldn't have gone back if he'd tried. Heand his friends would have seen that if they'd been allowed to talk for a bit. NowBigwig's put their backs up, and they'll think they've got to go on because hemakes them. I want them to go on because they can see it's the only thing to do.
<br> There are too few of us for giving orders and biting people. Frith in a fog! Isn'tthere enough trouble and danger already?"They went over to the far end of the pit. Bigwig and Silver were talking withBuckthorn under an overhanging broom. Nearby, Pipkin and Dandelion werepretending to feed on a patch of scrub. Some way away, Acorn was making a greatbusiness of licking Hawkbit's throat, while Speedwell watched.
<br> "Keep still if you can, poor old chap," said Acorn, who obviously wanted to beoverheard. "Just let me clean the blood out. Steady, now!" Hawkbit winced in anexaggerated manner and backed away. As Hazel came up, all the rabbits turnedand stared at him expectantly.
<br> "Look," said Hazel, "I know there's been some trouble, but the best thing willbe to try to forget it. This is a bad place, but we'll soon get out of it.""Do you really think we will?" asked Dandelion.
<br> "If you'll follow me now," replied Hazel desperately, "I'll have you out of it bysunrise.""If I don't," he thought, "they'll very likely tear me to bits, and much good mayit do them."For the second time he made his way out of the pit, and the others followed.
<br> The weary, frightening journey began again, broken only by alarms. Once a whiteowl swept silently overhead, so low that Hazel saw its dark, searching eyeslooking into his own. But either it was not hunting or he was too big to tackle, forit disappeared over the heather; and although he waited motionless for sometime, it did not return. Once Dandelion struck the smell of a stoat and they alljoined him, whispering and sniffing over the ground. But the scent was old andafter a time they went on again. In this low undergrowth their disorganizedprogress and uneven, differing rhythms of movement delayed them still morethan in the wood. There were continual stampings of alarm, pausing, freezing tothe spot at the sound of movement real or imagined. It was so dark that Hazelseldom knew for certain whether he was leading or whether Bigwig or Silvermight not be ahead. Once, hearing an unaccountable noise in front of him, whichceased on the instant, he kept still for a long time; and when at last he movedcautiously forward, found Silver crouching behind a tussock of cocksfoot for fearof the sound of his own approach. All was confusion, ignorance, clambering andexhaustion. Throughout the bad dream of the night's journey, Pipkin seemed tobe always close beside him. Though each of the others vanished and reappearedlike fragments floating round a pool, Pipkin never left him; and his need forencouragement became at last Hazel's only support against his own weariness.
<br> "Not far now, Hlao-roo, not far now," he kept muttering, until he realized thatwhat he said had become meaningless, a mere refrain. He was not speaking toPipkin or even to himself. He was talking in his sleep, or something very near it.
<br> At last he saw the first of the dawn, like light faintly perceived round a cornerat the far end of an unknown burrow; and in the same moment a yellowhammersang. Hazel's feelings were like those which might pass through the mind of adefeated general. Where were his followers exactly? He hoped, not far away. Butwere they? All of them? Where had he led them? What was he going to do now?
<br> What if an enemy appeared at this moment? He had answers to none of thesequestions and no spirit left to force himself to think about them. Behind him,Pipkin shivered in the damp, and he turned and nuzzled him -- much as thegeneral, with nothing left to do, might fall to considering the welfare of hisservant, simply because the servant happened to be there.
<br> The light grew stronger and soon he could see that a little way ahead there wasan open track of bare gravel. He limped out of the heather, sat on the stones andshook the wet from his fur. He could see Fiver's hills plainly now, greenish-grayand seeming close in the rain-laden air. He could even pick out the dots of furzebushes and stunted yew trees on the steep slopes. As he gazed at them, he heardan excited voice further down the track.
<br> "He's done it! Didn't I tell you he'd do it?"Hazel turned his head and saw Blackberry on the path. He was bedraggled andexhausted, but it was he who was speaking. Out of the heather behind him cameAcorn, Speedwell and Buckthorn. All four rabbits were now staring straight athim. He wondered why. Then, as they approached, he realized that they werelooking not at him, but past him at something further off. He turned round. Thegravel track led downhill into a narrow belt of silver birch and rowan. Beyond wasa thin hedge; and beyond that, a green field between two copses. They hadreached the other side of the common.
<br> "Oh, Hazel," said Blackberry, coming up to him round a puddle in the gravel. "Iwas so tired and confused, I actually began to wonder whether you knew whereyou were going. I could hear you in the heather, saying 'Not far now' and it wasannoying me. I thought you were making it up. I should have known better.
<br> Frithrah, you're what I call a Chief Rabbit!""Well done, Hazel!" said Buckthorn. "Well done!"Hazel did not know what to reply. He looked at them in silence and it wasAcorn who spoke next.
<br> "Come on!" he said. "Who's going to be first into that field? I can still run." Hewas off, slowly enough, down the slope, but when Hazel stamped for him to stophe did so at once.
<br> "Where are the others?" said Hazel. "Dandelion? Bigwig?"At that moment Dandelion appeared out of the heather and sat on the path,looking at the field. He was followed first by Hawkbit and then by Fiver. Hazelwas watching Fiver as he took in the sight of the field, when Buckthorn drew hisattention back to the foot of the slope.
<br> "Look, Hazel," he said, "Silver and Bigwig are down there. They're waiting forus."Silver's light-gray fur showed up plainly against a low spray of gorse, but Hazelcould not see Bigwig until he sat up and ran toward them.
<br> "Splendid, Hazel," he said. "Everybody's here. Let's get them into that field."A few moments later they were under the silver birches and as the sun rose,striking flashes of red and green from the drops on ferns and twigs, theyscrambled through the hedge, across a shallow ditch and into the thick grass ofthe meadow.
