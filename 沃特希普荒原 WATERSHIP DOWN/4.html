<br> Xenophon, The Anabasis"But, Hazel, you didn't really think the Chief Rabbit would act on your advice,did you? What were you expecting?"It was evening once more and Hazel and Fiver were feeding outside the woodwith two friends. Blackberry, the rabbit with tipped ears who had been startled byFiver the night before, had listened carefully to Hazel's description of the noticeboard, remarking that he had always felt sure that men left these things about toact as signs or messages of some kind, in the same way that rabbits left marks onruns and gaps. It was another neighbor, Dandelion, who had now brought thetalk back to the Threarah and his indifference to Fiver's fear.
<br> "I don't know what I expected," said Hazel. "I'd never been near the ChiefRabbit before. But I thought, 'Well, even if he won't listen, at least no one can sayafterward that we didn't do our best to warn him.'""You're sure, then, that there's really something to be afraid of?""I'm quite certain. I've always known Fiver, you see."Blackberry was about to reply when another rabbit came noisily through thethick dog's mercury in the wood, blundered down into the brambles and pushedhis way up from the ditch. It was Bigwig.
<br> "Hello, Bigwig," said Hazel. "You're off duty?""Off duty" said Bigwig, "and likely to remain off duty.""How do you mean?""I've left the Owsla, that's what I mean.""Not on our account?""You could say that. The Threarah's rather good at making himself unpleasantwhen he's been woken up at ni-Frith for what he considers a piece of trivialnonsense. He certainly knows how to get under your skin. I dare say a good manyrabbits would have kept quiet and thought about keeping on the right side of theChief, but I'm afraid I'm not much good at that. I told him that the Owsla'sprivileges didn't mean all that much to me in any case and that a strong rabbitcould always do just as well by leaving the warren. He told me not to be impulsiveand think it over, but I shan't stay. Lettuce-stealing isn't my idea of a jolly life, norsentry duty in the burrow. I'm in a fine temper, I can tell you.""No one will steal lettuces soon," said Fiver quietly.
<br> "Oh, that's you, Fiver, is it?" said Bigwig, noticing him for the first time. "Good,I was coming to look for you. I've been thinking about what you said to the ChiefRabbit. Tell me, is it a sort of tremendous hoax to make yourself important, or isit true?""It is true," said Fiver. "I wish it weren't.""Then you'll be leaving the warren?"They were all startled by the bluntness with which Bigwig went to the point.
<br> Dandelion muttered, "Leave the warren, Frithrah!" while Blackberry twitched hisears and looked very intently, first at Bigwig and then at Hazel.
<br> It was Hazel who replied. "Fiver and I will be leaving the warren tonight," hesaid deliberately. "I don't know exactly where we shall go, but we'll take anyonewho's ready to come with us.""Right," said Bigwig, "then you can take me."The last thing Hazel had expected was the immediate support of a member ofthe Owsla. It crossed his mind that although Bigwig would certainly be a usefulrabbit in a tight corner, he would also be a difficult one to get on with. Hecertainly would not want to do what he was told -- or even asked -- by anoutskirter. "I don't care if he is in the Owsla," thought Hazel. "If we get away fromthe warren, I'm not going to let Bigwig run everything, or why bother to go?" Buthe answered only, "Good. We shall be glad to have you."He looked round at the other rabbits, who were all staring either at Bigwig orat himself. It was Blackberry who spoke next.
<br> "I think I'll come," he said. "I don't quite know whether it's you who'vepersuaded me, Fiver. But anyway, there are too many bucks in this warren, andit's pretty poor fun for any rabbit that's not in the Owsla. The funny thing is thatyou feel terrified to stay and I feel terrified to go. Foxes here, weasels there, Fiverin the middle, begone dull care!"He pulled out a burnet leaf and ate it slowly, concealing his fear as best hecould; for all his instincts were warning him of the dangers in the unknowncountry beyond the warren.
<br> "If we believe Fiver," said Hazel, "it means that we think no rabbits at all oughtto stay here. So between now and the time when we go, we ought to persuade asmany as we can to join us.""I think there are one or two in the Owsla who might be worth sounding," saidBigwig. "If I can talk them over, they'll be with me when I join you tonight. Butthey won't come because of Fiver. They'll be juniors, discontented fellows like me.
<br> You need to have heard Fiver yourself to be convinced by him. He's convincedme. It's obvious that he's been sent some kind of message, and I believe in thesethings. I can't think why he didn't convince the Threarah.""Because the Threarah doesn't like anything he hasn't thought of for himself,"answered Hazel. "But we can't bother with him any more now. We've got to try tocollect some more rabbits and meet again here, fu Inlé. And we'll start fu Inlé,too: we can't wait longer. The danger's coming closer all the time -- whatever it is-- and, besides, the Threarah isn't going to like it if he finds out that you've beentrying to get at rabbits in the Owsla, Bigwig. Neither is Captain Holly, I dare say.
<br> They won't mind odds and ends like us clearing off, but they won't want to loseyou. If I were in your place, I'd be careful whom I picked to talk to."
