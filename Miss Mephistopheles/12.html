NABALL TELLS A STORY.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      Kitty looked at him in silence with flashing eyes, and then laughed bitterly.
<br> 
<br> "And how long is it since you added the spy business to your usual work?" she asked, with a sneer on her colourless face.
<br> 
<br> "Since a few moments ago," replied Naball coolly. "I came to see you on business, and, hearing you in conversation with a lady, did not like to interrupt till you were disengaged."
<br> 
<br> "I'm very much obliged to you for your courtesy," said Caprice scornfully; "but now you have satisfied your curiosity. M. le Mouchard, I'll trouble you to take yourself off."
<br> 
<br> "Certainly, after I've had a few moments' conversation with you."
<br> 
<br> "I decline to listen," said Kitty haughtily.
<br> 
<br> "I think you had better," observed Naball significantly, "as it's about the robbery of your jewels."
<br> 
<br> "I forbade you to go on any further with that matter."
<br> 
<br> "You did; but I disobeyed your injunction."
<br> 
<br> "So I understand," replied Kitty indignantly; "and may I ask if you have discovered anything?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes--this!" and he showed the diamond crescent to Caprice. She started violently, and her pale face flushed a deep red.
<br> 
<br> "Where did you get it?" she asked.
<br> 
<br> "From Randolph Villiers."
<br> 
<br> "Villiers!" she echoed in surprise. "How did it come into his possession?"
<br> 
<br> "That is what I want to discover."
<br> 
<br> "Then you may save yourself the trouble, for you will never know."
<br> 
<br> "I understand that," said Naball quietly; "nothing can be done unless you permit me to go on."
<br> 
<br> "I forbid you to go on," she retorted angrily.
<br> 
<br> Naball bowed.
<br> 
<br> "Very well," he said quietly, "then there is nothing for me but to leave."
<br> 
<br> "No, I don't think there is," assented Kitty coldly, turning to re-enter the house.
<br> 
<br> "But, before I go," went on the detective, playing his great card, "I will leave your jewel with you."
<br> 
<br> "That," said Kitty, glancing over her shoulder at the crescent--"that is not mine."
<br> 
<br> "Mr. Fenton says it is."
<br> 
<br> "Mr. Fenton!" echoed Caprice jeeringly; "and how does Mr. Fenton know?"
<br> 
<br> "I should think he was the best person to know," retorted Naball, nettled at her mockery.
<br> 
<br> "A good many people think the same way," said Kitty disdainfully, "but in this case Mr. Fenton is wrong--I never saw those diamonds before."
<br> 
<br> "Then how did it come into Mr. Villiers' possession?"
<br> 
<br> "I don't know, not being in Mr. Villiers' confidence."
<br> 
<br> "Oh!" said Naball significantly, "you are quite certain you are not?"
<br> 
<br> "I don't understand you," replied Kitty coldly; "explain yourself."
<br> 
<br> "Certainly, if you wish it," said the detective smoothly. "I will tell it in the form of a little story--have I your permission to be seated?"
<br> 
<br> She nodded carelessly, whereupon Naball sat down on one of the lounging chairs, and, crossing his legs, settled himself composedly, while Kitty, standing near him with loosely-clasped hands, looked idly at the green lawn, with its brilliant border of many-coloured flowers.
<br> 
<br> "There was once a woman called Folly, who lived--let us say--in Cloudland--" began Naball airily.
<br> 
<br> "Rubbish!" said Kitty angrily.
<br> 
<br> "Nothing of the sort," retorted Naball coolly, "it is truth in disguise. I have been to school--I have read Spenser's 'Faery Queen'--if you please, we will consider this story, though not in verse, as one of the lost cantos of the poem."
<br> 
<br> Kitty shrugged her shoulders with contempt. "I think you're mad," she said coldly. "Perhaps I am," retorted Naball sharply, "but there's method in my madness, as you will soon find out--so, to go on with the lost canto of the 'Faery Queen.' This woman, Folly, was reputed to have a hard heart--no doubt she had, but there was one soft spot in it--love for her child. Many men loved this charming Folly, and paid dearly for the privilege. One man, misnamed Strength, loved her madly, and gave her many jewels. Strength had a friend, called Weakness, and though they were so dissimilar in character, they worked together. Weakness also loved Folly, though he had a wife, and, to gain Folly's love, he stole a lot of money. His wife discovered this, and going to Folly, implored her to help Weakness, but in vain, till at last she gained her point by appealing to the one soft spot in Folly's heart--love for her child. She was successful, and Folly promised to save the husband by replacing the money, which she could do through the agency of Strength, who was her lover.
<br> 
<br> "Folly, however, did not know where to get the money, so, in despair, determined to part with her jewels. She dared not do so openly, lest the inhabitants of Cloudland should find out what Weakness had done, so she enlisted the services of a man called Vice. Here," said Naball gaily, "we will leave the narrative style, and finish the story dramatically."
<br> 
<br> Kitty, who had grown pale, made no sign, so Naball resumed.
<br> 
<br> "Scene, a supper-room, with a window open--time, night--supper ended--guests away--enter Vice through open window--helps himself to champagne. Folly, informed of presence of Vice, enters the room and orders him out--he refuses to leave till he gets money--she refuses to give it to him. Suddenly an idea strikes her, and she tells Vice she will give him money if he sells her jewels for her secretly--Vice consents. Folly goes up to her room, gets jewels, gives them to Vice, who goes away and breaks down shrubs under window, which is opened by Folly to show every one that a burglar has stolen the jewels. Rumours of the theft get about--Bloodhound goes on the track--traces Vice to his den--finds one jewel--comes to show it to Folly--overhears wife of Weakness thanking Folly for replacing money stolen by her husband--exit wife of Weakness--enter Bloodhound to Folly, who denies having ever seen jewel before. Bloodhound tells a story to Folly, which Folly--"
<br> 
<br> "Denies, yes, denies!" broke in Kitty angrily; "your story is wrong."
<br> 
<br> "Pardon me," said Naball, rising, "allegorical."
<br> 
<br> "I can understand what you mean," said Kitty, after a pause; "but it's all wrong. I never paid this money for Malton."
<br> 
<br> "Pardon me,--Weakness," said Naball politely.
<br> 
<br> "Bah! why keep up this transparent deception? Your story is excellent, and I understand all about Folly, Vice, and Strength, but you are wrong--that jewel is not mine. I never paid the money, and I don't know anything about Malton's business, so you can leave me at once, and never show your face again."
<br> 
<br> "But the jewel?" said the detective, holding it out.
<br> 
<br> Kitty snatched it out of his hand, and flung it across the lawn. It flashed brilliantly in the sunlight, and fell just on the verge of the flower-bed.
<br> 
<br> "You can follow it,--Bloodhound," she said disdainfully, and, entering the house, closed the window after her.
<br> 
<br> Naball stood for a moment smiling in a gratified manner to himself, then, sauntering slowly across the lawn, picked up the jewel and replaced it in his pocket.
<br> 
<br> "I knew I was right," he murmured quietly, as he strolled to the gate; "she stole the diamonds to pay Malton's debt, and Villiers got this for payment as an accomplice. I wish I could get on with the case, but she won't let me--what a pity; dear, dear, what a pity!"
<br> 
<br> He had by this time reached the gate, and was passing through it, when a hansom drove up, from out which Fenton jumped.
<br> 
<br> "Well?" he asked, when he saw Naball.
<br> 
<br> "Well," said Naball, dusting his varnished boots with a silk handkerchief.
<br> 
<br> "What does she say?" asked Fenton inquiringly
<br> 
<br> "What a woman generally does say--everything but the truth. Going to see her?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes," said Fenton, paying his cab fare; "can T do anything?"
<br> 
<br> "Two things," observed Naball quietly: "in the first place, let me have your cab; and in the second, give this to Caprice with my compliments," and he handed the crescent of diamonds to Fenton.
<br> 
<br> "Why didn't you give it to her yourself?" asked Fenton, taking it.
<br> 
<br> "Because she said it wasn't hers," replied Naball, getting into the cab. "I can't do anything more in the matter; it's a beautiful case spoiled."
<br> 
<br> "Why spoiled?" asked Fenton, pausing at the gate.
<br> 
<br> "Because there's a woman in it," replied Naball; "good-bye!" and the cab drove off in a cloud of dust, leaving Fenton at the gate looking in a puzzled manner at the diamond crescent.
<br> 
<br> "Why the deuce did she deny this being hers?" he asked himself as he opened the gate. "I know it well--I ought to, considering I paid for it--there's some game in this."
<br> 
<br> He rang the bell, which was answered by Bliggings, who, in reply to his question as to whether Kitty was at home, burst out into a volley of language.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, gracious an' good 'eavens, missus 'ave bin talkin' to a lady this mornin', and is that upset as never was--chalk is black to her complexing, and penny hices 'ot to the chill of her feets."
<br> 
<br> "Humph!" said Fenton, entering the house and leisurely taking off his hat, "just tell your mistress I want to see her."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, gracious an' good 'eavens!" cried Bliggings, "she's a-lyin' down in company with a linseed poultase an' a cup of tea, both bein' good for removin' 'eadaches."
<br> 
<br> "Great Scot!" said Fenton impatiently, pushing the voluble Bliggings aside, "I'll go and see her straight off myself."
<br> 
<br> He went upstairs and knocked at the sitting-room door. Hearing a faint voice telling him to come in, he entered the room, which he found in semi-darkness, with the pungent aroma of eau de cologne pervading the atmosphere.
<br> 
<br> "What do you want?" asked Kitty fretfully, thinking it was the servant.
<br> 
<br> "To see you," replied Fenton gruffly.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, it's you!" cried Caprice, sitting up on the sofa, looking pale and wan in her white dress. "I'm glad of that--I've just seen that Naball, and he's been accusing me of stealing my own jewels."
<br> 
<br> "Well, did you?" asked Fenton complacently.
<br> 
<br> "Of course I didn't," she retorted angrily; "why should I? Naball thinks I did it to replace the money Malton stole."
<br> 
<br> "How did he find out that?" asked Fenton, who knew quite well he had told him about it himself.
<br> 
<br> "He overheard Mrs. Malton thanking me," retorted Kitty impatiently; "the money has been replaced, so I suppose, you did it."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, I did," said Fenton boldly, "for your sake."
<br> 
<br> "You're a good fellow, Fenton," said Kitty, in a softened tone. "I'm glad you did what I asked you--now, go away, for I must get a sleep, or I'll never be able to act to-night."
<br> 
<br> "But what about this jewel?" asked Fenton, taking the crescent out of his pocket. "Naball said you denied it being yours."
<br> 
<br> "So I did," replied Caprice pettishly.
<br> 
<br> "But why? I gave it to you."
<br> 
<br> "Well, you can give it to me again," she said coolly. "Put it on the table, and go away."
<br> 
<br> Fenton thought a moment, then, going over to the table, placed the jewel thereon, and turned once more to Caprice.
<br> 
<br> "Look here, Kitty," he said slowly, "did you do anything with those diamonds?"
<br> 
<br> "Perhaps I did, and perhaps I didn't," replied Caprice enigmatically; "at all events, I'm not going to have any more fuss made over them."
<br> 
<br> "Well, good-bye at present," said Fenton carelessly. "I say, you might give me a kiss, after fixing up Malton's affair."
<br> 
<br> "So I will--at the theatre to-night. Do leave me, my head is so bad."
<br> 
<br> "Not so bad as you are, you little devil," murmured Fenton, closing the sitting-room door softly after him. "Well, I guess there'll be no more trouble about those diamonds, at all events."
