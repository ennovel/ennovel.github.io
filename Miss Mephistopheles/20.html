THE RIVALS.</h1>  </div>  <div class="row">    <div class="col-xs-12">      Eugénie Rainsford was a very clever young woman, much too clever to pass her life in the up-country wilds of Australia, and no doubt she would have left her solitude in some way even had not fortune favoured her. Luckily, however, fortune did favour her and in a rather curious way, for a rich sharebroker having seen her, fell in love with her, and wanted to marry her; she however refused, telling him that she was engaged to marry Keith Stewart, whereupon he made inquiries, and she told him the whole story.
<br> 
<br> He was so delighted with her fidelity to a poor man, that he made his will in her favour, feeling sure that, as he had no relations, she would be the most deserving person to leave it to. A carriage accident killed him six months afterwards, and Eugénie found herself a very rich woman, with as many thousands as she had pence before.
<br> 
<br> She took her good fortune very calmly, telling no one about it, not even her employers; but, after consultation with the lawyer, she sent five hundred pounds to Keith, with instructions to the bank that he was not to know where it came from. Then she set herself to work out a little scheme she had in her head, to find out if he were true to her.
<br> 
<br> In many of the letters he had written, she had been struck with the frequent mention of one name, Caprice, and on making inquiries, found out all about the actress. She bought a photograph of her, and was struck with the pathetic face of a woman who was said to lead so vile a life. Dreading lest Keith should have fallen in love with this divinity of the stage, she determined to go down to Melbourne and see for herself.
<br> 
<br> By chance, however, she found in a newspaper an advertisement that Kitty Marchurst wanted a governess for her little girl, and seeing at once an excellent opportunity of finding out if her suspicions were correct, wrote offering herself for the situation.
<br> 
<br> Kitty on her side remembered the name of Eugénie Rainsford as that of the girl to whom Keith told her he was engaged, so, curious to see what she was like, engaged her for a governess at once. Eugénie was delighted when she received this letter, and, still in the character of a poor and friendless girl, she left Mr. Chine, the lawyer, to manage her property, after binding him to secrecy, and came down to take the situation.
<br> 
<br> Keith's evident desire that she should not accept the situation made her all the more determined to do so, and twelve o'clock the next day found her in the drawing-room of Caprice's house, waiting for the entrance of her future mistress.
<br> 
<br> When Kitty entered the room she could not help admiring the handsome woman before her, and on her part Eugénie was astonished to see the bright vivacity of the melancholy face, for Caprice's features were sad only when in repose.
<br> 
<br> The two women stood opposite to one another for a moment, mentally making up their minds about each other. Kitty was the first to speak.
<br> 
<br> "Miss Rainsford, I believe?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes; I came to see you about--about the situation."
<br> 
<br> "Governess for my little girl," said Kitty, nodding her head. "Yes, I want some one whom I can trust."
<br> 
<br> "I hope you will be able to trust me."
<br> 
<br> Caprice looked keenly at her, and then burst out into a torrent of words.
<br> 
<br> "Yes, I think I can trust you--but the question is, will you take care of my child--I mean will you accept the trust? You have come from the country--you don't know who I am?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, I do--Miss Marchurst."
<br> 
<br> "No! not Miss Marchurst--Caprice!"
<br> 
<br> She waited for a moment to see what effect this notorious name would have on her visitor, but, to her surprise, Eugénie simply bowed.
<br> 
<br> "Yes, I know," she replied.
<br> 
<br> Caprice arose and advanced towards her.
<br> 
<br> "You know," she exclaimed vehemently, "and yet can sit down in the same room with a woman of my character. Are you not afraid I'll contaminate you--do you not shrink from a pariah like me--no--you do not--great heavens!" with a bitter laugh, sitting down again; "and I thought the age of miracles was past--ah, bah! But you are only a girl, my dear, and don't understand."
<br> 
<br> Eugénie arose and crossed over to her.
<br> 
<br> "I do understand; I am a woman, and feel for a woman."
<br> 
<br> Kitty caught her hand and gave a gasping cry. "God bless you!" she whispered, in a husky voice.
<br> 
<br> Then in a moment she had dashed the tears away from her eyes, and sat up again in her bright, resolute manner.
<br> 
<br> "No woman has spoken so kindly as you have for many years," she said quickly; "and I thank you. I can give you my child, and you will take care of her for me when I am far away."
<br> 
<br> "What do you mean?" asked Eugénie, puzzled.
<br> 
<br> "Mean--that I am not fit to live with my child, that I am going to send her to England with you, that she may forget she ever had a mother."
<br> 
<br> "But why do this," said Eugénie in a pitying tone, "when you can keep her with you?"
<br> 
<br> "I cannot let her grow up in the atmosphere of sin I live in."
<br> 
<br> "Then why not leave this sinful life, and go to England with your child?"
<br> 
<br> Kitty shook her head with a dreary smile.
<br> 
<br> "Impossible--to leave off this life would kill me; besides, I saw a doctor some time ago, and he told me I had not very long to live; there is something wrong with my heart. I don't care if I do die so long as my child is safe--you will look after her?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes," replied Eugénie firmly; "I will look after her."
<br> 
<br> Kitty approached her timidly.
<br> 
<br> "May I kiss you?" she said faintly, and seeing her answer in the girl's eyes, she bent down and kissed her forehead.
<br> 
<br> "Now I must introduce you to your new pupil," she said, cheerfully overcoming her momentary weakness.
<br> 
<br> "Wait a moment," said Eugénie, as Caprice went to the bell-pull. "I want to ask you about Mr. Stewart."
<br> 
<br> Caprice turned round quickly.
<br> 
<br> "Yes--what--about him?"
<br> 
<br> "Does he love you?"
<br> 
<br> Caprice came over to the fire and looked closely at her.
<br> 
<br> "You are the girl he is engaged to?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes."
<br> 
<br> "Then, make your mind easy, my dear, he loves no one but you."
<br> 
<br> Eugénie gave a sigh of relief, at which Kitty smiled a little scornfully.
<br> 
<br> "Ah! you love him so much as that?" she said half pathetically; "it's a pity, my dear, he's not worth it."
<br> 
<br> "What do you mean?"
<br> 
<br> "Don't be angry, Miss Rainsford," said Kitty, quietly; "I don't mean that he loves any one else, but he's not the man I took him for."
<br> 
<br> "I don't understand."
<br> 
<br> "I wouldn't try to, if I were you," replied Kitty significantly. "I helped him when I first met him, because he saved my child's life. He came down here, and I liked him still more."
<br> 
<br> "You loved him?"
<br> 
<br> "No; love and I parted company long ago. I liked him, but though I do my best to help him, I don't care for him so much as I did, my dear: he's not worthy of you."
<br> 
<br> "That's all very well, but I don't see the reason."
<br> 
<br> "Of course not, what woman in love ever does see reason; however, make your mind easy, things are all right. I will tell you the reason some day."
<br> 
<br> "But I want to know now."
<br> 
<br> "Curiosity is a woman's vice," said Kitty lightly "Don't worry yourself, Miss Rainsford, whatever I know of Keith Stewart won't alter him in your eyes--now, don't say anything more about it. I'll ring for Meg."
<br> 
<br> Eugénie tried to get a more explicit answer out of her, but Kitty only laughed.
<br> 
<br> "It can't be anything so very bad," she said to herself, "or this woman would not laugh at it."
<br> 
<br> Meg came in quietly, a demure, pensive-faced little child, and after Kitty had kissed her she presented her to Eugénie.
<br> 
<br> "This is your new governess, Meg," she said, smoothing the child's hair, "and I want you to love her very much."
<br> 
<br> Meg hung back for a few moments, with the awkward timidity of a child, but Eugénie's soft voice and caressing manner soon gained her confidence.
<br> 
<br> "I like you very much," she said at length, nestling to Eugénie's side.
<br> 
<br> "As much as mumsey, Meg?" said Kitty, with a sad smile.
<br> 
<br> "Oh, never--never as much as mumsey," cried Meg, leaving her new-found friend for her mother, "There's no one so good and kind as mumsey."
<br> 
<br> Kitty kissed the child vehemently, and then bit her lips to stop the tears coming to her eyes.
<br> 
<br> "Mumsey," said Meg at length, "can I tell the lady a secret?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, dear," replied Kitty smiling. Thereupon Meg slipped off Kitty's lap and ran to Eugénie.
<br> 
<br> "What is this great secret?" asked Eugénie, bending down with a laugh.
<br> 
<br> Meg put her mouth to Eugénie's ear, and whispered,--
<br> 
<br> "When I grow up I'm going to marry Keith."
<br> 
<br> "You see," said Kitty, overhearing the whisper, "my daughter is your rival."
<br> 
<br> "And a very dangerous one," replied Eugénie with a sigh, touching the auburn hair.
<br> 
<br> Meg was sent off after this, and then Kitty arranged all about the salary with Eugénie, after which she accompanied her to the door to say good-bye.
<br> 
<br> "I'm sorry I put any distrust into your heart about Mr. Stewart," she said; "but don't trouble, my dear, get him to give up his dissipated habits, and you'll no doubt find he'll make an excellent husband."
<br> 
<br> "Ah!" said Eugénie to herself as she walked to the station, "it was only dissipation she meant--as if anything like that could hurt Keith in my eyes."
<br> 
<br> Then she began to think of the strange woman she had left--with her sudden changes of temperament from laughter to tears--with her extraordinary nature, half-vice half-virtue, of the love she bore for her child, and the strong will that could send that child away for ever from her lonely life.
