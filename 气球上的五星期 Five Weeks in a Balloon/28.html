<p>The evening was lovely, and our three friends enjoyed it in the cool shade of the mimosas, after a substantial repast, at which the tea and the punch were dealt out with no niggardly hand.</p> 
<p>Kennedy had traversed the little domain in all directions. He had ransacked every thicket and satisfied himself that the balloon party were the only living creatures in this terrestrial paradise; so they stretched themselves upon their blankets and passed a peaceful night that brought them forgetfulness of their past sufferings.</p> 
<p>On the morrow, May 7th, the sun shone with all his splendor, but his rays could not penetrate the dense screen of the palm-tree foliage, and as there was no lack of provisions, the doctor resolved to remain where he was while waiting for a favorable wind.</p> 
<p>Joe had conveyed his portable kitchen to the oasis, and proceeded to indulge in any number of culinary combinations, using water all the time with the most profuse extravagance.</p> 
<p>"What a strange succession of annoyances and enjoyments!" moralized Kennedy. "Such abundance as this after such privations; such luxury after such want! Ah! I nearly went mad!"</p> 
<p>"My dear Dick," replied the doctor, "had it not been for Joe, you would not be sitting here, to-day, discoursing on the instability of human affairs."</p> 
<p>"Whole-hearted friend!" said Kennedy, extending his hand to Joe.</p> 
<p>"There's no occasion for all that," responded the latter; "but you can take your revenge some time, Mr. Kennedy, always hoping though that you may never have occasion to do the same for me!"</p> 
<p>"It's a poor constitution this of ours to succumb to so little," philosophized Dr. Ferguson.</p> 
<p>"So little water, you mean, doctor," interposed Joe; "that element must be very necessary to life."</p> 
<p>"Undoubtedly, and persons deprived of food hold out longer than those deprived of water."</p> 
<p>"I believe it. Besides, when needs must, one can eat any thing he comes across, even his fellow-creatures, although that must be a kind of food that's pretty hard to digest."</p> 
<p>"The savages don't boggle much about it!" said Kennedy.</p> 
<p>"Yes; but then they are savages, and accustomed to devouring raw meat; it's something that I'd find very disgusting, for my part."</p> 
<p>"It is disgusting enough," said the doctor, "that's a fact; and so much so, indeed, that nobody believed the narratives of the earliest travellers in Africa who brought back word that many tribes on that continent subsisted upon raw meat, and people generally refused to credit the statement. It was under such circumstances that a very singular adventure befell James Bruce."</p> 
<p>"Tell it to us, doctor; we've time enough to hear it," said Joe, stretching himself voluptuously on the cool greensward.</p> 
<p>"By all means.--James Bruce was a Scotchman, of Stirlingshire, who, between 1768 and 1772, traversed all Abyssinia, as far as Lake Tyana, in search of the sources of the Nile. He afterward returned to England, but did not publish an account of his journeys until 1790. His statements were received with extreme incredulity, and such may be the reception accorded to our own. The manners and customs of the Abyssinians seemed so different from those of the English, that no one would credit the description of them. Among other details, Bruce had put forward the assertion that the tribes of Eastern Africa fed upon raw flesh, and this set everybody against him. He might say so as much as he pleased; there was no one likely to go and see! One day, in a parlor at Edinburgh, a Scotch gentleman took up the subject in his presence, as it had become the topic of daily pleasantry, and, in reference to the eating of raw flesh, said that the thing was neither possible nor true. Bruce made no reply, but went out and returned a few minutes later with a raw steak, seasoned with pepper and salt, in the African style.</p> 
<p>"'Sir,' said he to the Scotchman, 'in doubting my statements, you have grossly affronted me; in believing the thing to be impossible, you have been egregiously mistaken; and, in proof thereof, you will now eat this beef-steak raw, or you will give me instant satisfaction!' The Scotchman had a wholesome dread of the brawny traveller, and DID eat the steak, although not without a good many wry faces. Thereupon, with the utmost coolness, James Bruce added: 'Even admitting, sir, that the thing were untrue, you will, at least, no longer maintain that it is impossible.'"</p> 
<p>"Well put in!" said Joe, "and if the Scotchman found it lie heavy on his stomach, he got no more than he deserved. If, on our return to England, they dare to doubt what we say about our travels--"</p> 
<p>"Well, Joe, what would you do?"</p> 
<p>"Why, I'll make the doubters swallow the pieces of the balloon, without either salt or pepper!"</p> 
<p>All burst out laughing at Joe's queer notions, and thus the day slipped by in pleasant chat. With returning strength, hope had revived, and with hope came the courage to do and to dare. The past was obliterated in the presence of the future with providential rapidity.</p> 
<p>Joe would have been willing to remain forever in this enchanting asylum; it was the realm he had pictured in his dreams; he felt himself at home; his master had to give him his exact location, and it was with the gravest air imaginable that he wrote down on his tablets fifteen degrees forty-three minutes east longitude, and eight degrees thirty-two minutes north latitude.</p> 
<p>Kennedy had but one regret, to wit, that he could not hunt in that miniature forest, because, according to his ideas, there was a slight deficiency of ferocious wild beasts in it.</p> 
<p>"But, my dear Dick," said the doctor, "haven't you rather a short memory? How about the lion and the lioness?"</p> 
<p>"Oh, that!" he ejaculated with the contempt of a thorough-bred sportsman for game already killed. "But the fact is, that finding them here would lead one to suppose that we can't be far from a more fertile country."</p> 
<p>"It don't prove much, Dick, for those animals, when goaded by hunger or thirst, will travel long distances, and I think that, to-night, we had better keep a more vigilant lookout, and light fires, besides."</p> 
<p>"What, in such heat as this?" said Joe. "Well, if it's necessary, we'll have to do it, but I do think it a real pity to burn this pretty grove that has been such a comfort to us!"</p> 
<p>"Oh! above all things, we must take the utmost care not to set it on fire," replied the doctor, "so that others in the same strait as ourselves may some day find shelter here in the middle of the desert."</p> 
<p>"I'll be very careful, indeed, doctor; but do you think that this oasis is known?"</p> 
<p>"Undoubtedly; it is a halting-place for the caravans that frequent the centre of Africa, and a visit from one of them might be any thing but pleasant to you, Joe."</p> 
<p>"Why, are there any more of those rascally Nyam-Nyams around here?"</p> 
<p>"Certainly; that is the general name of all the neighboring tribes, and, under the same climates, the same races are likely to have similar manners and customs."</p> 
<p>"Pah!" said Joe, "but, after all, it's natural enough. If savages had the ways of gentlemen, where would be the difference? By George, these fine fellows wouldn't have to be coaxed long to eat the Scotchman's raw steak, nor the Scotchman either, into the bargain!"</p> 
<p>With this very sensible observation, Joe began to get ready his firewood for the night, making just as little of it as possible. Fortunately, these precautions were superfluous; and each of the party, in his turn, dropped off into the soundest slumber.</p> 
<p>On the next day the weather still showed no sign of change, but kept provokingly and obstinately fair. The balloon remained motionless, without any oscillation to betray a breath of wind.</p> 
<p>The doctor began to get uneasy again. If their stay in the desert were to be prolonged like this, their provisions would give out. After nearly perishing for want of water, they would, at last, have to starve to death!</p> 
<p>But he took fresh courage as he saw the mercury fall considerably in the barometer, and noticed evident signs of an early change in the atmosphere. He therefore resolved to make all his preparations for a start, so as to avail himself of the first opportunity. The feeding-tank and the water-tank were both completely filled.</p> 
<p>Then he had to reestablish the equilibrium of the balloon, and Joe was obliged to part with another considerable portion of his precious quartz. With restored health, his ambitious notions had come back to him, and he made more than one wry face before obeying his master; but the latter convinced him that he could not carry so considerable a weight with him through the air, and gave him his choice between the water and the gold. Joe hesitated no longer, but flung out the requisite quantity of his much-prized ore upon the sand.</p> 
<p>"The next people who come this way," he remarked, "will be rather surprised to find a fortune in such a place."</p> 
<p>"And suppose some learned traveller should come across these specimens, eh?" suggested Kennedy.</p> 
<p>"You may be certain, Dick, that they would take him by surprise, and that he would publish his astonishment in several folios; so that some day we shall hear of a wonderful deposit of gold-bearing quartz in the midst of the African sands!"</p> 
<p>"And Joe there, will be the cause of it all!"</p> 
<p>This idea of mystifying some learned sage tickled Joe hugely, and made him laugh.</p> 
<p>During the rest of the day the doctor vainly kept on the watch for a change of weather. The temperature rose, and, had it not been for the shade of the oasis, would have been insupportable. The thermometer marked a hundred and forty-nine degrees in the sun, and a veritable rain of fire filled the air. This was the most intense heat that they had yet noted.</p> 
<p>Joe arranged their bivouac for that evening, as he had done for the previous night; and during the watches kept by the doctor and Kennedy there was no fresh incident.</p> 
<p>But, toward three o'clock in the morning, while Joe was on guard, the temperature suddenly fell; the sky became overcast with clouds, and the darkness increased.</p> 
<p>"Turn out!" cried Joe, arousing his companions. "Turn out! Here's the wind!"</p> 
<p>"At last!" exclaimed the doctor, eying the heavens. "But it is a storm! The balloon! Let us hasten to the balloon!"</p> 
<p>It was high time for them to reach it. The Victoria was bending to the force of the hurricane, and dragging along the car, the latter grazing the sand. Had any portion of the ballast been accidentally thrown out, the balloon would have been swept away, and all hope of recovering it have been forever lost.</p> 
<p>But fleet-footed Joe put forth his utmost speed, and checked the car, while the balloon beat upon the sand, at the risk of being torn to pieces. The doctor, followed by Kennedy, leaped in, and lit his cylinder, while his companions threw out the superfluous ballast.</p> 
<p>The travellers took one last look at the trees of the oasis bowing to the force of the hurricane, and soon, catching the wind at two hundred feet above the ground, disappeared in the gloom.</p> 
<p>美妙的夜晚——乔的烹调手艺——谈论吃生肉——詹姆士·布鲁斯的故事——露营——乔的梦想——气压表下降——气压表上升——出发前的准备——飓风</p> 
<p>饱餐了一顿营养丰富的晚饭，并痛痛快快地享用了大量的茶和烈酒后，三位旅行家在合欢树清凉的树阴下，度过了一个美好的夜晚。</p> 
<p>当然，肯尼迪从不同的方向踏遍了这小块绿洲，并仔细搜索了每一簇灌木丛。最后，旅行家们确认，他们是这块人间天堂中唯一的生物。他们舒展手脚躺在铺盖上，放心大胆地度过了祥和的一夜。这一夜使他们忘却了刚刚经历过的苦难。</p> 
<p>第二天是5月7日，太阳最大限度地释放着光芒，然而，阳光还是无法穿透厚厚幕帘似的树叶。由于这儿有足够的食物和水，博士决定暂时留下等有了合适的风再动身。</p> 
<p>乔从吊篮里搬来了他的行军灶。他一心一意做起各种美味佳肴，向大家展示他那高超的烹饪技艺。他哗哗地用着水，再也不必担心浪费了。</p> 
<p>“一会儿忧愁悲伤，一会儿欢天喜地，多么奇特的轮转交替啊！”肯尼迪感慨万分，“绝后又逢生，苦尽甘又来，穷极骤富裕，人生何其怪！唉！我那时几乎都疯了！”</p> 
<p>“亲爱的肯尼迪，”博士安慰他，“如果不是乔，你也就不会在这儿大谈什么人生的变幻不定了。”</p> 
<p>“谢谢你，忠诚的朋友！”狄克·肯尼迪说着，把手伸给乔。</p> 
<p>“没什么可谢的。”乔回答说，“肯尼迪先生，说不定哪一天你会救我的。不过，我可宁愿不再碰上这样的事。”</p> 
<p>“说起来，我们的天性也真够脆弱的，因为芝麻粒大的事，自己就垮了！”博士说道。</p> 
<p>“主人，您的意思是说，喝不上水是芝麻粒大的事？应该说，水是生活中必不可少的呀！”</p> 
<p>“毫无疑问是这样，乔。人不吃东西要比不喝水活的日子长。”</p> 
<p>“这我倒相信。再说，万不得已时，人可以逮到什么吃什么，甚至吃自己同类的肉，尽管这种饭留在肚子里不好消化，可到那时，不吃也得吃！”</p> 
<p>“不过，野人并不认为吃人肉是不好的事。”肯尼迪说。</p> 
<p>“对嘛，所以他们是野人呀。他们还习惯吃生肉哩。这种习俗真让我恶心！”</p> 
<p>“的确让人恶心，所以最初来非洲考察的旅行家们讲述此事时，才会没有人相信。”博士证实道，“当初，那些旅行家报告说，非洲好多部落吃生肉。可是，人们普遍不愿承认这个事实。就是在这种情况下，詹姆士·布鲁斯意外经历了一件特别的事。”</p> 
<p>“先生，您给我们讲讲吧，反正我们有时间。”乔请求说。他舒展着双手和双脚，在清新的草地上躺着，心里非常惬意。</p> 
<p>“好吧， 我就讲讲： 詹姆士·布鲁斯是苏格兰斯特灵郡①人。他在1768年到1772年间，走遍了直到提亚那湖的整个阿比西尼亚去寻找尼罗河源头。后来，他返回了英国。1790年，他才发表了他的游记。当时，他的报导受到了人们的极度怀疑。顺便说一句，我们的游记以后发表了，肯定也会受到怀疑。阿比西尼亚人的风俗习惯与英国人的差别极大，以至于没人愿相信他的话。在详述非洲人的生活时，他提到非洲人吃生肉。这件事招致了所有人的反对，说他明知道不会有人去验证，所以只管信口开河，乱说一气。布鲁斯是位非常有胆量，同时又非常急躁的人，这些无端怀疑使他气极生怒。一天，在爱丁堡的一个沙龙里，一位苏格兰人当着他的面又拿这件事开玩笑。这位怀疑论者明确表示，有关吃生肉一事，既不可能也不真实。布鲁斯听后，什么也没有说。他出去了一会儿，回来时带了一块按非洲方式撒了盐和胡椒粉的生牛排，他对那位苏格兰人说：‘先生，既然您怀疑我说的事，就是对我的莫大侮辱。您认为这事做不到，那您完全错了。因此，为了向所有在场的人表明您错了，您必须马上把这块生牛排吃了。要么，您就得把您说过的话给我解释清楚。’苏格兰人害怕了，最后，只好一脸苦相地把生牛排吃了下去。而这时，镇定自若的詹姆士·布鲁斯又补充了一句：‘先生，既然承认事情不是真的，至少您就不要再坚持事情不可能。’”</p> 
<p>①英国苏格兰中部城市，中央区首府。</p> 
<p>“真是绝妙的反击。”乔夸赞道，“那个苏格兰人要是得了消化不良症，也只能怪他咎由自取了。如果我们回到伦敦时，有人怀疑我们的旅行……。”</p> 
<p>“那么，乔，你怎么办？”</p> 
<p>“我会让那些怀疑论者们把‘维多利亚号’撕碎了吞下去，而且还不放盐和胡椒粉！”</p> 
<p>乔的方法把大家都逗笑了。一个白天就这样在愉悦的谈话中度过了。随着精力的恢复，大家又产生了希望，有了希望也就有了勇气，过去的很快就过去了，未来就在面前。</p> 
<p>乔一点儿不想离开这个迷人的避难地，声称这是他梦想中的王国，觉得在这儿就和在家似的。在他的一再央求下，博士为他测算了这块绿洲的精确方位。乔郑重其事地在他的旅行图表上记下：东经15度43分，北纬8度32分。</p> 
<p>肯尼迪只有一件事觉得惋惜，那就是在这个微型树林中，没猎可打。照他的看法，这儿什么都好，就是野兽少了点。</p> 
<p>“不过，亲爱的肯尼迪，”博士又说，“你怎么转眼就忘了呢？你不记得那只雄狮和那只母狮了？”</p> 
<p>“嗨！那不值一提！”他带着一个真正的猎人对被打死的动物不屑一顾的样子，说，“不过，在这块绿洲上出现狮子，毕竟可以使我们猜到，我们离肥沃地区已不远了。”</p> 
<p>“你这个证据可不怎么样，肯尼迪。像这种动物，如果受饥渴驱使，常常可以跑很远一程路。今天晚上，我们最好多加小心，另外，再点上几堆篝火。”</p> 
<p>“这么热的天还点篝火？”乔很不情愿，“不过，如果真有必要，那就点吧。可是，万一把这么美的一棵树烧着了，我会觉得良心很不安的。要知道，它对我们有过多少用处啊。”</p> 
<p>“你说的不错，乔。我们要特别小心，别把树烧了，这样，别的人有一天也能根据这棵树找到沙漠中的这块救命之地。”</p> 
<p>“先生，会当心的。您认为别人知道这块绿洲吗？”</p> 
<p>“肯定知道。这是经常出入非洲中心的那些骆驼商队的歇息地。不过他们的拜访不会使你高兴的，乔。”</p> 
<p>“这附近也有那些可怕的尼阿姆—尼阿姆人吗？”</p> 
<p>“当然了，那是这里所有居民的通称。而且，生活在相同气候下的同一种族的人，风俗习惯也是相同的。”</p> 
<p>“呸！”乔厌恶地唾了一口，“这事毕竟很正常！如果野人有了绅士的趣味，那野人和绅士还有什么区别？相反，那些诚实的人会不用请就把苏格兰人的牛排给吞吃了，甚至连那位苏格兰人也会给搭上。”</p> 
<p>出于这番非常明智的考虑，乔去搭了一些夜里用的柴堆，并尽可能把柴堆搭小点。所幸的是这些担心是多余的，一夜平安无事，每人轮流睡了个好觉。</p> 
<p>第二天，天气仍没有变化，依然是晴空万里。气球悬在那儿一动不动，空中连一丝风也没有。博士又担忧起来。如果旅行不得不这样拖延下去，吃的东西很快就会不够了。前两天因缺水差点儿渴死，难道现在又要被逼到饿死的地步？可是，看到气压表上的水银柱明显下降，他又心安了一些。许多迹象明显表明，最近天气要发生变化。他决定做好出发前的准备工作，以便一刮风马上可以飞走。于是，供气箱和水箱全都装满了水。</p> 
<p>之后，弗格森着手恢复气球的平衡。这么一来，乔又不得不牺牲很大一部分宝贵的金矿石。随着身体的恢复，乔的私心杂念又萌生了。他满脸的苦相，迟迟不想执行主人的命令。博士见状，给他指出气球带这么重的东西不可能飞起来，要水还是要金子，两条路由他选。乔不再犹豫了，立即动手把他那些宝贵的石头扔掉了许多。</p> 
<p>“这些金子留给后来的人吧。”他不无心疼地说，“在这儿发现一笔财宝，他们一定很惊奇的。”</p> 
<p>“嗨！要是凑巧哪位博学的旅行家碰到了这些金矿石呢？……”</p> 
<p>“亲爱的肯尼迪，你相信好了，他肯定非常吃惊，而且，会把他的意外发现写上好几页拿来发表。总有一天，我们会听说非洲沙漠里发现了一个不可思议的金矿。”</p> 
<p>“这都是乔干的好事。”</p> 
<p>一想到或许会愚弄某位学者，乔的心里好受了些，脸上不觉地露出了笑容。</p> 
<p>一切准备就绪。余下的时间里，博士眼巴巴地等待着空气发生变化。然而，气温在继续升高，要不是待在绿洲上的树荫下，人会热得受不了。温度计在阳光下显示， 气温高达华氏149度（69摄氏度）。天在下着一场名副其实的火雨。这一天的温度是他们旅行以来最高的了。</p> 
<p>晚上，乔像头一天一样准备了篝火。在博士和肯尼迪值班的时间里，没有任何事情发生。 将近凌晨3点时，正在值班的乔发现温度骤然下降，空中很快布满了乌云，天也变得更黑了。</p> 
<p>“快起来！”乔喊醒两位同伴，“快起来！起风了！”</p> 
<p>“终于等到了！”博士观察着天空说，“还是一场暴风呢！我们快上‘维多利亚号’！”</p> 
<p>他们到的正是时候，在飓风的狂吹下，气球几乎贴了地，吊篮被拖在沙地上跑。万一部分压载物不巧被抛出了吊篮，气球就会离地而去。果真如此的话，根本不可能再找回来，整个希望也就彻底破灭了。</p> 
<p>幸亏敏捷的乔飞快跑来，死死按住了吊篮。这时，气球已经贴住了沙地，随时可能被划破。博士立即来到他习惯的位置上，点燃氢氧喷嘴，同时扔掉多余的重物。</p> 
<p>3位旅行家最后望了一眼绿洲上被飓风刮弯了腰的树木。气球很快升入离地200尺高的气流中。转眼间，“维多利亚号”在漆黑的夜空里消失了。</p>
