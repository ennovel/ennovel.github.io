<p>At five o'clock in the morning, preparations for departure commenced. Joe, with the hatchet which he had fortunately recovered, broke the elephant's tusks. The balloon, restored to liberty, sped away to the northwest with our travellers, at the rate of eighteen miles per hour.</p> 
<p>The doctor had carefully taken his position by the altitude of the stars, during the preceding night. He knew that he was in latitude two degrees forty minutes below the equator, or at a distance of one hundred and sixty geographical miles. He swept along over many villages without heeding the cries that the appearance of the balloon excited; he took note of the conformation of places with quick sights; he passed the slopes of the Rubemhe, which are nearly as abrupt as the summits of the Ousagara, and, farther on, at Tenga, encountered the first projections of the Karagwah chains, which, in his opinion, are direct spurs of the Mountains of the Moon. So, the ancient legend which made these mountains the cradle of the Nile, came near to the truth, since they really border upon Lake Ukereoue, the conjectured reservoir of the waters of the great river.</p> 
<p>From Kafuro, the main district of the merchants of that country, he descried, at length, on the horizon, the lake so much desired and so long sought for, of which Captain Speke caught a glimpse on the 3d of August, 1858.</p> 
<p>Samuel Ferguson felt real emotion: he was almost in contact with one of the principal points of his expedition, and, with his spy-glass constantly raised, he kept every nook and corner of the mysterious region in sight. His gaze wandered over details that might have been thus described:</p> 
<p>"Beneath him extended a country generally destitute of cultivation; only here and there some ravines seemed under tillage; the surface, dotted with peaks of medium height, grew flat as it approached the lake; barley-fields took the place of rice-plantations, and there, too, could be seen growing the species of plantain from which the wine of the country is drawn, and mwani, the wild plant which supplies a substitute for coffee. A collection of some fifty or more circular huts, covered with a flowering thatch, constituted the capital of the Karagwah country."</p> 
<p>He could easily distinguish the astonished countenances of a rather fine-looking race of natives of yellowish-brown complexion. Women of incredible corpulence were dawdling about through the cultivated grounds, and the doctor greatly surprised his companions by informing them that this rotundity, which is highly esteemed in that region, was obtained by an obligatory diet of curdled milk.</p> 
<p>At noon, the Victoria was in one degree forty-five minutes south latitude, and at one o'clock the wind was driving her directly toward the lake.</p> 
<p>This sheet of water was christened Uyanza Victoria, or Victoria Lake, by Captain Speke. At the place now mentioned it might measure about ninety miles in breadth, and at its southern extremity the captain found a group of islets, which he named the Archipelago of Bengal. He pushed his survey as far as Muanza, on the eastern coast, where he was received by the sultan. He made a triangulation of this part of the lake, but he could not procure a boat, either to cross it or to visit the great island of Ukereoue which is very populous, is governed by three sultans, and appears to be only a promontory at low tide.</p> 
<p>The balloon approached the lake more to the northward, to the doctor's great regret, for it had been his wish to determine its lower outlines. Its shores seemed to be thickly set with brambles and thorny plants, growing together in wild confusion, and were literally hidden, sometimes, from the gaze, by myriads of mosquitoes of a light-brown hue. The country was evidently habitable and inhabited. Troops of hippopotami could be seen disporting themselves in the forests of reeds, or plunging beneath the whitish waters of the lake.</p> 
<p>The latter, seen from above, presented, toward the west, so broad an horizon that it might have been called a sea; the distance between the two shores is so great that communication cannot be established, and storms are frequent and violent, for the winds sweep with fury over this elevated and unsheltered basin.</p> 
<p>The doctor experienced some difficulty in guiding his course; he was afraid of being carried toward the east, but, fortunately, a current bore him directly toward the north, and at six o'clock in the evening the balloon alighted on a small desert island in thirty minutes south latitude, and thirty-two degrees fifty-two minutes east longitude, about twenty miles from the shore.</p> 
<p>The travellers succeeded in making fast to a tree, and, the wind having fallen calm toward evening, they remained quietly at anchor. They dared not dream of taking the ground, since here, as on the shores of the Uyanza, legions of mosquitoes covered the soil in dense clouds. Joe even came back, from securing the anchor in the tree, speckled with bites, but he kept his temper, because he found it quite the natural thing for mosquitoes to treat him as they had done.</p> 
<p>Nevertheless, the doctor, who was less of an optimist, let out as much rope as he could, so as to escape these pitiless insects, that began to rise toward him with a threatening hum.</p> 
<p>The doctor ascertained the height of the lake above the level of the sea, as it had been determined by Captain Speke, say three thousand seven hundred and fifty feet.</p> 
<p>"Here we are, then, on an island!" said Joe, scratching as though he'd tear his nails out.</p> 
<p>"We could make the tour of it in a jiffy," added Kennedy, "and, excepting these confounded mosquitoes, there's not a living being to be seen on it."</p> 
<p>"The islands with which the lake is dotted," replied the doctor, "are nothing, after all, but the tops of submerged hills; but we are lucky to have found a retreat among them, for the shores of the lake are inhabited by ferocious tribes. Take your sleep, then, since Providence has granted us a tranquil night."</p> 
<p>"Won't you do the same, doctor?"</p> 
<p>"No, I could not close my eyes. My thoughts would banish sleep. To-morrow, my friends, should the wind prove favorable, we shall go due north, and we shall, perhaps, discover the sources of the Nile, that grand secret which has so long remained impenetrable. Near as we are to the sources of the renowned river, I could not sleep."</p> 
<p>Kennedy and Joe, whom scientific speculations failed to disturb to that extent, were not long in falling into sound slumber, while the doctor held his post.</p> 
<p>On Wednesday, April 23d, the balloon started at four o'clock in the morning, with a grayish sky overhead; night was slow in quitting the surface of the lake, which was enveloped in a dense fog, but presently a violent breeze scattered all the mists, and, after the balloon had been swung to and fro for a moment, in opposite directions, it at length veered in a straight line toward the north.</p> 
<p>Dr. Ferguson fairly clapped his hands for joy.</p> 
<p>"We are on the right track!" he exclaimed. "To-day or never we shall see the Nile! Look, my friends, we are crossing the equator! We are entering our own hemisphere!"</p> 
<p>"Ah!" said Joe, "do you think, doctor, that the equator passes here?"</p> 
<p>"Just here, my boy!"</p> 
<p>"Well, then, with all respect to you, sir, it seems to me that this is the very time to moisten it."</p> 
<p>"Good!" said the doctor, laughing. "Let us have a glass of punch. You have a way of comprehending cosmography that is any thing but dull."</p> 
<p>And thus was the passage of the Victoria over the equator duly celebrated.</p> 
<p>The balloon made rapid headway. In the west could be seen a low and but slightly-diversified coast, and, farther away in the background, the elevated plains of the Uganda and the Usoga. At length, the rapidity of the wind became excessive, approaching thirty miles per hour.</p> 
<p>The waters of the Nyanza, violently agitated, were foaming like the billows of a sea. By the appearance of certain long swells that followed the sinking of the waves, the doctor was enabled to conclude that the lake must have great depth of water. Only one or two rude boats were seen during this rapid passage.</p> 
<p>"This lake is evidently, from its elevated position, the natural reservoir of the rivers in the eastern part of Africa, and the sky gives back to it in rain what it takes in vapor from the streams that flow out of it. I am certain that the Nile must here take its rise."</p> 
<p>"Well, we shall see!" said Kennedy.</p> 
<p>About nine o'clock they drew nearer to the western coast. It seemed deserted, and covered with woods; the wind freshened a little toward the east, and the other shore of the lake could be seen. It bent around in such a curve as to end in a wide angle toward two degrees forty minutes north latitude. Lofty mountains uplifted their arid peaks at this extremity of Nyanza; but, between them, a deep and winding gorge gave exit to a turbulent and foaming river.</p> 
<p>While busy managing the balloon, Dr. Ferguson never ceased reconnoitring the country with eager eyes.</p> 
<p>"Look!" he exclaimed, "look, my friends! the statements of the Arabs were correct! They spoke of a river by which Lake Ukereoue discharged its waters toward the north, and this river exists, and we are descending it, and it flows with a speed analogous to our own! And this drop of water now gliding away beneath our feet is, beyond all question, rushing on, to mingle with the Mediterranean! It is the Nile!"</p> 
<p>"It is the Nile!" reeechoed Kennedy, carried away by the enthusiasm of his friend.</p> 
<p>"Hurrah for the Nile!" shouted Joe, glad, and always ready to cheer for something.</p> 
<p>Enormous rocks, here and there, embarrassed the course of this mysterious river. The water foamed as it fell in rapids and cataracts, which confirmed the doctor in his preconceived ideas on the subject. From the environing mountains numerous torrents came plunging and seething down, and the eye could take them in by hundreds. There could be seen, starting from the soil, delicate jets of water scattering in all directions, crossing and recrossing each other, mingling, contending in the swiftness of their progress, and all rushing toward that nascent stream which became a river after having drunk them in.</p> 
<p>"Here is, indeed, the Nile!" reiterated the doctor, with the tone of profound conviction. "The origin of its name, like the origin of its waters, has fired the imagination of the learned; they have sought to trace it from the Greek, the Coptic, the Sanscrit; but all that matters little now, since we have made it surrender the secret of its source!"</p> 
<p>"But," said the Scotchman, "how are you to make sure of the identity of this river with the one recognized by the travellers from the north?"</p> 
<p>"We shall have certain, irrefutable, convincing, and infallible proof," replied Ferguson, "should the wind hold another hour in our favor!"</p> 
<p>The mountains drew farther apart, revealing in their place numerous villages, and fields of white Indian corn, doura, and sugar-cane. The tribes inhabiting the region seemed excited and hostile; they manifested more anger than adoration, and evidently saw in the aeronauts only obtrusive strangers, and not condescending deities. It appeared as though, in approaching the sources of the Nile, these men came to rob them of something, and so the Victoria had to keep out of range of their muskets.</p> 
<p>"To land here would be a ticklish matter!" said the Scot.</p> 
<p>"Well!" said Joe, "so much the worse for these natives. They'll have to do without the pleasure of our conversation."</p> 
<p>"Nevertheless, descend I must," said the doctor, "were it only for a quarter of an hour. Without doing so I cannot verify the results of our expedition."</p> 
<p>"It is indispensable, then, doctor?"</p> 
<p>"Indispensable; and we will descend, even if we have to do so with a volley of musketry."</p> 
<p>"The thing suits me," said Kennedy, toying with his pet rifle.</p> 
<p>"And I'm ready, master, whenever you say the word!" added Joe, preparing for the fight.</p> 
<p>"It would not be the first time," remarked the doctor, "that science has been followed up, sword in hand. The same thing happened to a French savant among the mountains of Spain, when he was measuring the terrestrial meridian."</p> 
<p>"Be easy on that score, doctor, and trust to your two body-guards."</p> 
<p>"Are we there, master?"</p> 
<p>"Not yet. In fact, I shall go up a little, first, in order to get an exact idea of the configuration of the country."</p> 
<p>The hydrogen expanded, and in less than ten minutes the balloon was soaring at a height of twenty-five hundred feet above the ground.</p> 
<p>From that elevation could be distinguished an inextricable network of smaller streams which the river received into its bosom; others came from the west, from between numerous hills, in the midst of fertile plains.</p> 
<p>"We are not ninety miles from Gondokoro," said the doctor, measuring off the distance on his map, "and less than five miles from the point reached by the explorers from the north. Let us descend with great care."</p> 
<p>And, upon this, the balloon was lowered about two thousand feet.</p> 
<p>"Now, my friends, let us be ready, come what may."</p> 
<p>"Ready it is!" said Dick and Joe, with one voice.</p> 
<p>"Good!"</p> 
<p>In a few moments the balloon was advancing along the bed of the river, and scarcely one hundred feet above the ground. The Nile measured but fifty fathoms in width at this point, and the natives were in great excitement, rushing to and fro, tumultuously, in the villages that lined the banks of the stream. At the second degree it forms a perpendicular cascade of ten feet in height, and consequently impassable by boats.</p> 
<p>"Here, then, is the cascade mentioned by Debono!" exclaimed the doctor.</p> 
<p>The basin of the river spread out, dotted with numerous islands, which Dr. Ferguson devoured with his eyes. He seemed to be seeking for a point of reference which he had not yet found.</p> 
<p>By this time, some blacks, having ventured in a boat just under the balloon, Kennedy saluted them with a shot from his rifle, that made them regain the bank at their utmost speed.</p> 
<p>"A good journey to you," bawled Joe, "and if I were in your place, I wouldn't try coming back again. I should be mightily afraid of a monster that can hurl thunderbolts when he pleases."</p> 
<p>But, all at once, the doctor snatched up his spy-glass, and directed it toward an island reposing in the middle of the river.</p> 
<p>"Four trees!" he exclaimed; "look, down there!" Sure enough, there were four trees standing alone at one end of it.</p> 
<p>"It is Bengal Island! It is the very same," repeated the doctor, exultingly.</p> 
<p>"And what of that?" asked Dick.</p> 
<p>"It is there that we shall alight, if God permits."</p> 
<p>"But, it seems to be inhabited, doctor."</p> 
<p>"Joe is right; and, unless I'm mistaken, there is a group of about a score of natives on it now."</p> 
<p>"We'll make them scatter; there'll be no great trouble in that," responded Ferguson.</p> 
<p>"So be it," chimed in the hunter.</p> 
<p>The sun was at the zenith as the balloon approached the island.</p> 
<p>The blacks, who were members of the Makado tribe, were howling lustily, and one of them waved his bark hat in the air. Kennedy took aim at him, fired, and his hat flew about him in pieces. Thereupon there was a general scamper. The natives plunged headlong into the river, and swam to the opposite bank. Immediately, there came a shower of balls from both banks, along with a perfect cloud of arrows, but without doing the balloon any damage, where it rested with its anchor snugly secured in the fissure of a rock. Joe lost no time in sliding to the ground.</p> 
<p>"The ladder!" cried the doctor. "Follow me, Kennedy."</p> 
<p>"What do you wish, sir?"</p> 
<p>"Let us alight. I want a witness."</p> 
<p>"Here I am!"</p> 
<p>"Mind your post, Joe, and keep a good lookout."</p> 
<p>"Never fear, doctor; I'll answer for all that."</p> 
<p>"Come, Dick," said the doctor, as he touched the ground.</p> 
<p>So saying, he drew his companion along toward a group of rocks that rose upon one point of the island; there, after searching for some time, he began to rummage among the brambles, and, in so doing, scratched his hands until they bled.</p> 
<p>Suddenly he grasped Kennedy's arm, exclaiming: "Look! look!"</p> 
<p>"Letters!"</p> 
<p>Yes; there, indeed, could be descried, with perfect precision of outline, some letters carved on the rock. It was quite easy to make them out:</p> 
<p>"A. D."</p> 
<p>"A.D.!" repeated Dr. Ferguson. "Andrea Debono-- the very signature of the traveller who farthest ascended the current of the Nile."</p> 
<p>"No doubt of that, friend Samuel," assented Kennedy.</p> 
<p>"Are you now convinced?"</p> 
<p>"It is the Nile! We cannot entertain a doubt on that score now," was the reply.</p> 
<p>The doctor, for the last time, examined those precious initials, the exact form and size of which he carefully noted.</p> 
<p>"And now," said he--"now for the balloon!"</p> 
<p>"Quickly, then, for I see some of the natives getting ready to recross the river."</p> 
<p>"That matters little to us now. Let the wind but send us northward for a few hours, and we shall reach Gondokoro, and press the hands of some of our countrymen."</p> 
<p>Ten minutes more, and the balloon was majestically ascending, while Dr. Ferguson, in token of success, waved the English flag triumphantly from his car.</p> 
<p>卡拉瓜——乌克雷维湖——岛上的一夜——赤道——飞越乌克雷维湖——瀑布——看地形——尼罗河源头——本加岛——安德里·德博诺的签字——英国战旗</p> 
<p>第二天早上，3人从5点钟起开始做重新上路的准备工作。乔用斧子砍断象牙取下锚。头一天，他很幸运地找到了博士失落的这把斧子。重获自由的“维多利亚号”载着这三位旅行家以每小时18英里的速度向东北飞去。</p> 
<p>第二天晚上，博士根据星星的高度精心测定出他们所在的方位是赤道下面南纬2度40分，也就是说，距离赤道160地理里。气球飞过许多村庄，丝毫不理会下面村民因它出现而发出的叫喊声。飞行中每到一个地方，博士都把地形概貌画下来。气球从鲁邦埃山的山坡上横飞过去：这些山坡差不多同乌萨加拉山顶峰一样陡峭。后来在坦加山，他们遇到了卡拉瓜山最初的几条支脉。根据博士的判断，卡拉瓜山脉必定是月亮山的分支。古老传说中把这些山当作尼罗河的摇篮，看来，这与事实很接近。因为，这些山毗邻乌克雷维湖，而乌克雷维湖被认定为是尼罗河的发源地。</p> 
<p>气球抵达卡夫罗，这个当地最大的商业中心的上空。这时，博士终于望见了远方地平线上的乌克雷维湖。1858年8月3日，斯皮克上尉隐约看见的这个湖，多少年来让人们花费了大量气力和时间来找它。现在，它终于展现在三位旅行家的眼前了。</p> 
<p>弗格森·弗格森觉得非常激动。这儿是他这趟旅行的主要考察点之一，现在他差不多已经触摸到了。他举起望远镜仔仔细细察看这个神秘地区的每一个角落，生怕漏掉什么。他的眼中依次显现出如下场景：</p> 
<p>总的看来，土地较为贫瘠，几乎没有几块洼地被耕种过；地面布满了高度差不多的小丘，但越靠近湖地面越平展；大麦田取代了水稻田；这里生长着当地酿酒用的车前草和“姆瓦尼”——当地充当咖啡的一种野生植物；一个约有50所圆顶茅屋的集镇。茅屋顶覆盖着一种带花的茎杆。该集镇就是卡拉瓜的首邑。</p> 
<p>3位旅行家很快发现这里的人都长得相当漂亮。 看到气球飞来，他们那棕黄色的脸上露出了非常惊讶的表情。一些奇胖无比的女人在田间地头上困难地行走着。博士告诉伙伴们，这种胖是每天坚持吃凝乳的缘故，因为，这个地方的人非常喜欢胖女人，他们认为女人越胖越美。听了博士的介绍，猎人和乔十分惊奇。</p> 
<p>中午时分，“维多利亚号”来到南纬1度45分的地方。1点钟时，风把他们吹向湖的上空。</p> 
<p>这个湖曾被斯皮克上尉命名为维多利亚尼昂扎①。气球所处的这块湖面，估计有90英里宽。斯皮克上尉曾在湖的南端发现一群小岛。他称它们为孟加拉群岛。他当时一直深入到湖东岸的穆昂扎。在那儿，他受到了当地苏丹的热情款待。上尉对这部分湖进行了三角测量。但是，他既无法搞到小船过湖，也无法去最大的乌克雷维岛上看看。 这个岛人口非常稠密，整个岛由3位苏丹统治着。退潮的时候，它就成了一个半岛。</p> 
<p>①“尼昂扎”是当地语“湖”的意思。</p> 
<p>“维多利亚号”更靠近湖的北部，这令博士深感遗憾，他原想测定一下湖南部的轮廓。灌木丛生，荆棘满地的湖岸简直被密密麻麻的浅褐色蚊子遮盖得严严实实。这个地方无法住人，故尔没人居住。成群成群的河马懒洋洋地躺在芦苇荡中，或躲在白花花的湖水里。</p> 
<p>从高处望去，乌克雷维湖的西部湖区水面宽广，犹如大海。湖两岸之间的距离相当远，看来难以建立联系。另外，这里的风暴既凶猛又频繁，因为在这片高旷的盆地里，风可以恣意逞凶。</p> 
<p>现在，气球变得难以操纵了。博士一直怕气球会被吹往东面。好在这时来了一股气流带着气球径直往北飞去。 晚上6点钟，“维多利亚号”停在了距岸边20英里的一个荒岛上，方位是南纬0度30分，东经32度52分。</p> 
<p>旅行家们用锚钩住了一棵树。这时天色将晚，风早已平息，他们安心地乘着气球，停留在树的上空。至于下到地面去，根本不可能办到，甚至联想都不要想。这个地方同湖沿岸一样，成群结队的蚊子乌云般密密遮住了地面。乔到树上去了一趟，回来时身上就被叮满了疙瘩。不过，乔对此并不恼火，他认为从蚊子这方面来说，叮人是很正常的。</p> 
<p>但是，博士可不如乔那么乐观。他把锚索尽可能地放得长些，好躲开发着令人讨厌的叫声正往上飞的这些无情昆虫。</p> 
<p>博士测了测湖的海拔高度。和斯皮克上尉当年测定的一样，该湖的海拔高度为3750尺。</p> 
<p>“这么说，我们是在一个岛上啦！”乔惊讶地说。他抓痒抓得手都酸了。</p> 
<p>“我们能绕湖转一圈看看就好了。”猎人遗憾地说，“瞧瞧这儿，除了这些可爱的小昆虫，看不见一个活着的。”</p> 
<p>“湖里到处都是岛。”弗格森博士答道，“真的说起来，这些岛其实都是淹在水中的那些小山露出的山顶。不过，我们很幸运，在这儿遇到了一个歇脚处，因为湖沿岸住着的尽是些残暴的部落。既然老天爷给我们安排了一个恬静的夜晚，你们就睡吧。”</p> 
<p>“弗格森，你不睡一会儿吗？”</p> 
<p>“不睡了，我合不上眼，要想的事太多，睡意都没了。诸位朋友，明天如果顺风，我们就笔直往北飞。那时，我们也许能发现尼罗河源头。那个神秘的地方还不曾有人到过呢。离大河源头这么近，我是不可能睡着的。”</p> 
<p>至于肯尼迪和乔，对科学的关注丝毫不影响睡眠。他们在博士的看守下，很快沉入了梦乡。</p> 
<p>4月23日星期三，凌晨4点钟，天空呈浅灰色。“维多利亚号”起航了。此时夜幕正艰难地步出浓雾笼罩着的湖面，可是很快，一阵急风就把雾吹散了。“维多利亚号”在空中摆动了几分钟，最后径直向北飞去。</p> 
<p>弗格森博士高兴地拍了拍手。</p> 
<p>“我们的路没错！”他喊道，“今天、明天或以后的某一天，我们将看到尼罗河了！朋友们，现在我们在穿越赤道！我们正在进入我们的北半球！”</p> 
<p>“哦！”乔惊讶地问道，“主人，您认为赤道从这里穿过吗？”</p> 
<p>“就是从这里，我可爱的孩子！”</p> 
<p>“好极了！主人，请您别见怪，我觉得抓紧时间喝点酒庆祝庆祝才合适呢。”</p> 
<p>“这主意不错！去拿杯酒来！”博士笑着回答，“乔，你理解宇宙学的方式倒也一点不傻。”</p> 
<p>他们就这样在“维多利亚号”上举行了跨越赤道线的仪式。</p> 
<p>气球快速地飞着，西边显现出较为平缓的低坡。其实，那就是乌干达和乌索加地势较为隆起的高原。风速越来越大了，几乎达到每小时30英里。</p> 
<p>湖波汹涌，大浪滚滚，犹如海涛咆哮，在湖面上溅起朵朵白色浪花。波涛喘息间，深水处涌起的一些大浪仍久久不肯落下。博士根据观察，断定湖水很深。气球从湖上快速飞过时，他们只隐约看见一二条做工粗糙的独木舟飘荡在水面上。</p> 
<p>“这个湖由于地势高，显然是非洲东部各大河流的天然源头。”博士说，“老天爷把这个湖支流的水化为水蒸汽带走，又把水蒸汽化为雨水还给了湖。我觉得，尼罗河的源头应该是它，这大概不会错了。”</p> 
<p>“等着瞧吧。”肯尼迪回了一句。</p> 
<p>将近9点， 气球飞近了西岸，那里看上去林木葱宠，荒无人烟。就在这时，风向微微转向了东方， 不久，湖的东岸就隐约可见了。这条湖岸弯度很大，在北纬2度40分的地方形成了一个大大的拐角。湖的彼岸耸立着许多陡峭的山峰。山峰间，一条蜿蜒幽深的峡谷中流淌着一条奔腾的河流。</p> 
<p>弗格森博士一边操纵着气球，一边目光贪婪地审视着这个地区。</p> 
<p>“你们看哪！”他叫道，“朋友们，你们看哪！阿拉伯人的传说没有错！他们谈到过这条河，乌克雷维湖水就是打这条河流向北方的。的确有这么一条河。现在，我们正沿着这条河往下去。而且，河的水流速度正好和我们的移动速度一样快！我们脚下淌的这股水流肯定会掺和到地中海的波涛中去！这就是尼罗河！”</p> 
<p>“是尼罗河！”肯尼迪重复道。弗格森·弗格森的激情也感染了他。</p> 
<p>“尼罗河万岁！”乔高呼。他高兴时总要不由自主地喊点什么万岁。</p> 
<p>时不时地可以看见一些巨大的礁石阻碍着这条神秘河的水流奔泻。水泛起白浪，加快了速度，形成了一个个瀑布。博士的预见在这儿得到了验证。只见成百上千条激流，一路上溅起千万堆白雪，从周围的高山上倾泻而下，最后汇入瀑布。冒出地面的无数条细流，相互交错、融合，争先恐后地向下流淌，最后全都奔入这条新生河。它正是汇集了干百条细流，最后才成为一条有名的大河。</p> 
<p>“这正是尼罗河。”博士满怀信心地肯定道，“这条河名字的来由，如同它的发源地一样曾激起许多学者的兴趣。有人说河名来自希腊文，有的说来自科普特文①，还有的认为来自梵文②。不过，现在这些都无关紧要了，因为它毕竟已经把它源头的秘密告诉了我们，尽管有点不是那么情愿。”</p> 
<p>①希腊科普特族的文字。</p> 
<p>②一位拜占庭学者发现“Neilos”是由一组数字组成的名词。N代表50，E为5，I为10，L为0，O为70，S为200。这些数字的和正好是一年的天数。</p> 
<p>“可是，”猎人说，“怎么才能证明这条河就是北面来的旅行家们察看过的那条河呢？”</p> 
<p>“只要再有一个小时的顺风，我们就会有一些确凿无疑、谁也驳不倒的证据了。”博士充满自信地回答。</p> 
<p>群山分开了，仿佛是故意把大片的土地让给众多的村庄、芝麻田、甜高粱地和甘蔗园。看到气球飞来，该地区所有部落的人都显得很不安，表现出了明显的敌对情绪。 他们猜到这3位旅行家是外国人而不是神，所以他们似乎非常气愤，而不是崇拜，就好像旅行家们不是来追溯尼罗河源头的，而是偷他们什么东西的，因此，“维多利亚号”不得不保持在火枪射程之外的空中飞行。</p> 
<p>“看来，在这儿着陆很困难。”苏格兰人说。</p> 
<p>“哼！这些倒霉的土著人，”乔回答道，“连和咱们谈话的乐趣都享受不到。咱们就是不给他们。”</p> 
<p>“不过，我还是需要降下去的呀，”弗格森博士答道，“哪怕只有一刻钟也行。否则，我就无法察看我们探险的成果了。”</p> 
<p>“真的非降下去不可吗，弗格森？”</p> 
<p>“是的，即使不得不动枪，也得降下去！”</p> 
<p>“这事我喜欢。”肯尼迪抚摸着他的马枪，答道。</p> 
<p>“您想降下去就降下去吧，主人。”乔一边说，一边作战斗准备。</p> 
<p>“一手拿枪，一手搞科学，以后这种事还多着呢。”博士说，“有位法国学者也遇到过这种事。当时他正在西班牙的山区里测量地球子午线。”</p> 
<p>“放心吧，弗格森，你就信赖你的两位保镖好了。”</p> 
<p>“先生，我们开始下降吗？”</p> 
<p>“还不到时候呢。我们甚至要往上升一些，好弄清楚这地方的确切地貌。”</p> 
<p>氢气膨胀了。还不到10分钟，“维多利亚号”已经在距地面2500尺高的高空中翱翔了。</p> 
<p>从这里， 3位旅行家弄清了这些密密麻麻、纵横交错的小河如何最后汇入了大河中。这些小河大部分是从西方众多山冈之间，从肥沃的原野里流出来的。</p> 
<p>“我们的位置距刚多科罗不到90英里。”博士边在地图上作标记，边说，“距从北方来的探险家们的目的地不到5英里。行了，我们现在开始小心降落。”</p> 
<p>“维多利亚号”立即下降了2000尺。</p> 
<p>“朋友们，现在准备好碰碰运气吧。”</p> 
<p>“准备好了。”肯尼迪和乔异口同声地答道。</p> 
<p>“太好了！”</p> 
<p>很快， “维多利亚号”沿着大河的河床，以几乎不到100尺的高度向前飘去。在这一地段，尼罗河的高度是50托瓦兹。这时，两岸村子里的土著人乱哄哄地焦躁起来。在北纬2度的地方，河水形成一个落差约10尺的瀑布，所以，这儿无法过河。</p> 
<p>“这正是德博诺先生指出的瀑布。”博士说道。</p> 
<p>到了下游，大河变宽了，河里布满了小岛。弗格森·弗格森睁大眼睛，贪婪地盯着这些小岛，久久不舍得移开。他似乎在四处寻找一个基准点，不过还没找到罢了。</p> 
<p>几位黑人驾着独木舟在气球下面追赶。肯尼迪见状，朝他们放了一枪，算是给个警告。虽然子弹没有伤到他们，但还是逼得他们尽快地返回了岸边。</p> 
<p>“一路平安！”乔戏谑地向他们喊道，“如果我是他们，我可不会拿着性命开玩笑再回来，我会被这个乱喷雷电的怪物吓坏的。”</p> 
<p>就在这时，弗格森博士突然抓起望远镜，对准卧在大河中心的一个小岛。</p> 
<p>“4棵树！”他大喊一声。“快来看，那边！”</p> 
<p>果然，岛的顶端孤零零地立着4棵大树。</p> 
<p>“是本加岛！没错，正是它！”他又补充道。</p> 
<p>“噢！那么，我们还干点什么？”狄克·肯尼迪问。</p> 
<p>“我们下到那儿去。但愿能成！”博士坚定地回答。</p> 
<p>“可是，好像岛上有人住呀，弗格森先生！”乔提醒道。</p> 
<p>“乔说的对。如果我没弄错的话，那儿聚着20来个土著人呢。”肯尼迪证实道。</p> 
<p>“赶走他们不就行了，这没什么难的。”弗格森博士回答。</p> 
<p>“那好，说干就干吧！”猎人说。</p> 
<p>现在正是太阳当头的时候，“维多利亚号”渐渐靠近了小岛。</p> 
<p>岛上的居民属玛克多部落。看到气球逼近小岛，他们拼命大喊大叫，其中一位黑人还向空中挥动着他那用树皮做的帽子。肯尼迪瞄准那顶帽子开了一枪，帽子顿时变成了碎片。</p> 
<p>这一下，黑人全都慌了神，他们拔腿向大河跑去，很快游到对岸去了。不久，从河的两岸射来雹子般的子弹和雨点般的利箭。然而，这丝毫伤不到气球，它的锚早已勾住一块岩石的缝隙。乔顺着锚索溜到地面。</p> 
<p>“放绳梯！”博士高喊，“肯尼迪，跟我来！”</p> 
<p>“你要干什么？”</p> 
<p>“我们下去，因为我需要你当证人。”</p> 
<p>“好吧，我来了。”</p> 
<p>“乔，你要严加警戒。”</p> 
<p>“放心吧，先生。一切交给我好了。”</p> 
<p>“肯尼迪，来吧。”博士说着，双脚已踏上了地面。</p> 
<p>他带领同伴朝岛顶端高峻突兀的岩石走去。到了那里，他东张西望了一会儿，接着在荆棘中搜来搜去，好像在寻找什么东西，甚至两只手都被刺得鲜血直流。突然，他一把抓住猎人的手，说：</p> 
<p>“你瞧！”</p> 
<p>“有字！”肯尼迪不由得叫了一声。</p> 
<p>的确，岩石上清楚无误地刻着两个字母：A·D·</p> 
<p>“A·D·！”弗格森博士口中重复道，“安德里·德博诺！这就是那位旅行家的亲笔签名！他沿着尼罗河往上走得最远。”</p> 
<p>“这当然不容置疑啦，弗格森老友。”</p> 
<p>“现在，你相信了？”</p> 
<p>“是尼罗河！这一点，我们不能怀疑。”</p> 
<p>博士立即着手把这两个珍贵的字母按原来的大小和形状分毫不差地记了下来。事毕，他向这两个字母望了最后一眼，说：</p> 
<p>“好了，现在我们回到气球上去吧！”</p> 
<p>“那么咱们得快点。你瞧，有几个土著人正准备过河呢。”</p> 
<p>“现在，我们不在乎了！让风把我们往北送上几个小时吧。这样，我们就能抵达刚多科罗，甚至能和我们的同胞握上手了。”</p> 
<p>10分钟后，气球威风十足地向空中升去。与此同时，博士展开了一面英国国旗以庆祝这次岛上的考察成功。</p>
