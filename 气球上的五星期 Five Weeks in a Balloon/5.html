<p>Dr. Ferguson energetically pushed the preparations for his departure, and in person superintended the construction of his balloon, with certain modifications; in regard to which he observed the most absolute silence. For a long time past he had been applying himself to the study of the Arab language and the various Mandingoe idioms, and, thanks to his talents as a polyglot, he had made rapid progress.</p> 
<p>In the mean while his friend, the sportsman, never let him out of his sight--afraid, no doubt, that the doctor might take his departure, without saying a word to anybody. On this subject, he regaled him with the most persuasive arguments, which, however, did NOT persuade Samuel Ferguson, and wasted his breath in pathetic entreaties, by which the latter seemed to be but slightly moved. In fine, Dick felt that the doctor was slipping through his fingers.</p> 
<p>The poor Scot was really to be pitied. He could not look upon the azure vault without a sombre terror: when asleep, he felt oscillations that made his head reel; and every night he had visions of being swung aloft at immeasurable heights.</p> 
<p>We must add that, during these fearful nightmares, he once or twice fell out of bed. His first care then was to show Ferguson a severe contusion that he had received on the cranium. "And yet," he would add, with warmth, "that was at the height of only three feet--not an inch more--and such a bump as this! Only think, then!"</p> 
<p>This insinuation, full of sad meaning as it was, did not seem to touch the doctor's heart.</p> 
<p>"We'll not fall," was his invariable reply.</p> 
<p>"But, still, suppose that we WERE to fall!"</p> 
<p>"We will NOT fall!"</p> 
<p>This was decisive, and Kennedy had nothing more to say.</p> 
<p>What particularly exasperated Dick was, that the doctor seemed completely to lose sight of his personality-- of his--Kennedy's--and to look upon him as irrevocably destined to become his aerial companion. Not even the shadow of a doubt was ever suggested; and Samuel made an intolerable misuse of the first person plural:</p> 
<p>"'We' are getting along; 'we' shall be ready on the ----; 'we' shall start on the ----," etc., etc.</p> 
<p>And then there was the singular possessive adjective:</p> 
<p>"'Our' balloon; 'our' car; 'our' expedition."</p> 
<p>And the same in the plural, too:</p> 
<p>"'Our' preparations; 'our' discoveries; 'our' ascensions."</p> 
<p>Dick shuddered at them, although he was determined not to go; but he did not want to annoy his friend. Let us also disclose the fact that, without knowing exactly why himself, he had sent to Edinburgh for a certain selection of heavy clothing, and his best hunting-gear and fire-arms.</p> 
<p>One day, after having admitted that, with an overwhelming run of good-luck, there MIGHT be one chance of success in a thousand, he pretended to yield entirely to the doctor's wishes; but, in order to still put off the journey, he opened the most varied series of subterfuges. He threw himself back upon questioning the utility of the expedition--its opportuneness, etc. This discovery of the sources of the Nile, was it likely to be of any use?--Would one have really labored for the welfare of humanity?-- When, after all, the African tribes should have been civilized, would they be any happier?--Were folks certain that civilization had not its chosen abode there rather than in Europe?--Perhaps!--And then, couldn't one wait a little longer?--The trip across Africa would certainly be accomplished some day, and in a less hazardous manner.-- In another month, or in six months before the year was over, some explorer would undoubtedly come in--etc., etc.</p> 
<p>These hints produced an effect exactly opposite to what was desired or intended, and the doctor trembled with impatience.</p> 
<p>"Are you willing, then, wretched Dick--are you willing, false friend--that this glory should belong to another? Must I then be untrue to my past history; recoil before obstacles that are not serious; requite with cowardly hesitation what both the English Government and the Royal Society of London have done for me?"</p> 
<p>"But," resumed Kennedy, who made great use of that conjunction.</p> 
<p>"But," said the doctor, "are you not aware that my journey is to compete with the success of the expeditions now on foot? Don't you know that fresh explorers are advancing toward the centre of Africa?"</p> 
<p>"Still--"</p> 
<p>"Listen to me, Dick," and cast your eyes over that map."</p> 
<p>Dick glanced over it, with resignation.</p> 
<p>"Now, ascend the course of the Nile."</p> 
<p>"I have ascended it," replied the Scotchman, with docility.</p> 
<p>"Stop at Gondokoro."</p> 
<p>"I am there."</p> 
<p>And Kennedy thought to himself how easy such a trip was--on the map!</p> 
<p>"Now, take one of the points of these dividers and let it rest upon that place beyond which the most daring explorers have scarcely gone."</p> 
<p>"I have done so."</p> 
<p>"And now look along the coast for the island of Zanzibar, in latitude six degrees south."</p> 
<p>"I have it."</p> 
<p>"Now, follow the same parallel and arrive at Kazeh."</p> 
<p>"I have done so."</p> 
<p>"Run up again along the thirty-third degree of longitude to the opening of Lake Oukereoue, at the point where Lieutenant Speke had to halt."</p> 
<p>"I am there; a little more, and I should have tumbled into the lake."</p> 
<p>"Very good! Now, do you know what we have the right to suppose, according to the information given by the tribes that live along its shores?"</p> 
<p>"I haven't the least idea."</p> 
<p>"Why, that this lake, the lower extremity of which is in two degrees and thirty minutes, must extend also two degrees and a half above the equator."</p> 
<p>"Really!"</p> 
<p>"Well from this northern extremity there flows a stream which must necessarily join the Nile, if it be not the Nile itself."</p> 
<p>"That is, indeed, curious."</p> 
<p>"Then, let the other point of your dividers rest upon that extremity of Lake Oukereoue."</p> 
<p>"It is done, friend Ferguson."</p> 
<p>"Now, how many degrees can you count between the two points?"</p> 
<p>"Scarcely two."</p> 
<p>"And do you know what that means, Dick?"</p> 
<p>"Not the least in the world."</p> 
<p>"Why, that makes scarcely one hundred and twenty miles--in other words, a nothing."</p> 
<p>"Almost nothing, Samuel."</p> 
<p>"Well, do you know what is taking place at this moment?"</p> 
<p>"No, upon my honor, I do not."</p> 
<p>"Very well, then, I'll tell you. The Geographical Society regard as very important the exploration of this lake of which Speke caught a glimpse. Under their auspices, Lieutenant (now Captain) Speke has associated with him Captain Grant, of the army in India; they have put themselves at the head of a numerous and well-equipped expedition; their mission is to ascend the lake and return to Gondokoro; they have received a subsidy of more than five thousand pounds, and the Governor of the Cape of Good Hope has placed Hottentot soldiers at their disposal; they set out from Zanzibar at the close of October, 1860. In the mean while John Petherick, the English consul at the city of Karthoum, has received about seven hundred pounds from the foreign office; he is to equip a steamer at Karthoum, stock it with sufficient provisions, and make his way to Gondokoro; there, he will await Captain Speke's caravan, and be able to replenish its supplies to some extent."</p> 
<p>"Well planned," said Kennedy.</p> 
<p>"You can easily see, then, that time presses if we are to take part in these exploring labors. And that is not all, since, while some are thus advancing with sure steps to the discovery of the sources of the Nile, others are penetrating to the very heart of Africa."</p> 
<p>"On foot?" said Kennedy.</p> 
<p>"Yes, on foot," rejoined the doctor, without noticing the insinuation. "Doctor Krapf proposes to push forward, in the west, by way of the Djob, a river lying under the equator. Baron de Decken has already set out from Monbaz, has reconnoitred the mountains of Kenaia and Kilimandjaro, and is now plunging in toward the centre."</p> 
<p>"But all this time on foot?"</p> 
<p>"On foot or on mules."</p> 
<p>"Exactly the same, so far as I am concerned," ejaculated Kennedy.</p> 
<p>"Lastly," resumed the doctor, "M. de Heuglin, the Austrian vice-consul at Karthoum, has just organized a very important expedition, the first aim of which is to search for the traveller Vogel, who, in 1853, was sent into the Soudan to associate himself with the labors of Dr. Barth. In 1856, he quitted Bornou, and determined to explore the unknown country that lies between Lake Tchad and Darfur. Nothing has been seen of him since that time. Letters that were received in Alexandria, in 1860, said that he was killed at the order of the King of Wadai; but other letters, addressed by Dr. Hartmann to the traveller's father, relate that, according to the recital of a felatah of Bornou, Vogel was merely held as a prisoner at Wara. All hope is not then lost. Hence, a committee has been organized under the presidency of the Regent of Saxe-Cogurg-Gotha; my friend Petermann is its secretary; a national subscription has provided for the expense of the expedition, whose strength has been increased by the voluntary accession of several learned men, and M. de Heuglin set out from Massowah, in the month of June. While engaged in looking for Vogel, he is also to explore all the country between the Nile and Lake Tchad, that is to say, to knit together the operations of Captain Speke and those of Dr. Barth, and then Africa will have been traversed from east to west."*</p> 
<p>* After the departure of Dr. Ferguson, it was ascertained that M. de Heuglin, owing to some disagreement, took a route different from the one assigned to his expedition, the command of the latter having been transferred to Mr. Muntzinger.</p> 
<p>"Well," said the canny Scot, "since every thing is getting on so well, what's the use of our going down there?"</p> 
<p>Dr. Ferguson made no reply, but contented himself with a significant shrug of the shoulders.</p> 
<p>肯尼迪的梦——不恰当的复数称呼——肯尼迪的暗示——神游非洲——圆规两点间的距离——目前活动着的探险队——斯皮克和格兰特——克拉普夫、德肯、霍伊格林</p> 
<p>弗格森博士忙于出发前的准备工作。他亲自指导制作气球，并且对设计作了某些改动，不过他只字不提此事。很长时间以来，他专心学习阿拉伯语和非洲西部地区曼丁哥人的各种语言。因为他具有极高的语言天赋，所以学习进展很快。</p> 
<p>在此期间，他的猎人朋友寸步不离地跟着他，生怕他连招呼都不打就飞走。肯尼迪还在执意劝说弗格森博士放弃该计划。然而，无论话语多么娓娓动听也说服不了他。面对肯尼迪的苦苦哀求，他从不动心。每当这时，他总是设法躲开。肯尼迪渐渐感觉到他正在从自己的手指中溜掉。</p> 
<p>这位可怜的苏格兰人的确值得同情。现在他只要一想到天空就心惊肉跳，无比悲哀。睡梦中他觉得摇摇晃晃，头晕目眩，甚至夜夜梦见自己从高无边际的太空中栽了下来。应该补充一句，做恶梦期间，他曾经从床上掉下来过一二次。当时，他首先想到的，就是让弗格森看看他头上的伤疤。</p> 
<p>“要知道，才三尺高！”他侥幸地补充道，“低着呢！就这样，还撞了这么大个包！你好好想想吧！”</p> 
<p>这番暗示充满了伤感，但是并没打动博士。</p> 
<p>“我们不会掉下来的。”弗格森博士说。</p> 
<p>“不过，假如真的掉下来呢？”</p> 
<p>“我们掉不下来。”</p> 
<p>言语毫不含糊。肯尼迪无话可答了。</p> 
<p>特别令肯尼迪恼火的，就是弗格森博士似乎一点也不在乎他朋友的个性，只认准肯尼迪必定要成为他的空中旅伴。他认为这是铁板钉钉的事，没什么可说的。言语间，弗格森令人无法忍受地一再滥用代词的第一人称复数“我们”：</p> 
<p>“‘我们’前进……。”“‘我们’将在××月××号准备好。”“‘我们’将在××号动身。”……。</p> 
<p>要么就是“我们的”：</p> 
<p>“‘我们的’气球……。”“‘我们的’吊篮……。”“‘我们的’探险……。”“‘我们的’准备工作……。”“‘我们的’发现……。”“‘我们的’升高……”</p> 
<p>肯尼迪每次听到这话都不寒而栗，尽管他下决心根本不去。但是，他不愿过分惹朋友生气。说真的，他甚至已经悄悄地让人从爱丁堡家中送来了几件旅行用的衣服和几条他最好的猎枪，虽然他自己也没完全意识到为什么这么做。</p> 
<p>一天，肯尼迪假装向弗格森让步，承认只要交好运，总有千分之一的成功机会。但是为了推迟旅行，他开始找各种各样的借口。他左思右想，就探险的用处和时机提出了疑问：</p> 
<p>“这次对尼罗河源头的探索真得那么有必要吗？……真是为人类的幸福？……归根结底，就算非洲部落变文明了，那儿的人民会更幸福吗？……再者，谁能确信，那儿文明化的程度不比欧洲高？”——也许吧——“那么，就不能再等等？……总有一天，会有那么一位探险家能跨越非洲，而且，用的办法比这更稳妥。……也许一个月，半年，最多一年，某位探险家无疑会……。”</p> 
<p>这番暗示恰恰起了反作用。听到这些话，弗格森博士急得发抖。</p> 
<p>“可怜的肯尼迪，你究竟要怎样？虚伪的朋友，你难道想让别人去得到这荣誉吗？我怎么能背叛我的过去，在这么点小困难面前退缩呢？英国政府和伦敦皇家学会为我做了一切，我却卑怯、迟疑地向他们道声谢谢，说我改变主意不去了。这种事，我决不会做的！”</p> 
<p>“但是……，”非常偏爱这个词的肯尼迪又想开口。</p> 
<p>“但是，”博士抢过话头，“你难道不知道我的旅行有助于目前正在非洲探险的人们取得成功？你一点不知道又有几位探险家正向非洲中心进发？”</p> 
<p>“不过……”</p> 
<p>“好好听我说，肯尼迪，瞧瞧这张地图。”</p> 
<p>肯尼迪顺从地把目光投向地图。</p> 
<p>“沿着尼罗河往上走，”弗格森说。</p> 
<p>“往上走。”苏格兰人听从地答。</p> 
<p>“到刚多科罗。”</p> 
<p>“到了。”</p> 
<p>这时肯尼迪想，这样的旅行要是在地图上进行多容易。</p> 
<p>“拿着这只圆规的一只脚，”博士接着说，“把它放在这座城上。最勇敢的人最远也不过到此。”</p> 
<p>“放上了。”</p> 
<p>“现在，沿着海湾寻找处在南纬的桑给巴尔岛。”</p> 
<p>“找到了。”</p> 
<p>“现在，顺着这条平行线走到卡泽赫。”</p> 
<p>“成了。”</p> 
<p>“沿着33度经度线往上直到乌克雷维湖的湖口，就是斯皮克上尉到过的那个地方。”</p> 
<p>“我到了！嘿，有点过头，掉到湖里了。”</p> 
<p>“好！你知道根据沿湖居民提供的资料，有理由作出什么推论吗？”</p> 
<p>“我哪料得到？”</p> 
<p>“就是，既然湖的南岸处在南纬2度30分的地方，湖面同样应延伸到赤道北面2度半，就是说它的北岸应在北纬2度30分的地方。”</p> 
<p>“真的？”</p> 
<p>“假定一条河从湖北岸流出。即使这条河不是尼罗河，也必然汇入尼罗河。”</p> 
<p>“可真够怪的。”</p> 
<p>“假定把你那个圆规的另一只脚放在乌克雷维湖的这一岸边。”</p> 
<p>“放好了，弗格森老友。”</p> 
<p>“你算算两点之间有几度？”</p> 
<p>“差不多2度。”</p> 
<p>“你知道这有多少距离吗，肯尼迪？”</p> 
<p>“一点不知道。”</p> 
<p>“勉强算得上200英里，也就是说没多远。”</p> 
<p>“几乎没多远，弗格森。”</p> 
<p>“不过，你知道眼下那里发生的事吗？”</p> 
<p>“不，拿我的生命发誓，不知道！”</p> 
<p>“好吧，听我说！情况是这样的：地理学会认为考察斯皮克发现的这个湖非常重要。在学会的支持下，中尉，也就是现在的斯皮克上尉联合了在印度军队服役的格兰特①上尉。两人领导了一只人数众多，经费充足的探险队。他们的任务是沿该湖而上， 再次到刚多科罗。探险队得到了一笔5千多英镑的经费。还有，开普敦总督拨出一队霍屯督士兵由他两人指挥。他们已于1860年底由桑给巴尔出发。与此同时，英国人约翰·佩特利克②，驻卡尔图姆的英国领事收到了英国外交部寄来的约700英镑款子。 他必须备好一条蒸汽船，装上充足的生活必需品，然后，把船开到刚多科罗。他将在那儿等候斯皮克上尉的骆驼队，给他们提供补给。”</p> 
<p>①1827—1892，英国军人，探险家，1864年出版日记《跨越非洲记行》。</p> 
<p>②1813—1882，威尔士商人兼探险家，调查过尼罗河西侧支流，着有游记《埃及、苏丹和中非》。</p> 
<p>“想得挺周到的。”肯尼迪说。</p> 
<p>“你很清楚，肯尼迪。要是我们想参加这项探险工作，就得抓紧。而且，这还不算完。当这些人一步步地朝着尼罗河发源地前进时，其他一些旅行家们正勇敢地向非洲心脏挺进。”</p> 
<p>“步行吗？”</p> 
<p>“步行。”博士应道，根本没有注意到肯尼迪的暗示，“克拉普夫博士打算通过赤道南边的乔伯河向西推进。德肯①男爵已离开蒙巴兹，考察了肯尼迪山和乞力马札罗山，现在正向非洲的中央地带深入。”</p> 
<p>①1833—1865，德国探险家，攀登乞力马扎罗山的第一个欧洲人。</p> 
<p>“还是步行？”</p> 
<p>“是的，是步行，或骑骡子。”</p> 
<p>“不过，在我看来完全是一码事。”肯尼迪反驳道。</p> 
<p>“最后，”弗格森博士接着说，“还有德·霍伊格林，奥地利驻卡尔图姆副领事。他刚组织了一支非常重要的探险队。探险队的首要目的是寻找旅行家弗格尔。他于1853年被派往苏丹参加巴尔特博士的探险工作。1856年弗格尔离开了博尔努。他决定去考察位于乍得湖和达尔富尔高原之间的那块尚不为人知的地区。然而从那以后， 他就没有再出现过。1860年6月抵达亚历山大城的一些信中说，他被瓦代国国王下令杀死了。但是，其他一些由哈特曼博寄给这位旅行家父亲的信中却说，据博尔努一位居民的叙述，弗格尔只是被关押在瓦拉，希望并没完全破灭。以萨克森—科堡—哥达摄政公爵为主席的一个委员会成立了。我的朋友彼德曼是该委员会的秘书。全国捐助的一笔钱组织了一支远征队。队中聚集了许多学者。德·霍伊格林爵士已在6月份由马苏阿动身。 在寻找弗格尔踪迹的同时，他得勘察包括尼罗河与乍得湖之间的整个地区。换句话说，把斯皮克上尉的活动与巴尔特博士的工作联系起来。到那时非洲大陆将被从东到西走遍了①。”</p> 
<p>①弗格森博士启程时，听说德·霍伊格林爵士经过数次讨论后，选择了另外一条不同于原先确定的路线，因此探险队的领导权转交给了辛格爵士。——原注</p> 
<p>“那好啊！”苏格兰人又嚷了起来，“既然一切都进行得那么顺利，我们还去那儿干什么？”</p> 
<p>弗格森博士耸了耸肩，没有回答。</p>
