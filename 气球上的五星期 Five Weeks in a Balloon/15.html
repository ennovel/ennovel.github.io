<p>Kazeh, an important point in Central Africa, is not a city; in truth, there are no cities in the interior. Kazeh is but a collection of six extensive excavations. There are enclosed a few houses and slave-huts, with little courtyards and small gardens, carefully cultivated with onions, potatoes, cucumbers, pumpkins, and mushrooms, of perfect flavor, growing most luxuriantly.</p> 
<p>The Unyamwezy is the country of the Moon--above all the rest, the fertile and magnificent garden-spot of Africa. In its centre is the district of Unyanembe--a delicious region, where some families of Omani, who are of very pure Arabic origin, live in luxurious idleness.</p> 
<p>They have, for a long period, held the commerce between the interior of Africa and Arabia: they trade in gums, ivory, fine muslin, and slaves. Their caravans traverse these equatorial regions on all sides; and they even make their way to the coast in search of those articles of luxury and enjoyment which the wealthy merchants covet; while the latter, surrounded by their wives and their attendants, lead in this charming country the least disturbed and most horizontal of lives--always stretched at full length, laughing, smoking, or sleeping.</p> 
<p>Around these excavations are numerous native dwellings; wide, open spaces for the markets; fields of cannabis and datura; superb trees and depths of freshest shade--such is Kazeh!</p> 
<p>There, too, is held the general rendezvous of the caravans --those of the south, with their slaves and their freightage of ivory; and those of the west, which export cotton, glassware, and trinkets, to the tribes of the great lakes.</p> 
<p>So in the market-place there reigns perpetual excitement, a nameless hubbub, made up of the cries of mixed-breed porters and carriers, the beating of drums, and the twanging of horns, the neighing of mules, the braying of donkeys, the singing of women, the squalling of children, and the banging of the huge rattan, wielded by the jemadar or leader of the caravans, who beats time to this pastoral symphony.</p> 
<p>There, spread forth, without regard to order--indeed, we may say, in charming disorder--are the showy stuffs, the glass beads, the ivory tusks, the rhinoceros'-teeth, the shark's-teeth, the honey, the tobacco, and the cotton of these regions, to be purchased at the strangest of bargains by customers in whose eyes each article has a price only in proportion to the desire it excites to possess it.</p> 
<p>All at once this agitation, movement and noise stopped as though by magic. The balloon had just come in sight, far aloft in the sky, where it hovered majestically for a few moments, and then descended slowly, without deviating from its perpendicular. Men, women, children, merchants and slaves, Arabs and negroes, as suddenly disappeared within the "tembes" and the huts.</p> 
<p>"My dear doctor," said Kennedy, "if we continue to produce such a sensation as this, we shall find some difficulty in establishing commercial relations with the people hereabouts."</p> 
<p>"There's one kind of trade that we might carry on, though, easily enough," said Joe; "and that would be to go down there quietly, and walk off with the best of the goods, without troubling our heads about the merchants; we'd get rich that way!"</p> 
<p>"Ah!" said the doctor, "these natives are a little scared at first; but they won't be long in coming back, either through suspicion or through curiosity."</p> 
<p>"Do you really think so, doctor?"</p> 
<p>"Well, we'll see pretty soon. But it wouldn't be prudent to go too near to them, for the balloon is not iron-clad, and is, therefore, not proof against either an arrow or a bullet."</p> 
<p>"Then you expect to hold a parley with these blacks?"</p> 
<p>"If we can do so safely, why should we not? There must be some Arab merchants here at Kazeh, who are better informed than the rest, and not so barbarous. I remember that Burton and Speke had nothing but praises to utter concerning the hospitality of these people; so we might, at least, make the venture."</p> 
<p>The balloon having, meanwhile, gradually approached the ground, one of the anchors lodged in the top of a tree near the market-place.</p> 
<p>By this time the whole population had emerged from their hiding-places stealthily, thrusting their heads out first. Several "waganga," recognizable by their badges of conical shellwork, came boldly forward. They were the sorcerers of the place. They bore in their girdles small gourds, coated with tallow, and several other articles of witchcraft, all of them, by-the-way, most professionally filthy.</p> 
<p>Little by little the crowd gathered beside them, the women and children grouped around them, the drums renewed their deafening uproar, hands were violently clapped together, and then raised toward the sky.</p> 
<p>"That's their style of praying," said the doctor; "and, if I'm not mistaken, we're going to be called upon to play a great part."</p> 
<p>"Well, sir, play it!"</p> 
<p>"You, too, my good Joe--perhaps you're to be a god!"</p> 
<p>"Well, master, that won't trouble me much. I like a little flattery!"</p> 
<p>At this moment, one of the sorcerers, a "myanga," made a sign, and all the clamor died away into the profoundest silence. He then addressed a few words to the strangers, but in an unknown tongue.</p> 
<p>Dr. Ferguson, not having understood them, shouted some sentences in Arabic, at a venture, and was immediately answered in that language.</p> 
<p>The speaker below then delivered himself of a very copious harangue, which was also very flowery and very gravely listened to by his audience. From it the doctor was not slow in learning that the balloon was mistaken for nothing less than the moon in person, and that the amiable goddess in question had condescended to approach the town with her three sons--an honor that would never be forgotten in this land so greatly loved by the god of day.</p> 
<p>The doctor responded, with much dignity, that the moon made her provincial tour every thousand years, feeling the necessity of showing herself nearer at hand to her worshippers. He, therefore, begged them not to be disturbed by her presence, but to take advantage of it to make known all their wants and longings.</p> 
<p>The sorcerer, in his turn, replied that the sultan, the "mwani," who had been sick for many years, implored the aid of heaven, and he invited the son of the moon to visit him.</p> 
<p>The doctor acquainted his companions with the invitation.</p> 
<p>"And you are going to call upon this negro king?" asked Kennedy.</p> 
<p>"Undoubtedly so; these people appear well disposed; the air is calm; there is not a breath of wind, and we have nothing to fear for the balloon?"</p> 
<p>"But, what will you do?"</p> 
<p>"Be quiet on that score, my dear Dick. With a little medicine, I shall work my way through the affair!"</p> 
<p>Then, addressing the crowd, he said:</p> 
<p>"The moon, taking compassion on the sovereign who is so dear to the children of Unyamwezy, has charged us to restore him to health. Let him prepare to receive us!"</p> 
<p>The clamor, the songs and demonstrations of all kinds increased twofold, and the whole immense ants' nest of black heads was again in motion.</p> 
<p>"Now, my friends," said Dr. Ferguson, "we must look out for every thing beforehand; we may be forced to leave this at any moment, unexpectedly, and be off with extra speed. Dick had better remain, therefore, in the car, and keep the cylinder warm so as to secure a sufficient ascensional force for the balloon. The anchor is solidly fastened, and there is nothing to fear in that respect. I shall descend, and Joe will go with me, only that he must remain at the foot of the ladder."</p> 
<p>"What! are you going alone into that blackamoor's den?"</p> 
<p>"How! doctor, am I not to go with you?"</p> 
<p>"No! I shall go alone; these good folks imagine that the goddess of the moon has come to see them, and their superstition protects me; so have no fear, and each one remain at the post that I have assigned to him."</p> 
<p>"Well, since you wish it," sighed Kennedy.</p> 
<p>"Look closely to the dilation of the gas."</p> 
<p>"Agreed!"</p> 
<p>By this time the shouts of the natives had swelled to double volume as they vehemently implored the aid of the heavenly powers.</p> 
<p>"There, there," said Joe, "they're rather rough in their orders to their good moon and her divine sons."</p> 
<p>The doctor, equipped with his travelling medicine-chest, descended to the ground, preceded by Joe, who kept a straight countenance and looked as grave and knowing as the circumstances of the case required. He then seated himself at the foot of the ladder in the Arab fashion, with his legs crossed under him, and a portion of the crowd collected around him in a circle, at respectful distances.</p> 
<p>In the meanwhile the doctor, escorted to the sound of savage instruments, and with wild religious dances, slowly proceeded toward the royal "tembe," situated a considerable distance outside of the town. It was about three o'clock, and the sun was shining brilliantly. In fact, what less could it do upon so grand an occasion!</p> 
<p>The doctor stepped along with great dignity, the waganga surrounding him and keeping off the crowd. He was soon joined by the natural son of the sultan, a handsomely-built young fellow, who, according to the custom of the country, was the sole heir of the paternal goods, to the exclusion of the old man's legitimate children. He prostrated himself before the son of the moon, but the latter graciously raised him to his feet.</p> 
<p>Three-quarters of an hour later, through shady paths, surrounded by all the luxuriance of tropical vegetation, this enthusiastic procession arrived at the sultan's palace, a sort of square edifice called ititenya, and situated on the slope of a hill.</p> 
<p>A kind of veranda, formed by the thatched roof, adorned the outside, supported upon wooden pillars, which had some pretensions to being carved. Long lines of dark-red clay decorated the walls in characters that strove to reproduce the forms of men and serpents, the latter better imitated, of course, than the former. The roofing of this abode did not rest directly upon the walls, and the air could, therefore, circulate freely, but windows there were none, and the door hardly deserved the name.</p> 
<p>Dr. Ferguson was received with all the honors by the guards and favorites of the sultan; these were men of a fine race, the Wanyamwezi so-called, a pure type of the central African populations, strong, robust, well-made, and in splendid condition. Their hair, divided into a great number of small tresses, fell over their shoulders, and by means of black-and-blue incisions they had tattooed their cheeks from the temples to the mouth. Their ears, frightfully distended, held dangling to them disks of wood and plates of gum copal. They were clad in brilliantly-painted cloths, and the soldiers were armed with the saw-toothed war-club, the bow and arrows barbed and poisoned with the juice of the euphorbium, the cutlass, the "sima," a long sabre (also with saw-like teeth), and some small battle-axes.</p> 
<p>The doctor advanced into the palace, and there, notwithstanding the sultan's illness, the din, which was terrific before, redoubled the instant that he arrived. He noticed, at the lintels of the door, some rabbits' tails and zebras' manes, suspended as talismans. He was received by the whole troop of his majesty's wives, to the harmonious accords of the "upatu," a sort of cymbal made of the bottom of a copper kettle, and to the uproar of the "kilindo," a drum five feet high, hollowed out from the trunk of a tree, and hammered by the ponderous, horny fists of two jet-black virtuosi.</p> 
<p>Most of the women were rather good-looking, and they laughed and chattered merrily as they smoked their tobacco and "thang" in huge black pipes. They seemed to be well made, too, under the long robes that they wore gracefully flung about their persons, and carried a sort of "kilt" woven from the fibres of calabash fastened around their girdles.</p> 
<p>Six of them were not the least merry of the party, although put aside from the rest, and reserved for a cruel fate. On the death of the sultan, they were to be buried alive with him, so as to occupy and divert his mind during the period of eternal solitude.</p> 
<p>Dr. Ferguson, taking in the whole scene at a rapid glance, approached the wooden couch on which the sultan lay reclining. There he saw a man of about forty, completely brutalized by orgies of every description, and in a condition that left little or nothing to be done. The sickness that had afflicted him for so many years was simply perpetual drunkenness. The royal sot had nearly lost all consciousness, and all the ammonia in the world would not have set him on his feet again.</p> 
<p>His favorites and the women kept on bended knees during this solemn visit. By means of a few drops of powerful cordial, the doctor for a moment reanimated the imbruted carcass that lay before him. The sultan stirred, and, for a dead body that had given no sign whatever of life for several hours previously, this symptom was received with a tremendous repetition of shouts and cries in the doctor's honor.</p> 
<p>The latter, who had seen enough of it by this time, by a rapid motion put aside his too demonstrative admirers and went out of the palace, directing his steps immediately toward the balloon, for it was now six o'clock in the evening.</p> 
<p>Joe, during his absence, had been quietly waiting at the foot of the ladder, where the crowd paid him their most humble respects. Like a genuine son of the moon, he let them keep on. For a divinity, he had the air of a very clever sort of fellow, by no means proud, nay, even pleasingly familiar with the young negresses, who seemed never to tire of looking at him. Besides, he went so far as to chat agreeably with them.</p> 
<p>"Worship me, ladies! worship me!" he said to them. "I'm a clever sort of devil, if I am the son of a goddess."</p> 
<p>They brought him propitiatory gifts, such as are usually deposited in the fetich huts or mzimu. These gifts consisted of stalks of barley and of "pombe." Joe considered himself in duty bound to taste the latter species of strong beer, but his palate, although accustomed to gin and whiskey, could not withstand the strength of the new beverage, and he had to make a horrible grimace, which his dusky friends took to be a benevolent smile.</p> 
<p>Thereupon, the young damsels, conjoining their voices in a drawling chant, began to dance around him with the utmost gravity.</p> 
<p>"Ah! you're dancing, are you?" said he. "Well, I won't be behind you in politeness, and so I'll give you one of my country reels."</p> 
<p>So at it he went, in one of the wildest jigs that ever was seen, twisting, turning, and jerking himself in all directions; dancing with his hands, dancing with his body, dancing with his knees, dancing with his feet; describing the most fearful contortions and extravagant evolutions; throwing himself into incredible attitudes; grimacing beyond all belief, and, in fine giving his savage admirers a strange idea of the style of ballet adopted by the deities in the moon.</p> 
<p>Then, the whole collection of blacks, naturally as imitative as monkeys, at once reproduced all his airs and graces, his leaps and shakes and contortions; they did not lose a single gesticulation; they did not forget an attitude; and the result was, such a pandemonium of movement, noise, and excitement, as it would be out of the question even feebly to describe. But, in the very midst of the fun, Joe saw the doctor approaching.</p> 
<p>The latter was coming at full speed, surrounded by a yelling and disorderly throng. The chiefs and sorcerers seemed to be highly excited. They were close upon the doctor's heels, crowding and threatening him.</p> 
<p>Singular reaction! What had happened? Had the sultan unluckily perished in the hands of his celestial physician?</p> 
<p>Kennedy, from his post of observation, saw the danger without knowing what had caused it, and the balloon, powerfully urged by the dilation of the gas, strained and tugged at the ropes that held it as though impatient to soar away.</p> 
<p>The doctor had got as far as the foot of the ladder. A superstitious fear still held the crowd aloof and hindered them from committing any violence on his person. He rapidly scaled the ladder, and Joe followed him with his usual agility.</p> 
<p>"Not a moment to lose!" said the doctor. "Don't attempt to let go the anchor! We'll cut the cord! Follow me!"</p> 
<p>"But what's the matter?" asked Joe, clambering into the car.</p> 
<p>"What's happened?" questioned Kennedy, rifle in hand.</p> 
<p>"Look!" replied the doctor, pointing to the horizon.</p> 
<p>"Well?" ejaculated the Scot.</p> 
<p>"Well! the moon!"</p> 
<p>And, in fact, there was the moon rising red and magnificent, a globe of fire in a field of blue! It was she, indeed--she and the balloon!--both in one sky!</p> 
<p>Either there were two moons, then, or these strangers were imposters, designing scamps, false deities!</p> 
<p>Such were the very natural reflections of the crowd, and hence the reaction in their feelings.</p> 
<p>Joe could not, for the life of him, keep in a roar of laughter; and the population of Kazeh, comprehending that their prey was slipping through their clutches, set up prolonged howlings, aiming, the while, their bows and muskets at the balloon.</p> 
<p>But one of the sorcerers made a sign, and all the weapons were lowered. He then began to climb into the tree, intending to seize the rope and bring the machine to the ground.</p> 
<p>Joe leaned out with a hatchet ready. "Shall I cut away?" said he.</p> 
<p>"No; wait a moment," replied the doctor.</p> 
<p>"But this black?"</p> 
<p>"We may, perhaps, save our anchor--and I hold a great deal by that. There'll always be time enough to cut loose."</p> 
<p>The sorcerer, having climbed to the right place, worked so vigorously that he succeeded in detaching the anchor, and the latter, violently jerked, at that moment, by the start of the balloon, caught the rascal between the limbs, and carried him off astride of it through the air.</p> 
<p>The stupefaction of the crowd was indescribable as they saw one of their waganga thus whirled away into space.</p> 
<p>"Huzza!" roared Joe, as the balloon--thanks to its ascensional force--shot up higher into the sky, with increased rapidity.</p> 
<p>"He holds on well," said Kennedy; "a little trip will do him good."</p> 
<p>"Shall we let this darky drop all at once?" inquired Joe.</p> 
<p>"Oh no," replied the doctor, "we'll let him down easily; and I warrant me that, after such an adventure, the power of the wizard will be enormously enhanced in the sight of his comrades."</p> 
<p>"Why, I wouldn't put it past them to make a god of him!" said Joe, with a laugh.</p> 
<p>The Victoria, by this time, had risen to the height of one thousand feet, and the black hung to the rope with desperate energy. He had become completely silent, and his eyes were fixed, for his terror was blended with amazement. A light west wind was sweeping the balloon right over the town, and far beyond it.</p> 
<p>Half an hour later, the doctor, seeing the country deserted, moderated the flame of his cylinder, and descended toward the ground. At twenty feet above the turf, the affrighted sorcerer made up his mind in a twinkling: he let himself drop, fell on his feet, and scampered off at a furious pace toward Kazeh; while the balloon, suddenly relieved of his weight, again shot up on her course.</p> 
<p>卡泽赫——喧闹的市场——天空出现“维多利亚号”——“旺岗加”们——月亮的儿子——博士出诊——居民——王宫“当贝”——苏丹的王妃——醉鬼国王——乔受到崇拜——在月亮上如何跳舞——态度变了——双月当空——神的威严垮了</p> 
<p>卡泽赫虽是个中非重镇，却一点不像城市。老实说，非洲内地没有一个真正意义上的城市。卡泽赫不过是六个宽敞的洞穴的总称。洞穴周围是一些奴隶住的茅房草屋。每个房屋后有小小的院落和精心耕作的小菜园。园里种的洋葱、番薯、茄子、南瓜和美味香蕈长势喜人。</p> 
<p>乌尼央维基是月亮国最好的一部分，是非洲美丽富饶的大花园。乌尼央维基的中心区是乌尼亚南贝，这是个美妙的地方。几户阿曼人在这儿过着懒散的生活。他们都是些纯阿拉伯人。</p> 
<p>他们很早就开始了在非洲内地和阿拉伯国家的买卖活动：贩卖橡胶、象牙、印花棉布和奴隶。他们的骆驼商队踏遍了赤道周围的地区，而且还去沿海地区为富商巨贾带来奢侈品和消遣物件。这些有钱人妻妾成群，奴仆如云，时刻躺在那儿，不是说笑，就是抽烟，要么睡觉，在这富庶迷人的地方终日过着无所事事的生活。</p> 
<p>这些洞穴的周围是：众多土著人的茅屋，几处充当市场的宽敞空地，几畦长着大麻和曼陀罗的田块，一些漂亮的大树和凉爽的阴影地。这就是卡泽赫的外貌。</p> 
<p>这里也是骆驼商队的汇集地：南方的骆驼商队带来了他们的奴隶和象牙；西方的骆驼商队带来向大湖地区各个部落兜售的棉花和玻璃器皿。</p> 
<p>因此，市场上总是熙熙攘攘，无比嘈杂：混血儿脚夫的喊声、鼓声、号声、骡子的叫声、驴子的吼声、女人的歌声、孩子的哭声，再加上仿佛在为这曲“乡村交响乐”打拍子的骆驼队头头抽动藤条的响声。各种声音此起彼伏，交织在一起，溶汇成一片经久不息喧嚣。</p> 
<p>这里乱糟糟地，甚至可以说乱而有序地摆着各种摊位：花花绿绿的布匹、玻璃珠、犀牛牙、蜂蜜、烟草、棉花，五花八门，应有尽有。这里流行着最奇特的交易习惯：每件物品的价值全凭物品能在多大程度上激起买主的购买欲来决定。</p> 
<p>突然，这种喧闹，这种活动，这种嘈杂全静止了。原来，“维多利亚号”在空中出现了。气球庄严地飘荡着，缓缓地垂直下降。男人、女人、孩子、奴隶、商人、阿拉伯人和黑人转眼间全不见了。他们都钻进了王宫或草房。</p> 
<p>“亲爱的弗格森，”肯尼迪说，“如果我们继续这样下去，总是引起骚动，那么，就很难与这些人做生意了。”</p> 
<p>“还里有一宗非常简单的买卖可以做。”乔说，“那就是安安稳稳地下去，不用去理会商人，只管把值钱货带走就成了。这样，我们会发大财。”</p> 
<p>“瞧你说的！”博士反驳道，“这些土著人最初感到害怕，但是出于迷信和好奇，他们马上就会回来的。”</p> 
<p>“您以为会吗，主人？”</p> 
<p>“咱们等着瞧吧。不过最好谨慎点，别太靠近他们。‘维多利亚号’可不是装甲做的气球。它既挡不住子弹也经不住箭射。”</p> 
<p>“那么，亲爱的弗格森，你打算与这些黑人进行谈判吗？”</p> 
<p>“如果可能的话，为什么不呢？”博士答道，“也许住在卡泽赫的阿拉伯商人受过教育，不那么野蛮。我记得，伯顿先生和斯皮克先生曾夸过这个城市的居民好客，因此，我们不妨碰碰运气。”</p> 
<p>“维多利亚号”不知不觉接近了地面。一只锚勾住了集市广场旁边一棵树的树顶。此时，所有的居民又都从草房里走了出来，脸上带着疑虑的神情。好几位“旺岗加”（从他们身上披挂着圆锥形螺壳这一标记就可认出来）大着胆子向前移动。他们是当地的巫师。他们的腰间挂着一些用油涂过的小黑葫芦和各种法器。这些物件虽然不干净，却又十分正经。</p> 
<p>巫师们的身旁渐渐地聚起了人群。妇女和孩子们围在巫师的周围。鼓竞相“咚咚”地敲了起来。他们拍拍手，然后把手举向天空。</p> 
<p>“这是他们祷告的方式。”弗格森博士说，“如果我没猜错的话，咱们恐怕要演一出好戏了。”</p> 
<p>“好极了，先生。您就演吧。”</p> 
<p>“还有你呢，亲爱的乔，你或许要当一尊神了。”</p> 
<p>“哇！先生，我才不担心这个呢。有人供奉，我更高兴。”</p> 
<p>这时，其中一位巫师做了个手势，顿时，所有叫喊停止了。全场鸦雀无声。这位“米扬卡”向旅行家们说了几句话，但是谁也不知道他用的是什么语言。</p> 
<p>弗格森博士虽然没有听懂，仍不管三七二十一说了几句阿拉伯语。他的话，立即招来巫师的阿拉伯语回答。</p> 
<p>这位有口才的巫师向3位旅行家说了一大堆美好动听的恭维话。博士马上明白，“维多利亚号” 气球确实被看成月亮神本人了。这位可爱的女神能带着她的3个儿子惠顾这个城。在这块得到太阳喜爱的土地上，这将是永不忘怀的荣耀。</p> 
<p>博士非常神圣地回答说，月亮女神每1000年周游一趟，巡视她属下的人民和土地。她感到需要到崇拜者身旁展现一下自己的风采。博士因此请大家不要拘束，趁女神降临之际，讲讲自己的需要和愿望。</p> 
<p>巫师回答说，苏丹“姆瓦尼”已经病了好几年，祈求上苍的保佑。随即，巫师请月亮的儿子们去看望苏丹。</p> 
<p>博士把这个事情告诉了同伴。</p> 
<p>“这么说，你打算看望这位黑人国王了？”猎人说。</p> 
<p>“当然了，我觉得这些人没有恶意。现在大气是静止的，一点风也没有。我们完全不必担心气球。”</p> 
<p>“可是，你又能怎么办呢？”</p> 
<p>“放心吧，亲爱的肯尼迪。用一点点药，我就能脱身了。”</p> 
<p>随后，博士对众人说：</p> 
<p>“月亮女神怜悯乌尼央维基儿女们所敬爱的国王。她委派我们来治愈他的病。现在，让他准备迎接我们吧！”</p> 
<p>全场响起了更加响亮的欢呼声和歌声。这黑压压的一大片人全都又动了起来。</p> 
<p>“现在，朋友们，”弗格森博士说，“什么都得想到。时间一到，我们就得迅速离开。肯尼迪留在吊篮里，并且要照看好氢氧喷嘴的火头，使气球保持有足够的升力。锚要固定牢。没有什么可担心的。我现在下到地面去。乔陪我下去。你只能待在软梯下面。”</p> 
<p>“怎么！你一个人去那个黑家伙家吗？”肯尼迪有些不放心。</p> 
<p>“怎么！弗格森先生，”乔大叫，“您不要我跟随您到底吗？”</p> 
<p>“不要，我一个人去就行了。既然这些诚实的人想着是他们伟大的月亮女神来探望他们，我就能得到迷信的保护，不会有事的。你们什么也别怕，各自待在我说的岗位上吧。”</p> 
<p>“既然你要这么做，也只好这么办了。”猎人答道。</p> 
<p>“请你注意氢气的膨胀。”</p> 
<p>“放心吧。”</p> 
<p>土著人的喊声更响了。他们竭力祈求上苍的恩泽。</p> 
<p>“您听，您听！”乔说，“我觉得他们对宽容的月亮女神和她神圣的儿子们未免有点太蛮不讲理了。”</p> 
<p>博士带上他的旅行药箱，跟在乔后面下了吊篮。乔煞有其事地极力摆出一付严肃、庄重的模样，按照阿拉伯人的方式盘起双腿，坐在了垂下的绳梯旁。随即，一群人毕恭毕敬地围住了他。</p> 
<p>与此同时，弗格森博士被宗教仪仗队簇拥着，在乐器吹打声的引导下，缓缓前往王宫“坦贝” 。王宫在城外相当远的地方。这时已是下午3点钟左右，太阳闪着熠熠光辉。在这种情形下，博士只有按部就班地做。</p> 
<p>他庄严地走着，巫师们围在他周围，为他挡住人群。很快，苏丹的一位私生子前来迎接他。这位少年长得相当漂亮。按照当地的风俗，除了合法子女之外，他是他父亲全部财产的唯一继承人。少年在月亮的儿子面前匍伏下来，月亮的儿子马上动作优雅地把他扶起。</p> 
<p>这只喜气洋洋的仪仗队伍沿着绿荫如盖的小道，穿行于枝繁叶茂的热带植物间，于三刻钟后来到了苏丹的王宫。这座被称作“依提台尼亚”的王宫为方形建筑结构。它座落在一个山丘的山坡上。王宫茅草顶的屋檐向外突出，下面用一些雕刻过的木柱支撑着，环绕房子形成一圈风格独特的回廊。墙上点缀着的一些长长的红粘土线条，极力勾勒出人和蛇的模样。自然，其中蛇形图案比人形图案更为逼真。这种房子的屋顶与四面的墙壁不是直接连在一起的，所以空气可以自由流通。再者，墙上没有窗子，只有一扇小门。</p> 
<p>侍卫们和诸位宠臣毕恭毕敬地把弗格森博士迎了进去。这些人都是乌尼央维基部落出类拔萃的人才，是纯中非人。他们个个英俊魁梧、强壮有力。长长的头发梳成许多小辫子披在肩上。他们的面颊上，从鬓角一直到嘴划出一道道条纹，切口都染成蓝色或黑色。极其松弛的耳朵上坠着一些木圆盘和琵琶树脂做的薄片。他们穿着色彩鲜艳的粗布衣。侍卫们手持标枪、弓、浸过毒草汁，带有倒刺的箭、猎刀、带锯齿的长刀“西姆”和小战斧。</p> 
<p>博士走进了王宫。尽管苏丹有病，里面仍然吵得厉害。看见博士来到，吵嚷声更响了。博士注意到门楣上按避邪的方式挂着一些兔子尾巴、斑马鬃。在“乌帕突”（一种用铜壶底做的铙钹）的和谐敲击声和“基兰多”（一种挖空树干做成的鼓，高5尺，由俩位鼓手用拳头敲）的擂打声中，陛下的一队王妃接待了博士。</p> 
<p>这些女人大部分看上去很漂亮。她们手拿大黑烟斗，笑眯眯地抽着烟和一种植物叶。雅致地打着褶子的长长连衣裙使她们的体形显得更加优美。围着她们那纤纤的细腰，系着一条用葫芦纤维编成的“吉尔特”。</p> 
<p>其中6位女人同其他人一样高高兴兴地有说有笑， 尽管她们待在一旁，准备接受残酷的死刑。一旦苏丹死了，她们将被活埋在他的身边，供他在冥冥阴间，寂寞孤独中消遣取乐。</p> 
<p>弗格森博士向全场扫了一眼后，径直走到统治者的木榻前。床上躺着一位40岁左右的男子。因酗酒和荒淫过度，他已成为一具仅存一丝气息的僵尸。使他康复根本就没有可能，因为，拖了几年的这种疾病，只能是长年醉酒的结果。这位醉鬼国王几乎失去了知觉，就是全世界的阿莫尼亚水①都用上也无法使他重新站立起来。</p> 
<p>①即氨水，在当时的欧洲流行用它来作兴奋剂刺激病人苏醒过来。</p> 
<p>“月亮之子”庄严地探视国王时，宠臣们和女人们全都双膝跪地，弓下腰等候着结果。博士往苏丹嘴里滴了几滴强烈兴奋剂，使这具没有知觉的身躯有了片刻的生气。苏丹动了一动。几个小时来，已没有丝毫迹象证明苏丹还活着。对于这么一个死了一般的人来说，能够动一下实在是个奇迹。顿时，呼声四起，一浪高过一浪，以向医治者表示敬意。</p> 
<p>对这一切已感到厌倦的博士，急走几步，避开这些感情极度外露的崇拜者们。他出了王宫便向“维多利亚号”走去。这时，已是下午6点钟了。</p> 
<p>博士不在的这几个小时里，乔坐在绳梯旁，安心地等待着。周围的土著人纷纷向他表示自己最大的敬意。作为“月亮之子”，乔待在那里任由他们朝拜。对于一位神来说，他的样子看上去更像个诚实的人，没有任何傲气，甚至还和那些不愿让他盯着看的非洲少女套近乎呢。他花言巧语地对她们说：</p> 
<p>“崇拜吧，姑娘们，崇拜吧。虽说我是女神的儿子，但我还是位大好人呢！”</p> 
<p>供品献给了他。通常这些供物都是摆放在“姆基米”或供奉偶像的草房中的。它们是些大麦穗和“彭贝”酒。乔认为自己应尝一尝这种烈性啤酒。但是，尽管他的喉咙喝惯了杜松子酒和威士忌，仍受不了这种饮料的猛劲。他做了个可怕的鬼脸，可围观者竟把这当成了亲切的微笑！</p> 
<p>后来，年轻的姑娘们唱着一首节奏缓慢单调的曲子，围着他跳起一种庄重的舞蹈来。</p> 
<p>“哇！你们跳舞啊！”他兴奋地说，“好啊！我不想欠你们的情。我这就让你们见识见识我们国家的舞蹈吧。”</p> 
<p>于是，他跳起一种令人头昏目眩的快步舞来。他又是扭腰，又是弓背，又是伸胳膊，又是蹬腿，一会儿前仰后合，一会儿左右摇摆，跺跺脚，曲曲膝，挥挥手，扭扭头，全身的部位无一不派上了用场；稀奇古怪的花样，诸多让人意料不到的舞姿，一一展示在众人面前，其间他甚至还做了几个怪诞的鬼脸。他所做的一切给这些土著人这样一种看法：神仙在月亮上就是如此跳舞的。</p> 
<p>这时，所有在场的非洲人像猴子一样跟着他模仿起来。他们很善于模仿，很快就学会了乔的风格，蹦跳和扭动。他们没有漏掉一个动作，没有忘记一个姿势。于是，整个场地乱成了一团，人们又是喊又是叫，那股骚动和狂热劲儿实在是难以形容。就在闹腾得正欢的时候，乔发现博士回来了。</p> 
<p>博士在吼叫和杂乱的人群中急匆匆地走回来。巫师和酋长们似乎怒气匆匆。他们围着博士，穷追猛问，不住地威胁。</p> 
<p>糟糕！他们变卦了！出了什么事？难道苏丹不巧死在神医手中了？</p> 
<p>肯尼迪从他的岗位上看到了危险，但不明白是何原因。此时，被氢气膨胀得鼓鼓的气球紧紧扯着锚索，似乎急不可待地想升到空中去。</p> 
<p>博士终于来到绳梯旁。迷信的恐惧心理仍束缚着人群，使他们不敢对博士采取过激行动。博士快捷地爬上绳梯，乔也伶俐地跟了上来。</p> 
<p>“一分钟也不能耽搁，”主人向乔吩咐道，“用不着摘锚了！我们等会儿把锚索砍断！快跟我上来！”</p> 
<p>“哦！到底怎么回事？”乔边爬进吊篮，边问。</p> 
<p>“发生了什么事？”肯尼迪手里握着马枪问。</p> 
<p>“瞧！”博士指着地平线答道。</p> 
<p>“怎么了？”猎人仍迷惑不解。</p> 
<p>“看清楚！月亮！”</p> 
<p>的确，月亮又红又大，像一个火球在天际冉冉升起。正是月亮！它和“维多利亚号”是两码事！</p> 
<p>要么，有两个月亮；要么，这些外来人只能是骗子、阴谋家、假神仙！</p> 
<p>群众自然而然地产生了这些想法，因此，他们的情绪突然变了。</p> 
<p>乔抑制不住地哈哈大笑。卡泽赫的居民眼看着煮熟的鸭子要飞走了，禁不住发出长长的吼叫声。刹那间，弓箭、火枪都对准了气球。</p> 
<p>但这时，一位巫师摆摆手，众人放下了武器。只见巫师爬上树来，他满心想抓住锚索，把这玩意儿拉到地面上。</p> 
<p>乔拿着一把小斧子就往前冲。</p> 
<p>“要砍断吗？”他问。</p> 
<p>“等等。”博士回答。</p> 
<p>“可是，这些黑人……。”</p> 
<p>“我们或许能保住这只锚，我挺珍惜它的，再说眼下还不到非砍断锚索不可的时候。”</p> 
<p>巫师爬到树上后，一味往下拉气球，以至于把树枝弄断了一些。谁知，这竟把锚给解开了。摆脱了羁绊的气球猛地往上升去，锚和被锚挂住双腿的巫师随着气球一同被带了起来。他骑马似地骑着这个意料不到的怪兽离开大树，向空中飞去。</p> 
<p>眼睁睁地看着他们的一位“瓦岗加”冲向空中，下面的人全都惊呆了。</p> 
<p>“万岁！”乔高兴地大叫。此时，“维多利亚号”借助于它的升力正急速地往上升。</p> 
<p>“他很老实，”肯尼迪说，“一次小小的旅行不会伤害他的。”</p> 
<p>“我们要不要把这个黑人一下子给甩掉？”乔问。</p> 
<p>“唔，不能这么做！”博士反驳道，“我们等会儿把他安安稳稳地放到地上去。我相信，经历了这么一次奇遇，在同辈人心目中，他这位巫师的威望会更高。”</p> 
<p>“他们很可能把他奉为神了。”乔喊道。</p> 
<p>“维多利亚号”已经升到1000尺左右的高度。这位可怜的黑人用尽全身的气力死死抓住锚索。他一声不吭，两眼发直，看上去既恐怖又惊讶。一阵微微的西风把气球送出了卡泽赫城。</p> 
<p>半个小时后，博士看到下面的地区荒凉，就拧小氢氧喷嘴的火头，使气球向地面靠去。距离地面还有20尺时，黑人迅速拿定主意。只见他纵身向下一跳，双脚刚落地就急忙向卡泽赫方向逃去。这时，气球由于突然减轻了载重，又重新上升。</p>
