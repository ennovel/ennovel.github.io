<p>An invariably favorable wind had accelerated the progress of the Resolute toward the place of her destination. The navigation of the Mozambique Channel was especially calm and pleasant. The agreeable character of the trip by sea was regarded as a good omen of the probable issue of the trip through the air. Every one looked forward to the hour of arrival, and sought to give the last touch to the doctor's preparations.</p> 
<p>At length the vessel hove in sight of the town of Zanzibar, upon the island of the same name, and, on the 15th of April, at 11 o'clock in the morning, she anchored in the port.</p> 
<p>The island of Zanzibar belongs to the Imaum of Muscat, an ally of France and England, and is, undoubtedly, his finest settlement. The port is frequented by a great many vessels from the neighboring countries.</p> 
<p>The island is separated from the African coast only by a channel, the greatest width of which is but thirty miles.</p> 
<p>It has a large trade in gums, ivory, and, above all, in "ebony," for Zanzibar is the great slave-market. Thither converges all the booty captured in the battles which the chiefs of the interior are continually fighting. This traffic extends along the whole eastern coast, and as far as the Nile latitudes. Mr. G. Lejean even reports that he has seen it carried on, openly, under the French flag.</p> 
<p>Upon the arrival of the Resolute, the English consul at Zanzibar came on board to offer his services to the doctor, of whose projects the European newspapers had made him aware for a month past. But, up to that moment, he had remained with the numerous phalanx of the incredulous.</p> 
<p>"I doubted," said he, holding out his hand to Dr. Ferguson, "but now I doubt no longer."</p> 
<p>He invited the doctor, Kennedy, and the faithful Joe, of course, to his own dwelling. Through his courtesy, the doctor was enabled to have knowledge of the various letters that he had received from Captain Speke. The captain and his companions had suffered dreadfully from hunger and bad weather before reaching the Ugogo country. They could advance only with extreme difficulty, and did not expect to be able to communicate again for a long time.</p> 
<p>"Those are perils and privations which we shall manage to avoid," said the doctor.</p> 
<p>The baggage of the three travellers was conveyed to the consul's residence. Arrangements were made for disembarking the balloon upon the beach at Zanzibar. There was a convenient spot, near the signal-mast, close by an immense building, that would serve to shelter it from the east winds. This huge tower, resembling a tun standing on one end, beside which the famous Heidelberg tun would have seemed but a very ordinary barrel, served as a fortification, and on its platform were stationed Belootchees, armed with lances. These Belootchees are a kind of brawling, good-for-nothing Janizaries.</p> 
<p>But, when about to land the balloon, the consul was informed that the population of the island would oppose their doing so by force. Nothing is so blind as fanatical passion. The news of the arrival of a Christian, who was to ascend into the air, was received with rage. The negroes, more exasperated than the Arabs, saw in this project an attack upon their religion. They took it into their heads that some mischief was meant to the sun and the moon. Now, these two luminaries are objects of veneration to the African tribes, and they determined to oppose so sacrilegious an enterprise.</p> 
<p>The consul, informed of their intentions, conferred with Dr. Ferguson and Captain Bennet on the subject. The latter was unwilling to yield to threats, but his friend dissuaded him from any idea of violent retaliation.</p> 
<p>"We shall certainly come out winners," he said. "Even the imaum's soldiers will lend us a hand, if we need it. But, my dear captain, an accident may happen in a moment, and it would require but one unlucky blow to do the balloon an irreparable injury, so that the trip would be totally defeated; therefore we must act with the greatest caution."</p> 
<p>"But what are we to do? If we land on the coast of Africa, we shall encounter the same difficulties. What are we to do?"</p> 
<p>"Nothing is more simple," replied the consul. "You observe those small islands outside of the port; land your balloon on one of them; surround it with a guard of sailors, and you will have no risk to run."</p> 
<p>"Just the thing!" said the doctor, "and we shall be entirely at our ease in completing our preparations."</p> 
<p>The captain yielded to these suggestions, and the Resolute was headed for the island of Koumbeni. During the morning of the 16th April, the balloon was placed in safety in the middle of a clearing in the great woods, with which the soil is studded.</p> 
<p>Two masts, eighty feet in height, were raised at the same distance from each other. Blocks and tackle, placed at their extremities, afforded the means of elevating the balloon, by the aid of a transverse rope. It was then entirely uninflated. The interior balloon was fastened to the exterior one, in such manner as to be lifted up in the same way. To the lower end of each balloon were fixed the pipes that served to introduce the hydrogen gas.</p> 
<p>The whole day, on the 17th, was spent in arranging the apparatus destined to produce the gas; it consisted of some thirty casks, in which the decomposition of water was effected by means of iron-filings and sulphuric acid placed together in a large quantity of the first-named fluid. The hydrogen passed into a huge central cask, after having been washed on the way, and thence into each balloon by the conduit-pipes. In this manner each of them received a certain accurately-ascertained quantity of gas. For this purpose, there had to be employed eighteen hundred and sixty-six pounds of sulphuric acid, sixteen thousand and fifty pounds of iron, and nine thousand one hundred and sixty-six gallons of water. This operation commenced on the following night, about three A.M., and lasted nearly eight hours. The next day, the balloon, covered with its network, undulated gracefully above its car, which was held to the ground by numerous sacks of earth. The inflating apparatus was put together with extreme care, and the pipes issuing from the balloon were securely fitted to the cylindrical case.</p> 
<p>The anchors, the cordage, the instruments, the travelling-wraps, the awning, the provisions, and the arms, were put in the place assigned to them in the car. The supply of water was procured at Zanzibar. The two hundred pounds of ballast were distributed in fifty bags placed at the bottom of the car, but within arm's-reach.</p> 
<p>These preparations were concluded about five o'clock in the evening, while sentinels kept close watch around the island, and the boats of the Resolute patrolled the channel.</p> 
<p>The blacks continued to show their displeasure by grimaces and contortions. Their obi-men, or wizards, went up and down among the angry throngs, pouring fuel on the flame of their fanaticism; and some of the excited wretches, more furious and daring than the rest, attempted to get to the island by swimming, but they were easily driven off.</p> 
<p>Thereupon the sorceries and incantations commenced; the "rain-makers," who pretend to have control over the clouds, invoked the storms and the "stone-showers," as the blacks call hail, to their aid. To compel them to do so, they plucked leaves of all the different trees that grow in that country, and boiled them over a slow fire, while, at the same time, a sheep was killed by thrusting a long needle into its heart. But, in spite of all their ceremonies, the sky remained clear and beautiful, and they profited nothing by their slaughtered sheep and their ugly grimaces.</p> 
<p>The blacks then abandoned themselves to the most furious orgies, and got fearfully drunk on "tembo," a kind of ardent spirits drawn from the cocoa-nut tree, and an extremely heady sort of beer called "togwa." Their chants, which were destitute of all melody, but were sung in excellent time, continued until far into the night.</p> 
<p>About six o'clock in the evening, the captain assembled the travellers and the officers of the ship at a farewell repast in his cabin. Kennedy, whom nobody ventured to question now, sat with his eyes riveted on Dr. Ferguson, murmuring indistinguishable words. In other respects, the dinner was a gloomy one. The approach of the final moment filled everybody with the most serious reflections. What had fate in store for these daring adventurers? Should they ever again find themselves in the midst of their friends, or seated at the domestic hearth? Were their travelling apparatus to fail, what would become of them, among those ferocious savage tribes, in regions that had never been explored, and in the midst of boundless deserts?</p> 
<p>Such thoughts as these, which had been dim and vague until then, or but slightly regarded when they came up, returned upon their excited fancies with intense force at this parting moment. Dr. Ferguson, still cold and impassible, talked of this, that, and the other; but he strove in vain to overcome this infectious gloominess. He utterly failed.</p> 
<p>As some demonstration against the personal safety of the doctor and his companions was feared, all three slept that night on board the Resolute. At six o'clock in the morning they left their cabin, and landed on the island of Koumbeni.</p> 
<p>The balloon was swaying gently to and fro in the morning breeze; the sand-bags that had held it down were now replaced by some twenty strong-armed sailors, and Captain Bennet and his officers were present to witness the solemn departure of their friends.</p> 
<p>At this moment Kennedy went right up to the doctor, grasped his hand, and said:</p> 
<p>"Samuel, have you absolutely determined to go?"</p> 
<p>"Solemnly determined, my dear Dick."</p> 
<p>"I have done every thing that I could to prevent this expedition, have I not?"</p> 
<p>"Every thing!"</p> 
<p>"Well, then, my conscience is clear on that score, and I will go with you."</p> 
<p>"I was sure you would!" said the doctor, betraying in his features swift traces of emotion.</p> 
<p>At last the moment of final leave-taking arrived. The captain and his officers embraced their dauntless friends with great feeling, not excepting even Joe, who, worthy fellow, was as proud and happy as a prince. Every one in the party insisted upon having a final shake of the doctor's hand.</p> 
<p>At nine o'clock the three travellers got into their car. The doctor lit the combustible in his cylinder and turned the flame so as to produce a rapid heat, and the balloon, which had rested on the ground in perfect equipoise, began to rise in a few minutes, so that the seamen had to slacken the ropes they held it by. The car then rose about twenty feet above their heads.</p> 
<p>"My friends!" exclaimed the doctor, standing up between his two companions, and taking off his hat, "let us give our aerial ship a name that will bring her good luck! let us christen her Victoria!"</p> 
<p>This speech was answered with stentorian cheers of "Huzza for the Queen! Huzza for Old England!"</p> 
<p>At this moment the ascensional force of the balloon increased prodigiously, and Ferguson, Kennedy, and Joe, waved a last good-by to their friends.</p> 
<p>"Let go all!" shouted the doctor, and at the word the Victoria shot rapidly up into the sky, while the four carronades on board the Resolute thundered forth a parting salute in her honor.</p> 
<p>到达桑给巴尔——英国领事——当地居民的敌对情绪——孔伯尼岛——“唤雨”——气球充气——4月18日的启程——最后告别——“维多利亚”号</p> 
<p>一路上时不时吹起的和风护送着“决心号”运输舰飞快地驶向目的地。舰只航行在莫桑比克海峡时更是风平浪静。一帆风顺的航海使人对航空的成功也充满了希望。每个人都渴望快点到达桑给巴尔岛，想着为弗格森博士的准备工作尽最后一把力。</p> 
<p>终于， 从舰上可以望见座落在桑给巴尔岛上的这座与岛同名的城市了。4月15日上午11点钟，“决心号”运输舰在码头抛下了锚。</p> 
<p>桑给巴尔岛属马斯喀特①的伊玛目②管辖。他是法国和英国的同盟者，桑给巴尔无疑是他管辖区中最美的殖民地了。港口里，大量来自邻近地区的船只每天进进出出。</p> 
<p>①阿曼的首都。</p> 
<p>②这里指伊斯兰教长。</p> 
<p>小岛与非洲大陆之间只隔一条最宽不超过30英里的海峡。</p> 
<p>岛上存在着大规模的橡胶、象牙交易，尤其是买卖黑人交易。桑给巴尔岛是一个大的奴隶市场。非洲内地各部落的酋长们源源不断地把在每次打仗中各自抓获的俘虏运到这里买卖，故尔，所有这种战利品都汇集到岛上来了。这种非法买卖从整个非洲东海岸一直扩展到尼罗河地区。M·G·勒让在这里就目睹过有人在法国船上公开进行这种交易。</p> 
<p>“决心号”舰一抵达桑给巴尔岛，英国驻桑给巴尔领事就登船拜访了弗格森博士。他表示愿为博士效劳，给博士的旅行提供帮助。早在一个月前，他就从欧洲的报纸上得到了弗格森博士将从这儿动身乘气球飞越非洲大陆的消息。但是，直到博士抵达之前，他总不肯相信确有其事。</p> 
<p>“我过去一直怀疑，”领事把手伸向弗格森·弗格森说，“但现在，我信了。”他邀请博士、肯尼迪·肯尼迪住到他的家中，诚实的乔自然也不例外。</p> 
<p>领事对博士关怀备至，让博士看了他收到的所有斯皮克上尉的来信。斯皮克上尉和他的同伴在到达乌戈戈国前已经饱受饥饿和恶劣天气之苦。他们只能在重重困苦中艰难跋涉，所以，已经顾不上考虑能不能及时递送消息了。</p> 
<p>这些旅行家的行李被送到了领事的家中。大伙计划把气球从船上卸到桑给巴尔的海滩上。信号柱附近有一块非常合适的场地，旁边的一栋高大建筑物正好挡住东面的来风。这栋高大建筑物是一座粗粗的塔楼，样子象一只竖起来的木桶。海德堡的酒桶与它相比简直是小巫见大巫。这座塔楼是作堡垒用的，塔搂平台上，几位手执长矛的俾路支人在放哨。他们是那些整日里游手好闲，说起话来高声大气的驻防兵。</p> 
<p>但是，在往船下卸气球时，领事得到消息说，岛上的居民要用武力来阻止这件事。再没什么比狂热偏见更盲目了。一位想飞上天空的基督徒来到了岛上。这个消息激怒了当地的居民。黑人比阿拉伯人更容易激动，他们认为这个计划中充满了对他们宗教的敌意。他们想象来人是在打太阳和月亮的主意。要知道，这两个星球可是非洲当地居民崇拜的对象，所以，他们决定阻挠这次亵渎神灵的飞行远征。</p> 
<p>领事对当地居民的这种激烈情绪深有了解，连忙与弗格森博士及皮耐特舰长一起商议了此事。舰长固执地不愿在威胁面前退却，但是，他的朋友弗格森博士最终使他理智下来。</p> 
<p>“我们最终肯定要把气球运走的。”博士对他说，“需要时，伊玛目的这些驻防兵们也许会协助我们。但是，亲爱的舰长，意外说发生就发生。万一遭到袭击，足可以给气球造成无法弥补的破坏，那样，旅行也就无法进行了。因此，做事应当万分慎重才好。”</p> 
<p>“您说怎么办呢？即使我们在非洲海岸登陆了，也将碰到同样的难题！那时，怎么办？”</p> 
<p>“再简易不过了。”领事回答道，“你们瞧，码头那边有许多小岛。把气球卸到随便哪个小岛上，周围再派上一些水兵把守，这样，你们什么危险也用不着冒了。”</p> 
<p>“太好了！”博士说，“而且，做准备工作也很方便。”</p> 
<p>舰长赞成这个建议。 “决心号”随后驶近了孔伯尼岛。4月16日上午，气球被安全地安置到树林中间一块长着青草的空地上。</p> 
<p>两根高80尺的木杆在草地上竖了起来。木杆之间的距离同样是80尺。一套滑轮装置被固定在木杆的缘上。这样，滑轮通过一条横在两根木杆之间的缆绳就可以把气球吊起来。这时，气球还没有充气，里层的小气球与外层的大气球连接一起，也微微地吊离地面。</p> 
<p>在每个气球下部的输气管口上固定了两根氢气导管。</p> 
<p>17日的一个白天都是在安装制造氢氧气体的设备中度过的。这套设备由三十只木桶组成。木桶中盛着大量的水，里面加上废铁和硫酸，水的分解就在桶里进行。产生的氢气在转化过程中经过去除杂质进入中央的一只大木桶。然后从那里通过导管进到每只气球中。用这种方法，每只气球里都装上了一定量的确凿无疑的氢气。</p> 
<p>这次操作，一共需要使用1866加仑硫酸，16050斤铁和966加仑水。</p> 
<p>工作在随后的晚上开始进行， 一直到第二天早上3点钟左右才结束。整个操作持续了几乎8个小时。 第二天，被套上网罩的气球已在吊篮的上方气势雄伟地晃动着了。气球被大量沙袋固定住，使气体产生膨胀的设备被小心翼翼地安装好，从气球里伸出的管子与圆柱形箱子也装配在了一起。</p> 
<p>锚、绳索、仪器、铺盖、帐篷、食物、武器，所有旅行必需物品都放在吊篮里指定的位置。 储备水在桑给巴尔岛时就已经准备妥当。200斤压载物分装成50小袋放在了吊篮底部，不过随手就可以取到。</p> 
<p>这些准备工作到晚上将近5点钟才全部结束。 整个过程中，哨兵们围着小岛不停地巡视，“决心号”运输舰的小划子也在海峡里来回游戈。</p> 
<p>黑人们依然喊叫着，又是龇牙咧嘴，又是扭动身躯以表示他们的愤怒之情。巫师们在激忿的人群中蹦来跳去，拼命煽情，更使他们暴躁不安。几位愤怒不已的狂热分子甚至试图游上小岛，但是哨兵们轻而易举地就把他们赶了回去。</p> 
<p>于是，巫师们开始施展起巫术，念动起咒语。“唤雨”大师们自称能指挥动云彩，他们要呼唤飓风“石雨”①来救助他们。为此，他们把该国各种各样的树叶采集来一些，用小火煮沸。同时，他们还把一根长长的针扎入一头绵羊的心脏，杀死绵羊。但是，不管他们搞什么仪式，天空依然晴朗无云。他们无论刺杀绵羊，还是龇牙咧嘴扮鬼相，全都徒劳无益。</p> 
<p>①黑人称冰雹为石雨。</p> 
<p>极度失望之际，黑人们只好恣意地狂饮乱喝起来。他们忘记一切地猛喝“坦波”酒——一种从椰子树中提取的烈性饮料，和“托格瓦”——一种极其醉人的啤酒。他们唱个不停，一直折腾到深夜方才罢休。他们的歌声虽无优美的旋律可言，却极其富有节奏。</p> 
<p>晚上6点钟左右。 三位旅行家与舰长及军官们聚集在“决心号”的餐厅里共进最后一顿晚餐。已没有人再向肯尼迪提问。他嘟嘟囔囔地低语着一些谁也听不清的话，眼睛紧紧地盯着弗格森博士。</p> 
<p>可以说，这顿饭气氛很沉闷。离别的最后时刻就要来临，这使得众人十分伤感。这三位勇敢的旅行家会有什么样的命运呢？他们有一天能与朋友们重聚吗？他们能重新坐在家里的壁炉旁吗？假如他们的气球不巧坏了，假如他们成了野蛮部落的俘虏，落入那些不曾勘察过的地区，或落入一望无垠的沙漠里，他们会有什么样的结果呢？</p> 
<p>这些想法以前还只是零零散散地在人们头脑中闪现过，并没引起多大注意，现在，却大大激发起人们的丰富想象。向来沉着冷静的弗格森博士东拉西扯，没话找话说，想尽力消除笼罩在大家心头的忧郁之情。然而，他白费了口舌，一切努力都是徒劳的。</p> 
<p>因为担心黑人对他们三人搞什么敌对活动，弗格森博士和他的两个伙伴都睡在了“决心号”运输舰上。清晨6点钟，他们离开舱房，前往孔伯尼小岛。</p> 
<p>气球在东风的吹拂下微微摇晃着。拉住气球的沙袋已被20名水手代替。皮耐特舰长和他的军官们参加了这次庄严的启程仪式。</p> 
<p>这时，肯尼迪径直走向博士，拉住他的手说：</p> 
<p>“塞缪尔，你真的决定走了吗？”</p> 
<p>“亲爱的肯尼迪，这是早已决定的了。”</p> 
<p>“为了阻止这次旅行，我能做的都做到了吗？”</p> 
<p>“都做到了。”</p> 
<p>“好吧，这样我就心安理得了。现在我陪你走。”</p> 
<p>“我断定你会这么做的。”博士答道，脸上立即流露出了激动的表情。</p> 
<p>告别的最后时刻到了。舰长和他的军官们热烈地拥抱了他们无畏的朋友，当然也没放过诚实、自豪和兴高采烈的乔。每位在场的人都想握一握弗格森博士的手。</p> 
<p>9点钟， 三位伙伴登上吊篮。博士点燃了氢氧喷头，并把火头拧大，以便尽快产生热量。几分钟后，原本与地面保持十分平衡的气球开始上升。水手们不得不一点点放开手中拉住气球的绳子。气球上升了20尺。</p> 
<p>“朋友们，”博士站在两位伙伴之间，摘下帽子呼喊道，“给我们的空中航船起一个能带来好运的名字吧！就把它叫作‘维多利亚’号！”</p> 
<p>一片震天的欢呼声随即响起：</p> 
<p>“女王万岁！大不列颠万岁！”</p> 
<p>此时，气球的升力不可思议地越来越大，弗格森·肯尼迪和乔向朋友们作了最后一次道别。</p> 
<p>“全松开吧！”博士喊道。</p> 
<p>于是，“维多利亚”号迅速升入空中。这时，“决心号”运输舰上的四门大炮正鸣炮致意。</p>
