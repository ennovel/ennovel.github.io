<p>The night was calm. However, on Saturday morning, Kennedy, as he awoke, complained of lassitude and feverish chills. The weather was changing. The sky, covered with clouds, seemed to be laying in supplies for a fresh deluge. A gloomy region is that Zungomoro country, where it rains continually, excepting, perhaps, for a couple of weeks in the month of January.</p> 
<p>A violent shower was not long in drenching our travellers. Below them, the roads, intersected by "nullahs," a sort of instantaneous torrent, were soon rendered impracticable, entangled as they were, besides, with thorny thickets and gigantic lianas, or creeping vines. The sulphuretted hydrogen emanations, which Captain Burton mentions, could be distinctly smelt.</p> 
<p>"According to his statement, and I think he's right," said the doctor, "one could readily believe that there is a corpse hidden behind every thicket."</p> 
<p>"An ugly country this!" sighed Joe; "and it seems to me that Mr. Kennedy is none the better for having passed the night in it."</p> 
<p>"To tell the truth, I have quite a high fever," said the sportsman.</p> 
<p>"There's nothing remarkable about that, my dear Dick, for we are in one of the most unhealthy regions in Africa; but we shall not remain here long; so let's be off."</p> 
<p>Thanks to a skilful manoeuvre achieved by Joe, the anchor was disengaged, and Joe reascended to the car by means of the ladder. The doctor vigorously dilated the gas, and the Victoria resumed her flight, driven along by a spanking breeze.</p> 
<p>Only a few scattered huts could be seen through the pestilential mists; but the appearance of the country soon changed, for it often happens in Africa that some of the unhealthiest districts lie close beside others that are perfectly salubrious.</p> 
<p>Kennedy was visibly suffering, and the fever was mastering his vigorous constitution.</p> 
<p>"It won't do to fall ill, though," he grumbled; and so saying, he wrapped himself in a blanket, and lay down under the awning.</p> 
<p>"A little patience, Dick, and you'll soon get over this," said the doctor.</p> 
<p>"Get over it! Egad, Samuel, if you've any drug in your travelling-chest that will set me on my feet again, bring it without delay. I'll swallow it with my eyes shut!"</p> 
<p>"Oh, I can do better than that, friend Dick; for I can give you a febrifuge that won't cost any thing."</p> 
<p>"And how will you do that?"</p> 
<p>"Very easily. I am simply going to take you up above these clouds that are now deluging us, and remove you from this pestilential atmosphere. I ask for only ten minutes, in order to dilate the hydrogen."</p> 
<p>The ten minutes had scarcely elapsed ere the travellers were beyond the rainy belt of country.</p> 
<p>"Wait a little, now, Dick, and you'll begin to feel the effect of pure air and sunshine."</p> 
<p>"There's a cure for you!" said Joe; "why, it's wonderful!"</p> 
<p>"No, it's merely natural."</p> 
<p>"Oh! natural; yes, no doubt of that!"</p> 
<p>"I bring Dick into good air, as the doctors do, every day, in Europe, or, as I would send a patient at Martinique to the Pitons, a lofty mountain on that island, to get clear of the yellow fever."</p> 
<p>"Ah! by Jove, this balloon is a paradise!" exclaimed Kennedy, feeling much better already.</p> 
<p>"It leads to it, anyhow!" replied Joe, quite gravely.</p> 
<p>It was a curious spectacle--that mass of clouds piled up, at the moment, away below them! The vapors rolled over each other, and mingled together in confused masses of superb brilliance, as they reflected the rays of the sun. The Victoria had attained an altitude of four thousand feet, and the thermometer indicated a certain diminution of temperature. The land below could no longer be seen. Fifty miles away to the westward, Mount Rubeho raised its sparkling crest, marking the limit of the Ugogo country in east longitude thirty-six degrees twenty minutes. The wind was blowing at the rate of twenty miles an hour, but the aeronauts felt nothing of this increased speed. They observed no jar, and had scarcely any sense of motion at all.</p> 
<p>Three hours later, the doctor's prediction was fully verified. Kennedy no longer felt a single shiver of the fever, but partook of some breakfast with an excellent appetite.</p> 
<p>That beats sulphate of quinine!" said the energetic Scot, with hearty emphasis and much satisfaction.</p> 
<p>"Positively," said Joe, "this is where I'll have to retire to when I get old!"</p> 
<p>About ten o'clock in the morning the atmosphere cleared up, the clouds parted, and the country beneath could again be seen, the Victoria meanwhile rapidly descending. Dr. Ferguson was in search of a current that would carry him more to the northeast, and he found it about six hundred feet from the ground. The country was becoming more broken, and even mountainous. The Zungomoro district was fading out of sight in the east with the last cocoa-nut-trees of that latitude.</p> 
<p>Ere long, the crests of a mountain-range assumed a more decided prominence. A few peaks rose here and there, and it became necessary to keep a sharp lookout for the pointed cones that seemed to spring up every moment.</p> 
<p>"We're right among the breakers!" said Kennedy.</p> 
<p>"Keep cool, Dick. We shan't touch them," was the doctor's quiet answer.</p> 
<p>"It's a jolly way to travel, anyhow!" said Joe, with his usual flow of spirits.</p> 
<p>In fact, the doctor managed his balloon with wondrous dexterity.</p> 
<p>"Now, if we had been compelled to go afoot over that drenched soil," said he, "we should still be dragging along in a pestilential mire. Since our departure from Zanzibar, half our beasts of burden would have died with fatigue. We should be looking like ghosts ourselves, and despair would be seizing on our hearts. We should be in continual squabbles with our guides and porters, and completely exposed to their unbridled brutality. During the daytime, a damp, penetrating, unendurable humidity! At night, a cold frequently intolerable, and the stings of a kind of fly whose bite pierces the thickest cloth, and drives the victim crazy! All this, too, without saying any thing about wild beasts and ferocious native tribes!"</p> 
<p>"I move that we don't try it!" said Joe, in his droll way.</p> 
<p>"I exaggerate nothing," continued Ferguson, "for, upon reading the narratives of such travellers as have had the hardihood to venture into these regions, your eyes would fill with tears."</p> 
<p>About eleven o'clock they were passing over the basin of Imenge, and the tribes scattered over the adjacent hills were impotently menacing the Victoria with their weapons. Finally, she sped along as far as the last undulations of the country which precede Rubeho. These form the last and loftiest chain of the mountains of Usagara.</p> 
<p>The aeronauts took careful and complete note of the orographic conformation of the country. The three ramifications mentioned, of which the Duthumi forms the first link, are separated by immense longitudinal plains. These elevated summits consist of rounded cones, between which the soil is bestrewn with erratic blocks of stone and gravelly bowlders. The most abrupt declivity of these mountains confronts the Zanzibar coast, but the western slopes are merely inclined planes. The depressions in the soil are covered with a black, rich loam, on which there is a vigorous vegetation. Various water-courses filter through, toward the east, and work their way onward to flow into the Kingani, in the midst of gigantic clumps of sycamore, tamarind, calabash, and palmyra trees.</p> 
<p>"Attention!" said Dr. Ferguson. "We are approaching Rubeho, the name of which signifies, in the language of the country, the 'Passage of the Winds,' and we would do well to double its jagged pinnacles at a certain height. If my chart be exact, we are going to ascend to an elevation of five thousand feet."</p> 
<p>"Shall we often have occasion to reach those far upper belts of the atmosphere?"</p> 
<p>"Very seldom: the height of the African mountains appears to be quite moderate compared with that of the European and Asiatic ranges; but, in any case, our good Victoria will find no difficulty in passing over them."</p> 
<p>In a very little while, the gas expanded under the action of the heat, and the balloon took a very decided ascensional movement. Besides, the dilation of the hydrogen involved no danger, and only three-fourths of the vast capacity of the balloon was filled when the barometer, by a depression of eight inches, announced an elevation of six thousand feet.</p> 
<p>"Shall we go this high very long?" asked Joe.</p> 
<p>"The atmosphere of the earth has a height of six thousand fathoms," said the doctor; "and, with a very large balloon, one might go far. That is what Messrs. Brioschi and Gay-Lussac did; but then the blood burst from their mouths and ears. Respirable air was wanting. Some years ago, two fearless Frenchmen, Messrs. Barral and Bixio, also ventured into the very lofty regions; but their balloon burst--"</p> 
<p>"And they fell?" asked Kennedy, abruptly.</p> 
<p>"Certainly they did; but as learned men should always fall--namely, without hurting themselves."</p> 
<p>"Well, gentlemen," said Joe, "you may try their fall over again, if you like; but, as for me, who am but a dolt, I prefer keeping at the medium height--neither too far up, nor too low down. It won't do to be too ambitious."</p> 
<p>At the height of six thousand feet, the density of the atmosphere has already greatly diminished; sound is conveyed with difficulty, and the voice is not so easily heard. The view of objects becomes confused; the gaze no longer takes in any but large, quite ill-distinguishable masses; men and animals on the surface become absolutely invisible; the roads and rivers get to look like threads, and the lakes dwindle to ponds.</p> 
<p>The doctor and his friends felt themselves in a very anomalous condition; an atmospheric current of extreme velocity was bearing them away beyond arid mountains, upon whose summits vast fields of snow surprised the gaze; while their convulsed appearance told of Titanic travail in the earliest epoch of the world's existence.</p> 
<p>The sun shone at the zenith, and his rays fell perpendicularly upon those lonely summits. The doctor took an accurate design of these mountains, which form four distinct ridges almost in a straight line, the northernmost being the longest.</p> 
<p>The Victoria soon descended the slope opposite to the Rubeho, skirting an acclivity covered with woods, and dotted with trees of very deep-green foliage. Then came crests and ravines, in a sort of desert which preceded the Ugogo country; and lower down were yellow plains, parched and fissured by the intense heat, and, here and there, bestrewn with saline plants and brambly thickets.</p> 
<p>Some underbrush, which, farther on, became forests, embellished the horizon. The doctor went nearer to the ground; the anchors were thrown out, and one of them soon caught in the boughs of a huge sycamore.</p> 
<p>Joe, slipping nimbly down the tree, carefully attached the anchor, and the doctor left his cylinder at work to a certain degree in order to retain sufficient ascensional force in the balloon to keep it in the air. Meanwhile the wind had suddenly died away.</p> 
<p>"Now," said Ferguson, "take two guns, friend Dick-- one for yourself and one for Joe--and both of you try to bring back some nice cuts of antelope-meat; they will make us a good dinner."</p> 
<p>"Off to the hunt!" exclaimed Kennedy, joyously.</p> 
<p>He climbed briskly out of the car and descended. Joe had swung himself down from branch to branch, and was waiting for him below, stretching his limbs in the mean time.</p> 
<p>"Don't fly away without us, doctor!" shouted Joe.</p> 
<p>"Never fear, my boy!--I am securely lashed. I'll spend the time getting my notes into shape. A good hunt to you! but be careful. Besides, from my post here, I can observe the face of the country, and, at the least suspicious thing I notice, I'll fire a signal-shot, and with that you must rally home."</p> 
<p>"Agreed!" said Kennedy; and off they went.</p> 
<p>天气变化——肯尼迪发烧——博士的药——陆地旅行——依芒热盆地——鲁伯霍山——在6000尺的高度——白天的中途休息</p> 
<p>一夜平安无事。然而，星期六清早，肯尼迪一醒来就抱怨四肢无力。浑身发热烧得直打颤。天气在起变化，空中覆盖了厚厚的乌云，老天爷好像在积蓄能量准备来场滂沱大雨。他们正待在曾戈麦罗，这儿可是个阴暗的地区。雨一年到头下个不停，也许只在一月份里有半个月的晴朗日子。</p> 
<p>倾盆大雨说来就来， 劈头盖脸地扑向3位旅行家。他们下面的那些道路被一股股“努拉斯”——一种短时湍流——冲成许多段，顿时变得寸步难行，况且，路面上到处长满多刺灌木丛和杂乱的藤本植物。空气中散发着伯顿上尉谈到的那种浓重的硫化氢气味。</p> 
<p>“伯顿说的话确实有道理，”博士讲，“每簇荆棘丛的后面都像隐藏着一具尸体似的。”</p> 
<p>“真是个糟透的地方。”乔答道，“我觉得肯尼迪先生的身体似乎不怎么样，无法在此过夜。”</p> 
<p>“的确如此，我烧得很厉害。”猎人承认。</p> 
<p>“这没什么大惊小怪的。亲爱的肯尼迪，我们现在是在非洲最有害于身体健康的一个地区。你放心，我们不会在这儿待很久的，上路吧！”</p> 
<p>多亏了乔身手敏捷，锚立即被从枝杈上取了下来。乔顺着梯子回到吊篮里。博士拧大火头，使气体迅速膨胀。不大一会儿，“维多利亚号”在劲风吹送下又开始了飞行。</p> 
<p>透过这瘴雨蛮烟，隐隐约约看到下面有几座茅屋。地面上的模样不断变化着。在非洲，经常是一个面积不大的对身体有害的地块紧挨着一个对身体非常有利的地区。</p> 
<p>肯尼迪显然很痛苦，高烧在摧残着他强壮的体质。</p> 
<p>“病得真不是时候。”他全身裹着被子，躺在帐篷里，懊丧地说。</p> 
<p>“亲爱的肯尼迪，忍着点。”弗格森博士安慰道，“你很快就会好的。”</p> 
<p>“会好的，这毫无疑问！弗格森，如果你那旅行药箱里有什么能治我这病的药，就快拿点给我服。我闭上眼一口就吞下了。”</p> 
<p>“肯尼迪老友，我有比这更好的东西。我当然会给你一付分文不花的退烧药。”</p> 
<p>“你怎么弄到呢？”</p> 
<p>“这非常简单，我现在就把气球实实在在地升到袭击我们的这些雨云上面去，离这种有害的空气远点。给我10分钟时间，我让氢气膨胀起来。”</p> 
<p>10分钟还没到，旅行家们已经冲到了云雨带上面。</p> 
<p>“肯尼迪，再坚持一会儿，你很快就能感觉到纯洁空气和阳光的作用了。”</p> 
<p>“原来是这么一付药！”乔恍然大悟，“真不可思议！”</p> 
<p>“不对！这很正常的嘛。”</p> 
<p>“噢！既然你说正常，我就不怀疑。”</p> 
<p>“我把肯尼迪送到新鲜空气里，因为，在欧洲每天都这么做。如果是在马提尼克岛①，我会把他送到‘皮顿’山上躲避黄热病。”</p> 
<p>①位于加勒比海东部。</p> 
<p>“啊，居然是这样！看来我们的气球是座天堂喽！”此时，肯尼迪已经舒服了些。</p> 
<p>“不管怎么说，它是在带我们去天堂。”乔一本正经地说。</p> 
<p>此时，吊篮下方乌云团团密布，形成了一个奇特的景观：它们你压着我，我压着你，不停地翻来滚去，在绚丽的光辉下，映着阳光，连连搅和在一起。“维多利亚号”已抵达4000尺的高空。温度计表明气温已有所下降。从气球上，已看不见大地。在西方约50英里处，鲁伯霍山露出洒满阳光的顶峰。它构成了乌戈戈国的边界，位置在东经36度20分。风以每小时20英里的速度吹着，但3位旅行家丝毫没察觉到。他们没有任何颠簸的感觉，甚至没有意识到气球在移动。</p> 
<p>3个小时后， 博士的预言成了事实。肯尼迪不再有任何烧得发抖的感觉，而且吃饭有了胃口。</p> 
<p>“这办法就是不错，比吃奎宁片还管用。”他满意地说。</p> 
<p>“将来，”乔仿佛下定了决心，“我就到这儿来养老。”</p> 
<p>上午10点钟左右，天气开始好转，云渐渐散开，大地又露出了面目。“维多利亚号”不知不觉间又向大地靠拢。弗格森博士极力寻找能把他们带往东北方去的气流。在降到距离地面600尺的高度时，他的愿望实现了。下面的地势变得高低不平，甚至成了多山地区。往东飞，随着越过该纬度的最后几棵椰子树，曾戈麦罗地区消失在了身后。</p> 
<p>不多时，一条条高低不等的山岳屹立在眼前，四处一个个山峰直插云端。弗格森必须时时刻刻万分小心，注意避开那些似乎突然从云中冒出来的锐利尖峰。</p> 
<p>“我们现在身处乱石暗礁中了。”肯尼迪担心地说。</p> 
<p>“放心吧，肯尼迪。我们碰不上它们。”</p> 
<p>“这种旅行方式还是挺逗的嘛！”乔插嘴道。</p> 
<p>的确，博士操纵气球的技术令人赞叹。</p> 
<p>“假如我们在这样泥泞不堪的路面上前进，”他说，“我们都会陷进污泥里，步履艰难，困苦不堪。从桑给巴尔动身走到现在的话，恐怕一半的牲口已经累死，我们的样子也会人不人鬼不鬼的，而且一个个灰心丧气，早就绝望了。我们会不断地与向导、脚夫发生冲突，在他们肆无忌惮的粗暴言行下忍声吞气。白天，那潮湿的热气蒸得你头晕脑胀，难以支撑；夜晚，寒冷常常使你无法忍受。再说，还有蚊蝇的叮咬。它们的尖牙利嘴能刺透最厚的布，而且能把人叮得发疯！光这些就够受的了，更不说什么猛兽和残暴的土人了。”</p> 
<p>“我请求咱们别去尝试步行。”乔爽直地回了一句。</p> 
<p>“我一点也不夸张。”弗格森接着说，“因为，读一读那些曾经敢于到这个地区冒险的旅行家们的记叙，你的眼泪都会流出来的。”</p> 
<p>将近11点时，他们飞过了依芒热盆地。散住在这些山丘上的土人徒劳地用他们的武器威吓“维多利亚号”。气球终于飞临鲁伯霍山前的最后一片丘陵地。这片丘陵构成乌扎加拉山的第三条，也是最高一条支脉。</p> 
<p>几位旅行家全面地了解了该地区山岳形态的构造：这三条支脉中，杜图米是第一条，它们之间被一条纵向宽阔的平原隔离开；这些高高的山由一些圆锥形山峰组成，山峰之间的地面上布满了瓦砾和卵石；山中最陡峭的斜坡与桑给巴尔海岸遥遥相望，西坡不过是微微倾斜的高原；低洼地里覆盖着一层黑油油的沃土，上面的草木生长茁壮；大片大片的是埃及无花果树，罗望子树，葫芦树和棕榈树；树丛里，大大小小的水流辗转向东流淌，最后汇入金加尼河。</p> 
<p>“注意！”弗格森博士提醒道，“我们正接近鲁伯霍山。‘鲁伯霍’在当地土语中，意思是‘风口’。我们最好绕过较高的锐利山脊。如果我的地图没有错，我们要让气球上升5000多尺才行。”</p> 
<p>“我们常常有机会升那么高吗？”</p> 
<p>“很少，非洲的山相对于欧洲和亚洲的山来说似乎不怎么高。但是，不管怎么样，我们的‘维多利亚号’不可能被挡住过不去。”</p> 
<p>很短的时间内，氢气在热能的作用下膨胀起来，气球明显地开始上升。氢气的膨胀丝毫不会带来危险，再说，气球的巨大体积里只盛了四分之三的气体。气压表显示已上升到6000尺的高度，因为，水银柱的刻度下降了将近8寸。</p> 
<p>“我们这样要很长时间吗？”乔问。</p> 
<p>“地球大气层有6000托瓦兹①厚。”博士回答，“用大体积气球可以飞很高。这是布利奥希和盖·吕萨克②曾做过的试验。可是他们飞得太高了，以至于嘴巴和耳朵都往外流血。空气稀薄，呼吸起来就困难。几年前，两位勇敢的法国人，巴拉尔和比克西奥，也冒险升到很高的区域。但是他们的气球撕破了……。”</p> 
<p>①法国旧长度单位，1托瓦兹相当于1，949米。</p> 
<p>②盖—吕萨卡1778—1850，法国化学家，物理学家，研究气体的先驱者。</p> 
<p>“他们掉下来了？”肯尼迪关切地问。</p> 
<p>“当然啦！不过，既然科学家可能掉下来，他们就不会让自己受到丝毫伤害。”</p> 
<p>“那好吧！诸位，”乔说，“你们可以自由自在地让他们掉下去。可是，我不过是个没学问的小人物，我更愿意待在适当的位置，不太高也不太低。我压根就没有那个雄心壮志。”</p> 
<p>在6000尺的高空，空气密度已经明显降低；声音传播困难，说话也听不大清楚；下面的物体变得模模糊糊，只看见一大团一大团的东西，难以确定是什么；人和动物根本看不见了；道路像根鞋带，湖泊成了小水塘。</p> 
<p>博士和他的同伴都感觉自己的状态不大正常。一股强劲的气流带着他们飞过一座座荒山峻岭。山顶覆盖着大片大片的积雪，让人看了眼花。群山间道道纵沟，条条凸脊的模样显示出远古初始水在造山运动中的作用。</p> 
<p>头顶太阳倒悬，烈日直射荒凉的山峰。博士把群山概貌精确地绘制成图。这群山由四条不同的岭构成；四条岭几乎处在一条直线上，其中最北边的那条最长。</p> 
<p>不大一会儿，“维多利亚号”沿着枝繁叶茂，绿树成阴的山腰，在鲁伯霍山背面山坡的上空降下了高度。乌戈戈国前沿是一块荒无人烟的地区。层层峦岭，道道峡谷映入了眼帘。再往下，大片黄黄的平原铺展开来，在灼热的阳光烘烤下，大地龟裂，处处是一簇簇盐性植物和带刺灌木丛。</p> 
<p>一些远望成林，近看稀稀落落的矮树点缀在地平线上。博士把气球贴近了地面。锚扔了下去，其中一只很快挂住一棵硕大的埃及无花果树的枝杈。</p> 
<p>乔顺着锚索飞快地滑到树中，小心翼翼地把锚固定好。博士让氢氧喷头继续喷着火好使气球保持着一定的升力浮在空中。这时，风几乎突然平息了下来。</p> 
<p>“现在，”弗格森说，“肯尼迪老友，拿上两杆枪，你一支，乔一支。该你们俩去试试啦，搞几块嫩羚羊腿肉回来当我们的晚饭。”</p> 
<p>“打猎去啦！”肯尼迪高兴地叫起来。</p> 
<p>他翻过吊篮，立即下到地面。乔早已抓着树枝打秋千似地冲下树，在那儿伸展着胳膊腿等他了。因两位同伴下了吊篮，气球的载重减轻，弗格森博士可以把火完全熄灭了。“我的主人，您可别飞走。”乔喊道。</p> 
<p>“放心吧，小伙子，我会牢牢地看住咱们的气球。我打算把笔记整理一下。祝你们打猎愉快。一路要小心啊。另外，我在这儿注意观察周围的动静，一有可疑情况，我就用马枪放一枪。这是咱们集合的信号。”</p> 
<p>“一言为定。”猎人应道。</p>
