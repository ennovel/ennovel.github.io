<p>About the 10th of February, the preparations were pretty well completed; and the balloons, firmly secured, one within the other, were altogether finished. They had been subjected to a powerful pneumatic pressure in all parts, and the test gave excellent evidence of their solidity and of the care applied in their construction.</p> 
<p>Joe hardly knew what he was about, with delight. He trotted incessantly to and fro between his home in Greek Street, and the Mitchell establishment, always full of business, but always in the highest spirits, giving details of the affair to people who did not even ask him, so proud was he, above all things, of being permitted to accompany his master. I have even a shrewd suspicion that what with showing the balloon, explaining the plans and views of the doctor, giving folks a glimpse of the latter, through a half-opened window, or pointing him out as he passed along the streets, the clever scamp earned a few half-crowns, but we must not find fault with him for that. He had as much right as anybody else to speculate upon the admiration and curiosity of his contemporaries.</p> 
<p>On the 16th of February, the Resolute cast anchor near Greenwich. She was a screw propeller of eight hundred tons, a fast sailer, and the very vessel that had been sent out to the polar regions, to revictual the last expedition of Sir James Ross. Her commander, Captain Bennet, had the name of being a very amiable person, and he took a particular interest in the doctor's expedition, having been one of that gentleman's admirers for a long time. Bennet was rather a man of science than a man of war, which did not, however, prevent his vessel from carrying four carronades, that had never hurt any body, to be sure, but had performed the most pacific duty in the world.</p> 
<p>The hold of the Resolute was so arranged as to find a stowing-place for the balloon. The latter was shipped with the greatest precaution on the 18th of February, and was then carefully deposited at the bottom of the vessel in such a way as to prevent accident. The car and its accessories, the anchors, the cords, the supplies, the water-tanks, which were to be filled on arriving, all were embarked and put away under Ferguson's own eyes.</p> 
<p>Ten tons of sulphuric acid and ten tons of iron filings, were put on board for the future production of the hydrogen gas. The quantity was more than enough, but it was well to be provided against accident. The apparatus to be employed in manufacturing the gas, including some thirty empty casks, was also stowed away in the hold.</p> 
<p>These various preparations were terminated on the 18th of February, in the evening. Two state-rooms, comfortably fitted up, were ready for the reception of Dr. Ferguson and his friend Kennedy. The latter, all the while swearing that he would not go, went on board with a regular arsenal of hunting weapons, among which were two double-barrelled breech-loading fowling-pieces, and a rifle that had withstood every test, of the make of Purdey, Moore &amp; Dickson, at Edinburgh. With such a weapon a marksman would find no difficulty in lodging a bullet in the eye of a chamois at the distance of two thousand paces. Along with these implements, he had two of Colt's six-shooters, for unforeseen emergencies. His powder-case, his cartridge-pouch, his lead, and his bullets, did not exceed a certain weight prescribed by the doctor.</p> 
<p>The three travellers got themselves to rights on board during the working-hours of February 19th. They were received with much distinction by the captain and his officers, the doctor continuing as reserved as ever, and thinking of nothing but his expedition. Dick seemed a good deal moved, but was unwilling to betray it; while Joe was fairly dancing and breaking out in laughable remarks. The worthy fellow soon became the jester and merry-andrew of the boatswain's mess, where a berth had been kept for him.</p> 
<p>On the 20th, a grand farewell dinner was given to Dr. Ferguson and Kennedy by the Royal Geographical Society. Commander Bennet and his officers were present at the entertainment, which was signalized by copious libations and numerous toasts. Healths were drunk, in sufficient abundance to guarantee all the guests a lifetime of centuries. Sir Francis M---- presided, with restrained but dignified feeling.</p> 
<p>To his own supreme confusion, Dick Kennedy came in for a large share in the jovial felicitations of the night. After having drunk to the "intrepid Ferguson, the glory of England," they had to drink to "the no less courageous Kennedy, his daring companion."</p> 
<p>Dick blushed a good deal, and that passed for modesty; whereupon the applause redoubled, and Dick blushed again.</p> 
<p>A message from the Queen arrived while they were at dessert. Her Majesty offered her compliments to the two travellers, and expressed her wishes for their safe and successful journey. This, of course, rendered imperative fresh toasts to "Her most gracious Majesty."</p> 
<p>At midnight, after touching farewells and warm shaking of hands, the guests separated.</p> 
<p>The boats of the Resolute were in waiting at the stairs of Westminster Bridge. The captain leaped in, accompanied by his officers and passengers, and the rapid current of the Thames, aiding the strong arms of the rowers, bore them swiftly to Greenwich. In an hour's time all were asleep on board.</p> 
<p>The next morning, February 21st, at three o'clock, the furnaces began to roar; at five, the anchors were weighed, and the Resolute, powerfully driven by her screw, began to plough the water toward the mouth of the Thames.</p> 
<p>It is needless to say that the topic of conversation with every one on board was Dr. Ferguson's enterprise. Seeing and hearing the doctor soon inspired everybody with such confidence that, in a very short time, there was no one, excepting the incredulous Scotchman, on the steamer who had the least doubt of the perfect feasibility and success of the expedition.</p> 
<p>During the long, unoccupied hours of the voyage, the doctor held regular sittings, with lectures on geographical science, in the officers' mess-room. These young men felt an intense interest in the discoveries made during the last forty years in Africa; and the doctor related to them the explorations of Barth, Burton, Speke, and Grant, and depicted the wonders of this vast, mysterious country, now thrown open on all sides to the investigations of science. On the north, the young Duveyrier was exploring Sahara, and bringing the chiefs of the Touaregs to Paris. Under the inspiration of the French Government, two expeditions were preparing, which, descending from the north, and coming from the west, would cross each other at Timbuctoo. In the south, the indefatigable Livingstone was still advancing toward the equator; and, since March, 1862, he had, in company with Mackenzie, ascended the river Rovoonia. The nineteenth century would, assuredly, not pass, contended the doctor, without Africa having been compelled to surrender the secrets she has kept locked up in her bosom for six thousand years.</p> 
<p>But the interest of Dr. Ferguson's hearers was excited to the highest pitch when he made known to them, in detail, the preparations for his own journey. They took pleasure in verifying his calculations; they discussed them; and the doctor frankly took part in the discussion.</p> 
<p>As a general thing, they were surprised at the limited quantity of provision that he took with him; and one day one of the officers questioned him on that subject.</p> 
<p>"That peculiar point astonishes you, does it?" said Ferguson.</p> 
<p>"It does, indeed."</p> 
<p>"But how long do you think my trip is going to last? Whole months? If so, you are greatly mistaken. Were it to be a long one, we should be lost; we should never get back. But you must know that the distance from Zanzibar to the coast of Senegal is only thirty-five hundred--say four thousand miles. Well, at the rate of two hundred and forty miles every twelve hours, which does not come near the rapidity of our railroad trains, by travelling day and night, it would take only seven days to cross Africa!"</p> 
<p>"But then you could see nothing, make no geographical observations, or reconnoitre the face of the country."</p> 
<p>"Ah!" replied the doctor, "if I am master of my balloon--if I can ascend and descend at will, I shall stop when I please, especially when too violent currents of air threaten to carry me out of my way with them."</p> 
<p>"And you will encounter such," said Captain Bennet. "There are tornadoes that sweep at the rate of more than two hundred and forty miles per hour."</p> 
<p>"You see, then, that with such speed as that, we could cross Africa in twelve hours. One would rise at Zanzibar, and go to bed at St. Louis!"</p> 
<p>"But," rejoined the officer, "could any balloon withstand the wear and tear of such velocity?"</p> 
<p>"It has happened before," replied Ferguson.</p> 
<p>"And the balloon withstood it?"</p> 
<p>"Perfectly well. It was at the time of the coronation of Napoleon, in 1804. The aeronaut, Gernerin, sent up a balloon at Paris, about eleven o'clock in the evening. It bore the following inscription, in letters of gold: 'Paris, 25 Frimaire; year XIII; Coronation of the Emperor Napoleon by his Holiness, Pius VII.' On the next morning, the inhabitants of Rome saw the same balloon soaring above the Vatican, whence it crossed the Campagna, and finally fluttered down into the lake of Bracciano. So you see, gentlemen, that a balloon can resist such velocities."</p> 
<p>"A balloon--that might be; but a man?" insinuated Kennedy.</p> 
<p>"Yes, a man, too!--for the balloon is always motionless with reference to the air that surrounds it. What moves is the mass of the atmosphere itself: for instance, one may light a taper in the car, and the flame will not even waver. An aeronaut in Garnerin's balloon would not have suffered in the least from the speed. But then I have no occasion to attempt such velocity; and if I can anchor to some tree, or some favorable inequality of the ground, at night, I shall not fail to do so. Besides, we take provision for two months with us, after all; and there is nothing to prevent our skilful huntsman here from furnishing game in abundance when we come to alight."</p> 
<p>"Ah! Mr. Kennedy," said a young midshipman, with envious eyes, "what splendid shots you'll have!"</p> 
<p>"Without counting," said another, "that you'll have the glory as well as the sport!"</p> 
<p>"Gentlemen," replied the hunter, stammering with confusion, "I greatly--appreciate--your compliments-- but they--don't--belong to me."</p> 
<p>"You!" exclaimed every body, "don't you intend to go?"</p> 
<p>"I am not going!"</p> 
<p>"You won't accompany Dr. Ferguson?"</p> 
<p>"Not only shall I not accompany him, but I am here so as to be present at the last moment to prevent his going."</p> 
<p>Every eye was now turned to the doctor.</p> 
<p>"Never mind him!" said the latter, calmly. "This is a matter that we can't argue with him. At heart he knows perfectly well that he IS going."</p> 
<p>"By Saint Andrew!" said Kennedy, "I swear--"</p> 
<p>"Swear to nothing, friend Dick; you have been ganged and weighed--you and your powder, your guns, and your bullets; so don't let us say anything more about it."</p> 
<p>And, in fact, from that day until the arrival at Zanzibar, Dick never opened his mouth. He talked neither about that nor about anything else. He kept absolutely silent.</p> 
<p>乔的重要性——“决心号”运输舰的舰长——肯尼迪的军火库——上货——饯行——2月21日启程——博士的学术漫谈——杜韦里埃和利文通斯——空中旅行详解——肯尼迪闭上了嘴</p> 
<p>2月10日左右， 一切准备工作即将就绪。两只套在一起的气球已完全做好。充上气后，它们的各个侧面都经受住了强大的空气压力试验。这使人对它们的牢固性有了深刻印象，证明了制作它们时下的功夫没有白费。</p> 
<p>乔高兴得昏了头。他在希腊街和米切尔工厂之间不断忙忙碌碌地跑来跑去，脸上总是喜气洋洋的。他见人就谈有关旅行探险事宜的详情细节，也不管别人问不问他。他觉得最为骄傲的就是能陪主人一起去。我们甚至相信，带人看气球，给人一点一滴地讲述博士的想法和计划，让人透过半开着的窗子看上一眼博士，或博士路过大街时让人瞅瞅，这些都让机灵鬼乔赚了不止几个半克朗。不过也怪不得他，他完全有权利用当时人们的惊讶与好奇稍稍渔一点儿小利的。</p> 
<p>2月16日，“决心号”运输舰驶入格林威治港抛下了错。这是一艘载重800吨的螺旋桨推进式快船。该船曾负责给上次去两极地区探险的詹姆士·罗斯①爵士供应生活必需品，皮耐特舰长是位和蔼可亲的人。他对博士的旅行特别感兴趣。他早就仰慕弗格森博士。这位皮耐特舰长与其说是军人，倒更不如说像位学者。但这并不妨碍他的舰船装上四门大炮。不过，这四门短炮身粗口径的大炮还从未伤过任何人，仅仅是用来发出世界上最和平的声音的。</p> 
<p>为适合安置气球， “决心号”的底舱经过了改装。2月18日白天，气球被小心翼翼地运来，以最稳妥安全的方式存放到了货舱尽头。吊篮及附属部件，锚、绳子、食物，到达马苏阿港口时必须装满水的水箱，一切物质都在弗格森博士的监督下用绳索紧固停当。</p> 
<p>此外，装到船上的还有制造氢气的十大桶硫酸和十大桶废铁。其实，根本用不了这么多原料。不过，考虑到制造氢气时有可能损失一部分，博士还是让人多预备了些。用于生产氢气的全套设备和30只桶也放到了船舱下面。</p> 
<p>这些烦琐的准备工作在2月18日晚上完成。 船上为弗格森博士和他的朋友肯尼迪准备了两间舒适的舱房。这位怀疑论者一面发誓赌咒不去，一面上了船舷，全套的狩猎用具，两支上等的双筒后膛枪和一只经过爱丁堡市珀迪·穆尔—肯尼迪逊工厂全面检验过的马枪也一起带到了船上。用这么一支马枪，猎人能在两千步以外一枪打中岩羚羊的眼睛，而且百发百中，从未失过手。另外，他随身佩带了两支六响科尔特手枪以备万一。算上数量充足的火药、子弹袋、铅弹和子弹，全部重量加在一起没有超过博士允许他携带的重量。</p> 
<p>这三位旅行者于2月19日白天登船安顿了下来。 他们受到了舰长和全体军官热烈而隆重的欢迎。弗格森博士依然相当冷静，一心想着他的探险；激动的狄克·肯尼迪拼命抑制住自己，不愿让感情流露出来；蹦蹦跳跳的乔语言诙谐，张口就惹人发笑，很快成了船员舱里最会逗乐的人。那里给他安排了一个帆布吊铺。</p> 
<p>20日，皇家地理学会为弗格森博士和肯尼迪举行了一个场面浩大的欢送会。皮耐特舰长和他的军官们也应邀出席。宴会气氛热烈，酒肴丰盛，话语醉人。大家为身体健康频频干杯。举杯次数多得足可使每位宾客相信自己能活到百岁。弗朗西斯·M××爵士主持宴会，他极力克制住自己内心的激动，举止始终十分得体。</p> 
<p>令肯尼迪·肯尼迪感到十分困窘的是，很多次祝酒是冲着他来的。在“为无畏的弗格森，英国的荣誉”干杯后，又为“有勇气的肯尼迪，博士的勇敢伴旅”举杯，肯尼迪的脸变得通红，这被看作是谦虚的表现，大伙儿的掌声反而更响了，肯尼迪的脸也就更红了。</p> 
<p>宴会快结束时，收到了女王的贺信。女王在信中向两位旅行家致意，并预祝考察探险成功。这难免使得大家又为“神圣的女王陛下”干杯。</p> 
<p>午夜时分，在一番动情的告别和热烈握手以后，参加宴会的宾客们纷纷散去，各自回家。</p> 
<p>“决心号”的几条小船正等候在西明斯特桥口，舰长在乘客和他的军官们陪同下坐上小船。泰晤士河急速的水流把他们送往格林威治码头。</p> 
<p>1点钟，舰上的人都进入了梦乡。</p> 
<p>第二天， 2月21日早晨3点钟，运输舰的锅炉发出隆隆的轰鸣声。5点，船锚拉了起来。在螺旋桨的推动下，“决心号”运输舰向泰晤士河河口缓缓驶去。</p> 
<p>不用说，全舰上所有人的谈话都是紧紧围绕着弗格森博士的探险进行的。见到他，简直就相当于听到了他的声音。他使人们不由得对他万分信任，以至于很快，全船上上下下，除了苏格兰人以外，没有第二个人对博士的事业会不会成功产生怀疑。</p> 
<p>在这漫长闲暇的航行过程中，博士在作战会议室里给军官们上了一堂名副其实的地理课。这些年青军官们如醉如痴地倾听博士侃侃而谈四十年来人们在非洲的发现。博士给他们讲述了巴尔特、伯顿、斯皮克、格兰特等人的探险活动，描述了方方面面都成了科学调查对象的那块神秘土地。年青的杜韦里埃①在非洲北部考察了撒哈拉大沙漠，并且把图瓦雷格人的几位首领带到了巴黎。在法国政府的资助下，目前，两支探险队正作准备。它们一支将由北往南而下，一支由东往西而来。最后，两支队伍在廷巴克图会合。在南面，不知疲倦的利文斯通一直在向赤道进发。自从1862年3月起，他正在麦肯西的陪伴下沿罗沃尼亚河而上。最后，弗格森博士预言，六千年来非洲深藏不露的秘密必将于十九世纪大白于天下。</p> 
<p>①1840—1892，法国的撒哈拉沙漠考察家，曾发表《撒哈拉—北部图瓦雷格部落的考察》一书。</p> 
<p>倾听弗格森博士谈话的军官们顿时对非洲探险产生了兴趣，尤其当博士向他们详细介绍了他旅行的准备工作后。他们更是来了劲头。他们想验证一下博士的计算，随即展开了讨论，连博士也坦诚地参与了进来。</p> 
<p>大家普遍对博士随身只携带那么一点有限的食物感到吃惊。一天，一位军官就这一点询问了博士。</p> 
<p>“这让您感到意外了，是吗？”弗格森博士反问道。</p> 
<p>“当然了。”</p> 
<p>“那么，您料想我的旅行要多长时间？整整几个月吗？那可大错特错了。假如旅行时间延长，我们就完了，就到不了目的地。您知道，从桑给巴尔岛到塞内加尔海岸， 路程不超过3500英里，就算4000英里吧。就算气球每12小时飞行240英里，这个速度还没有我们的火车快，那么，如果日夜不停的话，七天时间穿越非洲也足够了。”</p> 
<p>“但是，那样的话，您就什么也看不到了。您既无法测定地理位置，也根本考察不了那个地区。”</p> 
<p>“您别忘了，”博士回答道，“既然我是气球的主人，既然我可以随意升降，只要我喜欢，我随时可以停下来，尤其是当气流过强，有把我裹走的危险的时候。”</p> 
<p>“噢，你会遇到的。”皮耐特舰长插话道，“有些飓风的风速甚至超过每小时240英里呢。”</p> 
<p>“您瞧瞧，”博士顺势说，“要是有这么快的风，12个小时内就能横穿非洲了。这样，早上在桑给巴尔岛起床，晚上就可睡在圣·路易岛。”</p> 
<p>“但是，”一位军官问道，“气球飞得能和风一样快吗？”</p> 
<p>“这事有过。”弗格森回答。</p> 
<p>“真的？气球经得住？”</p> 
<p>“完全经得住。拿破仑1804年举行加冕礼时就有过这种事。那天晚上11点，法国航空家加尔纳里安①在巴黎放了一只气球。上面写着这样几个金色大字‘巴黎，13年霜月②25日， 教皇七世陛下为拿破仑大帝加冕。’第二天早上5点钟，罗马的居民看见这只气球在梵蒂冈上空游荡。气球越过罗马平原，掉到了巴塞罗纳的湖中，因此，先生们，气球是可以经得住这样的速度的。”</p> 
<p>①1769—1823，法国航空家，第一个按正规方式使用降落伞，并从空前高度跳下。</p> 
<p>②法国共和历的3月，即阳历的11月21日到12月20日。</p> 
<p>“气球能经得住，但是人呢？”肯尼迪试探着问。</p> 
<p>“是的，人也是一样的！因为，就气球周围的空气而言，气球是静止的。不是气球在运动，而是空气团自身在运动，所以，你在吊篮里点燃一根蜡烛的话，火苗连晃都不晃。如果一位乘客登上加尔纳里安的气球旅行，他一点也不会觉得在这种速度飞行下有什么难受的。不过，我还不想尝尝在那种速度下飞行的滋味。假如晚上我能勾住一棵树或绊住一块起伏不平的地面，我是不会放过的。况且我还带了二个多月的食物呢。再说，着陆时，没什么能挡得住我们这位精干的猎手给我们提供充足的野味。”</p> 
<p>“哇！肯尼迪先生！这回您在那儿真可大显身手了。”一位海军少尉羡慕地望着苏格兰人说。</p> 
<p>“何止这个，”另一位军官接过话头，“崇高的荣誉会使您更加快活的。”</p> 
<p>“先生们，”猎人答道，“对你们的恭维——我很——感动。我无权接受——。”</p> 
<p>“嗯？为什么？”大家齐声发问。“您不去吗？”</p> 
<p>“是的，我不去。”</p> 
<p>“您不陪弗格森先生一起去了？”</p> 
<p>“我不仅不陪他去，而且我来这儿就是为了最后阻止他的。”</p> 
<p>众人刷地把目光全都转向了博士。</p> 
<p>“别听他的。”博士神情平静地答道。“这事不用和他争。其实，他完全清楚他会去的。”</p> 
<p>“以圣帕特利克的名义起誓！”肯尼迪大呼。“我保证——”</p> 
<p>“你什么也别保证了。肯尼迪老友。你的块头量过了，你的重量称过了，包括你的枪支、子弹、火药都过了磅。所以咱们就别再谈了吧。”</p> 
<p>的确如此，从那天起一直到踏上桑给巴尔岛，肯尼迪只谈其他的，再不开口提此事。</p>
