Without having been in the school of the Abbé Faria, the worthy master of The Young Amelia (the name of the Genoese tartan) knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the Mediterranean, from the Arabic to the Proven?al, and this, while it spared him interpreters, persons always troublesome and frequently indiscreet, gave him great facilities of communication, either with the vessels he met at sea, with the small boats sailing along the coast, or with the people without name, country, or occupation, who are always seen on the quays of seaports, and who live by hidden and mysterious means which we must suppose to be a direct gift of providence, as they have no visible means of support. It is fair to assume that Dantès was on board a smuggler. </p> 
<p>At first the captain had received Dantès on board with a certain degree of distrust. He was very well known to the customs officers of the coast; and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits, he had at first thought that Dantès might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of rights and duties, who perhaps employed this ingenious means of learning some of the secrets of his trade. But the skilful manner in which Dantès had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him; and then, when he saw the light plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the Chateau d'If, and heard the distant report, he was instantly struck with the idea that he had on board his vessel one whose coming and going, like that of kings, was accompanied with salutes of artillery. This made him less uneasy, it must be owned, than if the new-comer had proved to be a customs officer; but this supposition also disappeared like the first, when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit. </p> 
<p>Edmond thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was, without the owner knowing who he was; and however the old sailor and his crew tried to "pump" him, they extracted nothing more from him; he gave accurate descriptions of Naples and Malta, which he knew as well as Marseilles, and held stoutly to his first story. Thus the Genoese, subtle as he was, was duped by Edmond, in whose favor his mild demeanor, his nautical skill, and his admirable dissimulation, pleaded. Moreover, it is possible that the Genoese was one of those shrewd persons who know nothing but what they should know, and believe nothing but what they should believe. </p> 
<p>In this state of mutual understanding, they reached Leghorn. Here Edmond was to undergo another trial; he was to find out whether he could recognize himself, as he had not seen his own face for fourteen years. He had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been, and was now to find out what the man had become. His comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled. As he had twenty times touched at Leghorn, he remembered a barber in St. Ferdinand Street; he went there to have his beard and hair cut. The barber gazed in amazement at this man with the long, thick and black hair and beard, which gave his head the appearance of one of Titian's portraits. At this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and hair so long; now a barber would only be surprised if a man gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them. The Leghorn barber said nothing and went to work. </p> 
<p>When the operation was concluded, and Edmond felt that his chin was completely smooth, and his hair reduced to its usual length, he asked for a hand-glass. He was now, as we have said, three-and-thirty years of age, and his fourteen years' imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his appearance. Dantès had entered the Chateau d'If with the round, open, smiling face of a young and happy man, with whom the early paths of life have been smooth. and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past. This was now all changed. The oval face was lengthened, his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked lines which betoken resolution; his eyebrows were arched beneath a brow furrowed with thought; his eyes were full of melancholy, and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy fires of misanthropy and hatred; his complexion, so long kept from the sun, had now that pale color which produces, when the features are encircled with black hair, the aristocratic beauty of the man of the north; the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his features a refined intellectual expression; and he had also acquired, being naturally of a goodly stature, that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself. </p> 
<p>To the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of a rounded and muscular figure. As to his voice, prayers, sobs, and imprecations had changed it so that at times it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness, and at others rough and almost hoarse. Moreover, from being so long in twilight or darkness, his eyes had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the night, common to the hyena and the wolf. Edmond smiled when he beheld himself: it was impossible that his best friend--if, indeed, he had any friend left--could recognize him; he could not recognize himself. </p> 
<p>The master of The Young Amelia, who was very desirous of retaining amongst his crew a man of Edmond's value, had offered to advance him funds out of his future profits, which Edmond had accepted. His next care on leaving the barber's who had achieved his first metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete sailor's suit--a garb, as we all know, very simple, and consisting of white trousers, a striped shirt, and a cap. It was in this costume, and bringing back to Jacopo the shirt and trousers he had lent him, that Edmond reappeared before the captain of the lugger, who had made him tell his story over and over again before he could believe him, or recognize in the neat and trim sailor the man with thick and matted beard, hair tangled with seaweed, and body soaking in seabrine, whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned. Attracted by his prepossessing appearance, he renewed his offers of an engagement to Dantès; but Dantès, who had his own projects, would not agree for a longer time than three months. </p> 
<p>The Young Amelia had a very active crew, very obedient to their captain, who lost as little time as possible. He had scarcely been a week at Leghorn before the hold of his vessel was filled with printed muslins, contraband cottons, English powder, and tobacco on which the excise had forgotten to put its mark. The master was to get all this out of Leghorn free of duties, and land it on the shores of Corsica, where certain speculators undertook to forward the cargo to France. They sailed; Edmond was again cleaving the azure sea which had been the first horizon of his youth, and which he had so often dreamed of in prison. He left Gorgone on his right and La Pianosa on his left, and went towards the country of Paoli and Napoleon. The next morning going on deck, as he always did at an early hour, the patron found Dantès leaning against the bulwarks gazing with intense earnestness at a pile of granite rocks, which the rising sun tinged with rosy light. It was the Island of Monte Cristo. The Young Amelia left it three-quarters of a league to the larboard, and kept on for Corsica. </p> 
<p>Dantès thought, as they passed so closely to the island whose name was so interesting to him, that he had only to leap into the sea and in half an hour be at the promised land. But then what could he do without instruments to discover his treasure, without arms to defend himself? Besides, what would the sailors say? What would the patron think? He must wait. </p> 
<p>Fortunately, Dantès had learned how to wait; he had waited fourteen years for his liberty, and now he was free he could wait at least six months or a year for wealth. Would he not have accepted liberty without riches if it had been offered to him? Besides, were not those riches chimerical?--offspring of the brain of the poor Abbé Faria, had they not died with him? It is true, the letter of the Cardinal Spada was singularly circumstantial, and Dantès repeated it to himself, from one end to the other, for he had not forgotten a word. </p> 
<p>Evening came, and Edmond saw the island tinged with the shades of twilight, and then disappear in the darkness from all eyes but his own, for he, with vision accustomed to the gloom of a prison, continued to behold it last of all, for he remained alone upon deck. The next morn broke off the coast of Aleria; all day they coasted, and in the evening saw fires lighted on land; the position of these was no doubt a signal for landing, for a ship's lantern was hung up at the mast-head instead of the streamer, and they came to within a gunshot of the shore. Dantès noticed that the captain of The Young Amelia had, as he neared the land, mounted two small culverins, which, without making much noise, can throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so. </p> 
<p>But on this occasion the precaution was superfluous, and everything proceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness. Four shallops came off with very little noise alongside the lugger, which, no doubt, in acknowledgement of the compliment, lowered her own shallop into the sea, and the five boats worked so well that by two o'clock in the morning all the cargo was out of The Young Amelia and on terra firma. The same night, such a man of regularity was the patron of The Young Amelia, the profits were divided, and each man had a hundred Tuscan livres, or about eighty francs. But the voyage was not ended. They turned the bowsprit towards Sardinia, where they intended to take in a cargo, which was to replace what had been discharged. The second operation was as successful as the first, The Young Amelia was in luck. This new cargo was destined for the coast of the Duchy of Lucca, and consisted almost entirely of Havana cigars, sherry, and Malaga wines. </p> 
<p>There they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the duties; the excise was, in truth, the everlasting enemy of the patron of The Young Amelia. A customs officer was laid low, and two sailors wounded; Dantès was one of the latter, a ball having touched him in the left shoulder. Dantès was almost glad of this affray, and almost pleased at being wounded, for they were rude lessons which taught him with what eye he could view danger, and with what endurance he could bear suffering. He had contemplated danger with a smile, and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher, "Pain, thou art not an evil." He had, moreover. looked upon the customs officer wounded to death, and, whether from heat of blood produced by the encounter, or the chill of human sentiment, this sight had made but slight impression upon him. Dantès was on the way he desired to follow, and was moving towards the end he wished to achieve; his heart was in a fair way of petrifying in his bosom. Jacopo, seeing him fall, had believed him killed, and rushing towards him raised him up, and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted comrade. </p> 
<p>This world was not then so good as Doctor Pangloss believed it, neither was it so wicked as Dantès thought it, since this man, who had nothing to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the prize-money, manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall. Fortunately, as we have said, Edmond was only wounded, and with certain herbs gathered at certain seasons, and sold to the smugglers by the old Sardinian women, the wound soon closed. Edmond then resolved to try Jacopo, and offered him in return for his attention a share of his prize-money, but Jacopo refused it indignantly. </p> 
<p>As a result of the sympathetic devotion which Jacopo had from the first bestowed on Edmond, the latter was moved to a certain degree of affection. But this sufficed for Jacopo, who instinctively felt that Edmond had a right to superiority of position--a superiority which Edmond had concealed from all others. And from this time the kindness which Edmond showed him was enough for the brave seaman. </p> 
<p>Then in the long days on board ship, when the vessel, gliding on with security over the azure sea, required no care but the hand of the helmsman, thanks to the favorable winds that swelled her sails, Edmond, with a chart in his hand, became the instructor of Jacopo, as the poor Abbé Faria had been his tutor. He pointed out to him the bearings of the coast, explained to him the variations of the compass, and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our heads which they call heaven, and where God writes in azure with letters of diamonds. And when Jacopo inquired of him, "What is the use of teaching all these things to a poor sailor like me?" Edmond replied, "Who knows? You may one day be the captain of a vessel. Your fellow-countryman, Bonaparte, became emperor." We had forgotten to say that Jacopo was a Corsican. </p> 
<p>Two months and a half elapsed in these trips, and Edmond had become as skilful a coaster as he had been a hardy seaman; he had formed an acquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast, and learned all the Masonic signs by which these half pirates recognize each other. He had passed and re-passed his Island of Monte Cristo twenty times, but not once had he found an opportunity of landing there. He then formed a resolution. As soon as his engagement with the patron of The Young Amelia ended, he would hire a small vessel on his own account--for in his several voyages he had amassed a hundred piastres--and under some pretext land at the Island of Monte Cristo. Then he would be free to make his researches, not perhaps entirely at liberty, for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied him. But in this world we must risk something. Prison had made Edmond prudent, and he was desirous of running no risk whatever. But in vain did he rack his imagination; fertile as it was, he could not devise any plan for reaching the island without companionship. </p> 
<p>Dantès was tossed about on these doubts and wishes, when the patron, who had great confidence in him, and was very desirous of retaining him in his service, took him by the arm one evening and led him to a tavern on the Via del' Oglio, where the leading smugglers of Leghorn used to congregate and discuss affairs connected with their trade. Already Dantès had visited this maritime Bourse two or three times, and seeing all these hardy free-traders, who supplied the whole coast for nearly two hundred leagues in extent, he had asked himself what power might not that man attain who should give the impulse of his will to all these contrary and diverging minds. This time it was a great matter that was under discussion, connected with a vessel laden with Turkey carpets, stuffs of the Levant, and cashmeres. It was necessary to find some neutral ground on which an exchange could be made, and then to try and land these goods on the coast of France. If the venture was successful the profit would be enormous, there would be a gain of fifty or sixty piastres each for the crew. </p>  
<p>唐太斯上船不到一天，就和船上人搞得很熟了。少女阿梅丽号（这艘热那亚独桅船的船名）上这位可敬的船长，虽然没受过法利亚神甫的教导，却几乎懂得地中海沿岸的各种语言，从阿拉伯语到普罗旺斯语，都能一知半解地说上几句，所以他不必雇用翻译，多一个人总是多一个累赘，而且常常多一个泄漏秘密的机会。这种语言上的能力，使他和人交换信息非常方便，不论是和他在海上所遇到的帆船，和那些沿着海岸航行的小舟，或和那些来历不明的人，这种人，没有姓名，没有国籍，没有明白的称呼，在海口的码头上可以看到他们，他们靠着那种秘密的经济来源生活，而由于看不出他们经济的来源，我们只能称他们是靠天过活的。读者可能已猜出来了，唐太斯是在一条走私船上。 </p> 
<p>鉴于上述这种情况，船长把唐太斯收留在船上，是不无怀疑的。他同沿海岸的海关官员都非常熟悉。而这些可敬的先生们和他之间时时都在勾心斗角，所以最初他以为唐太斯或许是税务局派来的一个密探，用这条巧计来刺探他这一行动的秘密。但唐太斯操纵这只小船的熟练程度又使他完全放了心。后来，当他看到伊夫堡的上空升起了一缕象羽毛似的轻烟，他立刻想到，他的船上已接纳了一位象国王那样他们要鸣炮致敬的人物。应该说，这时他多少放心了一些，因为这样的一位新来者总比来个海关官员要强，可是当他看到这位新来的伙计态度十分泰然，后面这一层怀疑也就象前者一样地消失了。 </p> 
<p>所以爱德蒙占了个便宜，他可以知道船长是什么样的人，而船长却不知道他是谁。不论那个老水手和他的船员用什么方法来套他的话，他都能顶得住，不泄露半点真情，只坚持说他最初的那番话，他把那不勒斯和马耳他描绘得绘声绘色，他对这些地方了解得象马赛一样清楚。所以那个热那亚人虽然精明，却被唐太斯用温和的态度和熟练的航海技术蒙骗了过去。当然，也许这位热那亚人也同那些明智的人一样，他们除了自己应该知道的事以外别的都不想去知道，除了愿望相信的事情以外，别的都不相信。 </p> 
<p>而就在这种对互相都有利的状况之下，他们到达了里窝那。在这儿，爱德蒙又要接受一次考验：这就是十四年来他不曾看见过自己是什么模样，他现在还认识自己吗。对于自己年轻时的容貌，他还保存着一个完好的记忆，现在要面对的是成年时的自己究竟变成个什么样子。他的新朋友们相信他所许的愿该兑现了。他以前曾在里窝那停靠过不下二十次。他记得在圣·费狄南街有一家理发店，他就到那儿去刮胡子理头发了。理发师惊异地望着这个长发黑须的人，他看上去就象提香［提香（１４８７—１５７６）意大利画家］名画上的人物。当时并不流行这样的大胡子和这样的长头发，而倘若在今天，假如一个人天赋有这样的美质而竟自动愿意舍弃，一定会使理发师大为惊奇的。那位里窝那理发师不加思索，立刻就干了起来。 </p> 
<p>修理完以后，爱德蒙感到自己的下巴已十分光滑，而头发也与常人一般长短了，他要了一面镜子，从镜子里端祥着自己。我已说过，他现在已经三十三岁了，十四年的牢狱生活已在他的脸上发生了气质上的变化。唐太斯进伊夫堡时，有着幸福年轻人的圆圆的，坦诚的，微笑的脸，他一生中早年所走的路是平坦的，而他以为，未来自然只是过去的继续。但现在这一切都变了。他那椭圆形的脸已拉长了，那张含笑的嘴出在已刻上了显示意志坚强而沉着的线条；那饱满的额头上出现了一条深思的皱纹；他的眼睛里充满了抑郁的神色，从中不时地闪现出愤泄嫉俗的仇和恨的光芒；他的脸色，因长期不和阳光接触，而变成了苍白色，配上他那黑色的头发，现出一种北欧人的那种贵族美；他学到的深奥的知识又使他脸上焕发出一种泰然自若的智慧之光：他的身材本来就很颀长，长年来体内又积蓄力量，所以显得更加身强体壮了。 </p> 
<p>丰满结实而肌肉发达的身材已一变而为消瘦劲健，文质彬彬的仪表。他的嗓音，因祈祷，啜泣和诅咒而发生了很大的变化，时而温柔恳切，听来非常动人，时而粗声气近乎嘶哑。 </p> 
<p>而且，由于长久生活在昏暗的地方，他的眼睛早已变得象鬣狗和狼的眼睛一样，具有能在黑夜里辨别东西的能力。爱德蒙望着镜子里的自己笑了，即使他最好的朋友——假如他的确还有什么朋友留在世上的话——也不可能认出他来了，他自己都认不出自己来了。少女阿梅丽号的船长极希望留下象爱德蒙这样有用的人，他预支了一些将来应得的红利给爱德蒙。理发师刚使爱德蒙初步改变了模样，他就离开理发店来到了一家商店里，买了全套的水手服装，我们都知道，那是非常简单的，不过是条全白色的裤子，一件海魂衫和一顶帽子。爱德蒙穿着这套服装到了船上，把雅格布借给他的衬衫和裤子还给了他，重新站在“少女阿梅丽号”船长的面前。船长叫他把他的身世重新讲了一遍，他已认不出眼前这个整洁文雅的水手就是那个留有大胡子，头发里缠满了海藻，全身浸在海水里，快要淹死的时候赤裸裸地被他手下的人救起来的那个人。 </p> 
<p>看到爱德蒙这样焕然一新的样子，他又重新提议，想长期雇用唐太斯。但唐太斯有自己的打算，只接受了三个月的聘期。 </p> 
<p>少女阿梅丽号现在有一个非常得力的，非常服从他们船长的伙计。船长一向总是惜时如金，他在里窝那停靠了不到一星期，他的船上已装满了印花纱布，禁止出口的棉花，英国火药和专卖局忘记盖上印的烟草。船长要把这些货都免税弄出里窝那，运到科西嘉沿岸在那儿，再由一些投机商人把货物转运到法国去。他们的船启航了，爱德蒙又在浅蓝色的大海上破浪前进了，大海是他的青年时代活动的天地，他在狱中曾常常梦到它。现在戈尔纳在他的右边，皮亚诺扎在他的左边，他正在向巴奥里和拿破仑的故乡前进。第二天早晨，当船长来到甲板上的时候（他老是一早就到甲板上去的），他发现唐太斯正斜靠在船舷上，以一种奇特的目光注视着一座被朝阳染成玫瑰色的花岗石的岩山：那就是基督山小岛。少女阿梅丽号在其左舷离它还不到一里路的地方驶过去了，直奔科西嘉而去。 </p> 
<p>这个小岛的名字和唐太斯是这样的休戚相关，当他们这样近地经过它的时候，他不禁在心里想：他只要一下跳进海里用不了半小时，他就可以登上那块上帝赐与他的土地了。不过，那样的话他没有工具来发掘宝藏，也没有武器来保护它，他该怎么办呢？而且，水手们会怎么说，船长会怎么想呢？他必须等待。幸好，他已学会了如何等待。为了自由他曾等待了十四年，现在为了财富，他当然可以再等上一年半载的。最初要是只给他自由而不给他财富，他不是也同样会接受吗？再说，那些财富该不会只是个幻想吧？是可怜的法利亚神甫脑子有病时想出来的东西，是否已同他一起离开了尘世呢？不过，红衣主教斯帕达的那封信是唯一有关的证据，于是唐太斯把那张纸上的内容又从头到尾的默述了一遍，他一个字也没有忘。 </p> 
<p>黄昏来临了，爱德蒙眼看着那个小岛被宠罩在薄暮之中并渐渐地远去了，终于在船上其它人的眼前消失了，但却没有在他的眼前消失。因为他的眼睛在牢狱中早已炼就了透过黑暗看东西的能力，他仍继续看着它，并最后一个离开了甲板。 </p> 
<p>第二天破晓的时候，他们已到了阿立里亚海外。他们整天沿着海岸航行，到了傍晚时分，岸上燃起了灯火。这火光大概是约定的暗号，一看到这火光，他们就知道可以靠岸了，因为有一盏信号灯不是挂在旗杆上而是挂在桅顶上，于是他们就向岸边靠近，驶到了大炮的射程以内。唐太斯注意到，当他们向岸边靠近的时候，船长架起了两尊旧式的小炮，这两尊炮能把四磅重的炮弹射出千步之外而不会发出很大的声响。 </p> 
<p>但这一次，这种预防是多余的，一切都进行得很顺利。四只小艇轻轻地驶近帆船，帆船无疑懂得这种迎候的意思，也放了自己的小艇下海。五只小艇工作得极其神速，到了早晨两点钟，全部货物使都从少女阿梅丽号上御到了环球号上。少女阿梅凡号的船长是办事有条不紊的人，当天晚上他就分配了红利，每人得到了一百个托斯卡纳里弗，也就是说合我们的钱八十法郎。但这次航行并未结束，他们又调转船头驶向了撒丁岛，预备在那儿把已御空的船再装满。第二次行动也象第一次一样的成功，少女阿梅丽号真是太走运了。这批新货的目的地是卢加沿岸，货物几乎全都是哈瓦那雪茄，白葡萄酒和马拉加葡萄酒。 </p> 
<p>从那儿回来的时候，他们和少女阿梅丽号船长的死对头税警发生了冲突。一名海关官员被打死，两名水手受了伤，唐太斯是其中的一个，一颗子弹擦破了他的左肩。唐太斯简直很高兴受这次惊吓，对自己受伤也感到挺高兴。这是无情的教训，教会他怎样用眼睛去观察危险，以怎样的忍耐去忍受痛苦。他微笑着面对危险，就在受伤的时候，还象希腊哲人那样说道：“痛苦呀，你并不是件坏事！”他还亲眼目睹了那个受伤致死的海关官员，不知是因为战斗使他的血沸腾了呢，还是因为他那人类的情感已经麻木了，总之，他对于这个景象几乎是无动于衷的。唐太斯正踏上他所要走的路，正朝着他的既定目标前进，他的心正在经受着锤炼。雅格布看见他倒下时，以为他被打死了，就向他冲过来，将他扶起来，极力地照料他，尽了一个好伙伴的责任。 </p> 
<p>看来，这个世界虽不象班格罗斯医生［伏尔泰小说《老实人》中的人物］所相信的那样好，但也不象唐太斯所认为的那样坏，例如眼前这个人，除了能从他伙伴的身上得到那份红利以外再也无利可图了，但当他看见他倒下去的时候，却显示出那样的痛苦。幸好，我们已经说过，爱德蒙只是受了点伤，在敷上了撒丁岛老好人卖给走私贩子的一种草药（这些草药是在某些季节采集来的）以后，伤口不久就愈合了。爱德蒙想考验一下贾可布，就从他那份红利中拿出一部分来，以报答他对他的照料之情，但雅格布满脸怒气地拒绝了。 </p> 
<p>这是一种同伴间的赤诚之情，雅格布第一次看到爱德蒙的时候就对他产生了这种情感，而爱德蒙也对雅格布产生了某种友善的情感，雅格布觉得有个知己足够了。他已经本能地觉察到了爱德蒙的卓越，那是一种别人都没有觉察到的卓越；而只要爱德蒙稍微对他表示些友善，那诚实的水手也就心满意足了。 </p> 
<p>于是，当那帆船在蔚蓝色的海面上平稳地航行，当他们感谢顺风鼓满了它的帆，除了舵手以外其他一无所需的时候，爱德蒙就利用船上这段漫长的日子，手拿一张地图，充当起雅格布的教师来，就象可怜的法利亚神甫做他的老师一样。他向他指出海岸线的位置，向他解释罗盘的各种变化，教他读那本打开在我们头顶上，人们称之为天空的这本大书。这本书是上帝用钻石作文字，在苍穹中写成的。当雅格布问他，“你把这一切教给象我这样一个可怜的水手有什么用呢？”爱德蒙回答说，“谁知道呢？你也许有一天会成为船长的。你的同乡波拿巴还做了皇帝呢。”我们忘了提一句，雅格布也是科西嘉人。 </p> 
<p>两个半月的时间就在这种航行中过去了，爱德蒙本来就是一个刻苦耐劳的水手，现在又成了一个熟练的沿海航行者；他结识了沿岸所有的走私贩子，并学会了与这些海盗及走私贩子相互之间的秘密联络暗号。他一次又一次的经过他的基督山小岛，一共经过了二十多次，但始终没能找到一个机会上去。于是他下了一个决心：只要他和少女阿梅丽号船长签订的合同期一满，他就自己花钱租一只小帆船，毕竟他在几次航行中，已积蓄了一百个毕阿士特［埃及、西班牙等国的货币名。］，然后找个借口到基督山小岛上去。那时他就可以完全自由地进行搜寻了，或许不能说完全自由，因为那些陪他来的人无疑会注意他的，但在这个世界上，我们得有点冒险精神才行，监狱生活已使唐太斯变得谨慎小心，他很希望不冒险。他虽然想象力丰富，但在一番苦思冥想以后，仍然是一场空，他想不出任何计划可以不用人陪伴而到他所渴望的小岛上去。有天晚上，当唐太斯正在心神不宁地考虑这些疑虑和希望的时候，那位非常信任他非常希望能留下他的船长走了过来，挽起他的一只胳膊，领他到了一艘泊在奥格里荷的独桅船上。那是里窝那的走私贩子们常去聚会的地方，他们就在这儿谈有关沿海一带的生意。唐太斯到这个地方已来过两三次，并见过了所有这些大胆勇敢散布在将近两千里沿岸范围内的免税贸易者，他曾心想，假如一个能克制一下暂时的意志上的冲动，而去把这些五花八门的关系网结合起来，则还愁何事不成。这次他们谈的是一笔大生意，即要在一艘船上装载土耳其地毯，勒旺绒布和克什米尔毛织品。大家必须先商量出一个中立的地点来做这次交易，然后设法把这些货运到法国沿岸。假如成功了，获利是极大的；每个船员可以分到五六十个毕阿士特。 </p> 
<p>少女阿梅丽号的船长建议把基督山岛作为装货的地点，那是一个荒无人烟，既无士兵，又无税吏，似乎从商人和盗贼的祖师邪神麦考莱［罗马神话中商人盗贼的保护神。］那个时代起，就孤立在海的中央了。商人和盗贼这两个阶层，在我们今天这个时代，虽然二者的界限有些模糊，还是略有区别的，但在古代，二者几乎是同一门类的。 </p> 
<p>提到基督山岛，唐太斯就兴奋得心跳加速，为了掩饰自己的情绪，他站起身来，在那烟雾腾腾，集世界上各种各样的语言为一种混合语的独桅船上兜了一个圈。当他再回到那两个对话者那儿的时候，事情已经决定了，他们决定在基督山岛相会，第二天晚上就出发。他们征求爱德蒙的意见时，他也认为那个岛从各方面来看都极安全，而且那件大事，要想做得好，就必须做得快。所以商定的计划决不再做变更，大家同意：第二天夜里就出发，假如风向和天气允许的话，就设法在第三天傍晚到达那个中立小岛的海面上。 </p>
