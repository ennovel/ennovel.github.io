With the first light Dantès resumed his search. Again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous evening, and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape; but it wore the same wild, barren aspect when seen by the rays of the morning sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of eve. Descending into the grotto, he lifted the stone, filled his pockets with gems, put the box together as well and securely as he could, sprinkled fresh sand over the spot from which it had been taken, and then carefully trod down the earth to give it everywhere a uniform appearance; then, quitting the grotto, he replaced the stone, heaping on it broken masses of rocks and rough fragments of crumbling granite, filling the interstices with earth, into which he deftly inserted rapidly growing plants, such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn, then carefully watering these new plantations, he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps, leaving the approach to the cavern as savage-looking and untrodden as he had found it. This done, he impatiently awaited the return of his companions. To wait at Monte Cristo for the purpose of watching like a dragon over the almost incalculable riches that had thus fallen into his possession satisfied not the cravings of his heart, which yearned to return to dwell among mankind, and to assume the rank, power, and influence which are always accorded to wealth--that first and greatest of all the forces within the grasp of man. </p> 
<p>On the sixth day, the smugglers returned. From a distance Dantès recognized the rig and handling of The Young Amelia, and dragging himself with affected difficulty towards the landing-place, he met his companions with an assurance that, although considerably better than when they quitted him, he still suffered acutely from his late accident. He then inquired how they had fared in their trip. To this question the smugglers replied that, although successful in landing their cargo in safety, they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a guard-ship had just quitted the port of Toulon and was crowding all sail towards them. This obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the enemy, when they could but lament the absence of Dantès, whose superior skill in the management of a vessel would have availed them so materially. In fact, the pursuing vessel had almost overtaken them when, fortunately, night came on, and enabled them to double the Cape of Corsica, and so elude all further pursuit. Upon the whole, however, the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned; while the crew, and particularly Jacopo, expressed great regrets that Dantès had not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits, which amounted to no less a sum than fifty piastres each. </p> 
<p>Edmond preserved the most admirable self-command, not suffering the faintest indication of a smile to escape him at the enumeration of all the benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the island; but as The Young Amelia had merely come to Monte Cristo to fetch him away, he embarked that same evening, and proceeded with the captain to Leghorn. Arrived at Leghorn, he repaired to the house of a Jew, a dealer in precious stones, to whom he disposed of four of his smallest diamonds for five thousand francs each. Dantès half feared that such valuable jewels in the hands of a poor sailor like himself might excite suspicion; but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome questions concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per cent. The following day Dantès presented Jacopo with an entirely new vessel, accompanying the gift by a donation of one hundred piastres, that he might provide himself with a suitable crew and other requisites for his outfit, upon condition that he would go at once to Marseilles for the purpose of inquiring after an old man named Louis Dantès, residing in the Allées de Meillan, and also a young woman called Mercédès, an inhabitant of the Catalan village. Jacopo could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present, which Dantès hastened to account for by saying that he had merely been a sailor from whim and a desire to spite his family, who did not allow him as much money as he liked to spend; but that on his arrival at Leghorn he had come into possession of a large fortune, left him by an uncle, whose sole heir he was. The superior education of Dantès gave an air of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to Jacopo to doubt its accuracy. The term for which Edmond had engaged to serve on board The Young Amelia having expired, Dantès took leave of the captain, who at first tried all his powers of persuasion to induce him to remain as one of the crew, but having been told the history of the legacy, he ceased to importune him further. The following morning Jacopo set sail for Marseilles, with directions from Dantès to join him at the Island of Monte Cristo. </p> 
<p>Having seen Jacopo fairly out of the harbor, Dantès proceeded to make his final adieus on board The Young Amelia, distributing so liberal a gratuity among her crew as to secure for him the good wishes of all, and expressions of cordial interest in all that concerned him. To the captain he promised to write when he had made up his mind as to his future plans. Then Dantès departed for Genoa. At the moment of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay; this yacht had been built by order of an Englishman, who, having heard that the Genoese excelled all other builders along the shores of the Mediterranean in the construction of fast-sailing vessels, was desirous of possessing a specimen of their skill; the price agreed upon between the Englishman and the Genoese builder was forty thousand francs. Dantès, struck with the beauty and capability of the little vessel, applied to its owner to transfer it to him, offering sixty thousand francs, upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate possession. The proposal was too advantageous to be refused, the more so as the person for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through Switzerland, and was not expected back in less than three weeks or a month, by which time the builder reckoned upon being able to complete another. A bargain was therefore struck. Dantès led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a Jew; retired with the latter for a few minutes to a small back parlor, and upon their return the Jew counted out to the shipbuilder the sum of sixty thousand francs in bright gold pieces. </p> 
<p>The delighted builder then offered his services in providing a suitable crew for the little vessel, but this Dantès declined with many thanks, saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone, and his principal pleasure consisted in managing his yacht himself; the only thing the builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a sort of secret closet in the cabin at his bed's head, the closet to contain three divisions, so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself. The builder cheerfully undertook the commission, and promised to have these secret places completed by the next day, Dantès furnishing the dimensions and plan in accordance with which they were to be constructed. </p> 
<p>The following day Dantès sailed with his yacht from Genoa, under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich Spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht. But their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which Dantès handled the helm. The boat, indeed, seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence, so promptly did it obey the slightest touch; and Dantès required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to acknowledge that the Genoese had not without reason attained their high reputation in the art of shipbuilding. The spectators followed the little vessel with their eyes as long as it remained visible; they then turned their conjectures upon her probable destination. Some insisted she was making for Corsica, others the Island of Elba; bets were offered to any amount that she was bound for Spain; while Africa was positively reported by many persons as her intended course; but no one thought of Monte Cristo. Yet thither it was that Dantès guided his vessel, and at Monte Cristo he arrived at the close of the second day; his boat had proved herself a first-class sailer, and had come the distance from Genoa in thirty-five hours. Dantès had carefully noted the general appearance of the shore, and, instead of landing at the usual place, he dropped anchor in the little creek. The island was utterly deserted, and bore no evidence of having been visited since he went away; his treasure was just as he had left it. Early on the following morning he commenced the removal of his riches, and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited in the compartments of the secret locker. </p> 
<p>A week passed by. Dantès employed it in manoeuvring his yacht round the island, studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined for some important service, till at the end of that time he was perfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities. The former Dantès proposed to augment, the latter to remedy. </p> 
<p>Upon the eighth day he discerned a small vessel under full sail approaching Monte Cristo. As it drew near, he recognized it as the boat he had given to Jacopo. He immediately signalled it. His signal was returned, and in two hours afterwards the newcomer lay at anchor beside the yacht. A mournful answer awaited each of Edmond's eager inquiries as to the information Jacopo had obtained. Old Dantès was dead, and Mercédès had disappeared. Dantès listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness; but, leaping lightly ashore, he signified his desire to be quite alone. In a couple of hours he returned. Two of the men from Jacopo's boat came on board the yacht to assist in navigating it, and he gave orders that she should be steered direct to Marseilles. For his father's death he was in some manner prepared; but he knew not how to account for the mysterious disappearance of Mercédès. </p> 
<p>Without divulging his secret, Dantès could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an agent. There were, besides, other particulars he was desirous of ascertaining, and those were of a nature he alone could investigate in a manner satisfactory to himself. His looking-glass had assured him, during his stay at Leghorn, that he ran no risk of recognition; moreover, he had now the means of adopting any disguise he thought proper. One fine morning, then, his yacht, followed by the little fishing-boat, boldly entered the port of Marseilles, and anchored exactly opposite the spot from whence, on the never-to-be-forgotten night of his departure for the Chateau d'If, he had been put on board the boat destined to convey him thither. Still Dantès could not view without a shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the officers deputed to demand his bill of health ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the shore; but with that perfect self-possession he had acquired during his acquaintance with Faria, Dantès coolly presented an English passport he had obtained from Leghorn, and as this gave him a standing which a French passport would not have afforded, he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation. </p> 
<p>The first person to attract the attention of Dantès, as he landed on the Canebière, was one of the crew belonging to the Pharaon. Edmond welcomed the meeting with this fellow--who had been one of his own sailors--as a sure means of testing the extent of the change which time had worked in his own appearance. Going straight towards him, he propounded a variety of questions on different subjects, carefully watching the man's countenance as he did so; but not a word or look implied that he had the slightest idea of ever having seen before the person with whom he was then conversing. Giving the sailor a piece of money in return for his civility, Dantès proceeded onwards; but ere he had gone many steps he heard the man loudly calling him to stop. Dantès instantly turned to meet him. "I beg your pardon, sir," said the honest fellow, in almost breathless haste, "but I believe you made a mistake; you intended to give me a two-franc piece, and see, you gave me a double Napoleon." </p> 
<p>"Thank you, my good friend. I see that I have made a trifling mistake, as you say; but by way of rewarding your honesty I give you another double Napoleon, that you may drink to my health, and be able to ask your messmates to join you." </p> 
<p>So extreme was the surprise of the sailor, that he was unable even to thank Edmond, whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless astonishment. "Some nabob from India," was his comment. </p> 
<p>Dantès, meanwhile, went on his way. Each step he trod oppressed his heart with fresh emotion; his first and most indelible recollections were there; not a tree, not a street, that he passed but seemed filled with dear and cherished memories. And thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the end of the Rue de Noailles, from whence a full view of the Allées de Meillan was obtained. At this spot, so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances, his heart beat almost to bursting, his knees tottered under him, a mist floated over his sight, and had he not clung for support to one of the trees, he would inevitably have fallen to the ground and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there. Recovering himself, however, he wiped the perspiration from his brows, and stopped not again till he found himself at the door of the house in which his father had lived. </p> 
<p>The nasturtiums and other plants, which his father had delighted to train before his window, had all disappeared from the upper part of the house. Leaning against the tree, he gazed thoughtfully for a time at the upper stories of the shabby little house. Then he advanced to the door, and asked whether there were any rooms to be let. Though answered in the negative, he begged so earnestly to be permitted to visit those on the fifth floor, that, in despite of the oft-repeated assurance of the concièrge that they were occupied, Dantès succeeded in inducing the man to go up to the tenants, and ask permission for a gentleman to be allowed to look at them. </p> 
<p>The tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week; and seeing them, Dantès sighed heavily. Nothing in the two small chambers forming the apartments remained as it had been in the time of the elder Dantès; the very paper was different, while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the rooms had been filled in Edmond's time had all disappeared; the four walls alone remained as he had left them. The bed belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the chamber had been accustomed to have his; and, in spite of his efforts to prevent it, the eyes of Edmond were suffused in tears as he reflected that on that spot the old man had breathed his last, vainly calling for his son. The young couple gazed with astonishment at the sight of their visitor's emotion, and wondered to see the large tears silently chasing each other down his otherwise stern and immovable features; but they felt the sacredness of his grief, and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause, while, with instinctive delicacy, they left him to indulge his sorrow alone. When he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections, they both accompanied him downstairs, reiterating their hope that he would come again whenever he pleased, and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to him. As Edmond passed the door on the fourth floor, he paused to inquire whether Caderousse the tailor still dwelt there; but he received, for reply, that the person in question had got into difficulties, and at the present time kept a small inn on the route from Bellegarde to Beaucaire. </p> 
<p>Having obtained the address of the person to whom the house in the Allées de Meillan belonged, Dantès next proceeded thither, and, under the name of Lord Wilmore (the name and title inscribed on his passport), purchased the small dwelling for the sum of twenty-five thousand francs, at least ten thousand more than it was worth; but had its owner asked half a million, it would unhesitatingly have been given. The very same day the occupants of the apartments on the fifth floor of the house, now become the property of Dantès, were duly informed by the notary who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds, etc., that the new landlord gave them their choice of any of the rooms in the house, without the least augmentation of rent, upon condition of their giving instant possession of the two small chambers they at present inhabited. </p>  
<p>唐太斯急不可耐地等待着黎明的到来，当曙光终于照在了基督山岛荒凉的海岸时，唐太斯就爬起来，登上昨天黄昏时他上去过的那块岩石顶上，极目四望，细察一景一物，但岛上依旧昨日那种荒芜的景象，他回到洞口，搬开那块石头，进去在口袋里装满了宝石，把箱子尽可能地埋好，又洒了些新土在上面，小心地用脚在上面踩了踩，使各处看来都一样。然后，走出洞来，把那块石头盖回原处，在上面堆了些破碎的岩石和大块的花岗石碎片，又用泥土填满石缝，移了几棵香桃木和荆棘花种植在这些石缝里，并给这些新移种的植物浇些水，使它们看起来象是很久以来就生长在这儿的一样，然后擦去四周的脚印，焦急地等待他的同伴回来。他并不想整天地去望着那些黄金和钻石，或留在基督山岛上，象一条龙似的守护着那些沉在地下的宝藏。他现在必须回到现实生活中去，回到人们中去，到社会上去重新获得地位，势力和威望，而在这个世界里，只有钱才能使人获得这一切，——钱是支配人类最有效和最伟大的力量。 </p> 
<p>到了第六天，于是他装出一副艰难的样子，把他自己拖到了岸边，当他的同伴来到他眼前的时候，他就说尽管他已觉得好多了，但这次意外给他造成了极大的痛苦。然后他便向他们询问有关这次航行的情况。走私贩子们告诉他，虽然货是安全地卸到了岸上，但刚卸完，他们就得到消息，说是有一艘警戒船已从土伦港开出来，正扯着满帆向他们驶来。这使他们不得不尽可能快地避开他们的敌人，他们一路惋惜唐太斯不在船上，因为他那高超的驾船技巧在那种紧要关头对他们是极有帮助的。事实上，那艘追逐的船差一点追上了他们，幸亏他们当时借助夜色绕过科西嘉海峡，摆脱了追踪。总的说来，这次各方都挺满意的。船员们，尤其是雅格布，对于唐太斯没能和他们同去深表遗憾，不然，他也可以得到一份和他们相等的红利，每人足足得了五十个毕阿士特。 </p> 
<p>爱德蒙仍然不露声色，尽管他能想象到，只要离开这个小岛他就可以得到多大的好处，但他仍不露一丝微笑。毕竟少女阿梅丽号到基督山岛来是专为来接他的，他当晚就上了船，和船长一同继续向里窝那驶进。到了里窝那，他走进了一个做珠宝商的犹太人的店里，拿出了四颗最小的钻石，每颗卖了五千法郎。起初唐太斯还担心这样值钱的珠宝拿在象他这样穷苦的水手手里也许会引起别人怀疑，但那精明的买主对于这笔他至少可以赚到四千法郎的交易并没提出任何疑异。 </p> 
<p>第二天，唐太斯买了一艘全新的帆船送给了雅格布，另外还送了他一笔一百毕阿士特，使他可以雇一批合适的船员和购办其他必要的配备，不过附带了一个条件，就是必须马上到马赛去打听一个名叫路易·唐太斯，住在梅朗巷的老人，和一个住在迦太罗尼亚人村，名叫美塞苔丝的年轻姑娘。 </p> 
<p>这次可轮到雅格布以为自己在做梦了。唐太斯告诉他，他之所以当了一名水手，完全是出于他的怪癖，他和他的朋友们赌了一口气，因为他们不许他称心如意的花钱。这次到了里窝那，他得到了一大笔财产，是他的一位叔父遗赠给他的，他是他叔父唯一的继承人。唐太斯所表现出的优良教养使这番话听来极其可信，所以雅格布丝毫也没怀疑它的真实性。爱德蒙在少女阿梅丽号上的服务合同已到期了，他去和船长告别时，后者最初竭力想挽留住他，但在听说了那遗产的事以后，也就不再强求了。第二天早晨，雅格布扬帆向马赛驶去，唐太斯和他约好在基督山岛相会。 </p> 
<p>目送雅格布出港远去以后，唐太斯就又回到少女阿梅丽号上去作最后的告别，他赠送了许多礼物给船员，船员们一致祝他好运。对于他的一切都表示热切的关注。至于船长，他答应在他决定了未来的计划以后就写信告诉他。这一幕告别结束以后，唐太斯就去了热那亚。当他到达那儿的时候，一艘小游艇正在港湾里试航。这艘小游艇是一个英国人定制的，他因为听说热那亚人是地中海沿岸制造快航帆船的行家里手，所以很希望得以证实一下。于是那英国人和热那亚船商讲定的价钱是四万法郎。唐太斯愿出六万法郎买下它，条件是必须立刻把船交给他。定造这艘游艇的那个人已到瑞士去旅行了，要过三四个星期才能回来，在这期间，船商估计可以另造一艘。 </p> 
<p>所以这笔交易就谈成了。唐太斯把船商带到一个犹太人的家里，和犹太人到一间很狭小的后客厅里单独谈了几分钟，回来的时候，犹太人就数了六万法郎给了造船商。 </p> 
<p>造船商主动提出给那艘小帆船配备一个水手班子，但被唐太斯婉言谢绝了。他说他惯于独自航行，他惟一的希望就是造船商能在他船舱的床头设计安装上一个秘密柜，柜里要有三个暗格。他说了这些暗格的尺寸，第二天就做好了。 </p> 
<p>两小时以后，唐太斯便在众多好奇者的目光下驶出了热那亚港口，那些人都出于好奇，想来看看这位喜欢亲自驾船的，有钱的西班牙贵族。唐太斯驾船应付自如，他不用离开舵，只需轻轻拨一下舵柄，就可使他的游艇按他的意愿行驶。它真象是一个小精灵，只要一点轻微的指示，就会立刻服从。唐太斯把他这艘美丽的船略试一试，便信服了，热那亚人不愧有世界上一流造船好手的美誉。好奇的人们望着这艘小帆船，直到它消失在他们的视野之外，然后他们转过身来，纷纷猜测它可能去的目的地。有些人坚持说它是到科西嘉岛去的，有些人则坚持说是厄尔巴岛。有些人打赌说它一定到西班牙去，而有些人则固执地以为它是到非洲去的。但谁都没有想到基督山岛。 </p> 
<p>可是，唐太斯所去的地方正是基督山岛。他在第二天傍晚就到了那里。这是因为他的游艇的确是一艘一流的帆船，从热那亚到这儿的航行只花了三十五小时。唐太斯仔细地观察了一下岸边的情况，他没在老地方靠岸，却在小湾里抛了锚。小岛上空无一人，自从他上次离开以来，似乎再也没人来过。他的宝藏仍和他离开它的时候一样。第二天一早，他就开始搬运他的财富，在夜幕落下以前，他那笔庞大的财富已全部安全地藏进了他的秘密柜的暗格里。 </p> 
<p>一个星期过去了。唐太斯用这一段时间反复研究他的游艇，象个老练的骑师研究他那将委以重任的骏马一样。终于他完全摸清了游艇的优点和缺点，他准备尽量发挥其优点，弥补其它的缺点。 </p> 
<p>到第八天，他看见有一艘小帆船扯满了帆正向基督山岛驶来。当它驶近些的时候，他认出那正是他送给雅格布的那艘船。他立刻向它发出了一个信号。他的信号得到了答复，两小时后那艘小帆船靠在了游艇旁边。唐太斯急切地提出的问题得到的都是悲哀的答复。老唐太斯死了，美塞苔丝失踪了。唐太斯神态很镇静地听完了这些伤心的消息，但当他上岸去的时候，他示意不愿有人去打扰他。两小时后，他回来了。雅格布的船上调了两个水手到游艇上，协助驶船，于是他下令把船直向马赛驶去。他父亲的死多少是在他意料之中的，但美塞苔丝究竟怎么样了呢？ </p> 
<p>唐太斯因为不想泄漏他的秘密，所以就无法给手下人以明确的指示。而且，他很想了解一些详情，而那样，他只有亲自去调查了，上次他在里窝那照镜子以后便很放心了，知道决不会有被人认出的危险，况且，他现在可以随心所欲地打扮自己。于是，在一个晴朗的早晨，他的游艇，后面跟着那艘小帆船，勇敢地驶进了马赛港，不偏不倚地在那个值得纪念的地点前面抛了锚，那就是他终生难忘的那一夜，当他被兵挟上船，被押解到伊夫堡去的那个码头。当看到一个宪兵驾着一艘检疫船驶来的时候，唐太斯不由地打了一个寒颤。但凭借他和法利亚相处时所获得的那种自持力，他冷静地拿出了他在里窝那买来的英国护照，当时，英国护照在法国比我们本国的护照更受尊重，所以凭借那个外国护照，唐太斯毫无困难的上了岸。 </p> 
<p>当唐太斯走在卡尼般丽街上的时候，第一个引起他注意的是一个法老号上的船员。这个人曾在他手下干过，爱德蒙一看见这个人就大声叫住了他，想借此对自己外表上所起的变化作一番精确的考验。他径直地向他走过去，提出了许多的问题，一边问一边小心地观察那人的面部表情，但不论从言谈上或神色上，都一点也看不出对方似乎认识眼前同他谈话的这个人。唐太斯给了那水手一枚金币，以答谢他提供的情况，然后继续向前走去。但他还没走出几步远，就听到那个人又追上了他。唐太斯转过身去。“对不起，先生，”那个诚实的人几乎上气不接下气地说道，“我想是你弄错了，你本来是想给我一个四十苏的角子，而你却给了我一个双拿破仑［拿破仑时代的一种金币，价值四十法郎］。” </p> 
<p>“谢谢你，我的好朋友。看来我是有点弄错了，但你的这种诚实的精神该受到奖赏，我再给你一个双拿破仑，请你拿去和你的同伴们一起为我的健康干一杯吧。” </p> 
<p>那水手惊诧不已，甚至都没想到谢谢一声爱德蒙，只带着说不出的惊讶凝视着他那逐渐远去的背影。最后，他深深地吸了一口气，再看一看他手中的金币，回到了码头上，自言自语的说：“这是印度来的一个大富翁。” </p> 
<p>唐太斯继续向前走去。他每迈出一步，自己的心上就添上一个新的感触。在他的记忆中，最初和最不可磨灭的，就是这个地方。他所经过的每一棵树，每一条街，都无一不唤起他对那亲切而珍爱的往事的回忆。当他走到诺黎史路的尽头，望见梅朗巷的时候，他感到双膝在发抖，差一点跌倒在一辆马车的车轮下。最后，他终于走到了他父亲从前住过的那座房子前面。 </p> 
<p>那善良的老人所喜欢的牵牛花和其他花木，以前曾盘绕在他的窗前，现在一看那座房子的上面，什么都不见了。唐太斯靠在一棵树上，对那座可怜的小房子凝视了许久，然后他才走到门口，问这座屋子是否有空余房间出租。虽然得到了否定的答复，他还是热切地恳求允许他去看一下六楼上的那些房间，看门人就上去问那两个房间的房客，是否允许一个陌生人来看一下房子。房客是一对刚在一星期以前结婚的青年夫妇，唐太斯看着他们，深深地叹了一口气。 </p> 
<p>这层楼只有这两个小间，房间里已找不到一点儿老唐太斯留下的任何痕迹了连墙纸都与以前不同了。旧时的家具，在他的童年时代是这样的熟悉，一桌一椅都深深地刻在他的记忆里，现在却都不见了，只有四面的墙壁依然如旧。眼前这对居民的床，仍然放在这个房间以前那个房客放床的老地方。爱德蒙虽极力抑制着自己的感情，但当他一想到那个老人曾躺在这个位置徒然地呼唤着他的儿子的名字而断气时，他的眼睛里不由自主地涌满了泪水。那对青年夫妇看到这位面色严肃的人泪流满面，觉得很惊奇，但他们感到他的悲伤里有一种庄严的滋味。就克制住自己，不去问他。他们让他独自发泄他的悲哀。当他退出去的时候，他们一齐陪他下楼，并向他表示，只要他愿意，他随时都可以再来，再三向他保证，他们这小屋是永远欢迎你的。当爱德蒙经过五楼的时候，他在一个房间门口停了下来，询问裁缝卡德鲁斯是否还住在那儿，得到的答复是，那个人境况很困难，目前在比里加答到布揆耳的路上开了一家小客栈。 </p> 
<p>唐太斯问清了梅朗巷这座房子房东的地址，就到了那里，以威玛勋爵的名义（这是他护照上的姓名和头衔）买下了那座小房子，出价是二万五千法郎，至少比它本身的价值超出了一万法郎。但即使房东要十倍于他所讨的数目，那笔钱他也会毫无疑问地拿到的。那所房子现在是唐太斯的产业了，就在当天，六楼的房客得到一份办理转移房契手续的律师的通知，说是新房东让他们随意在这座房子里选择一套房间来住，一点也不加房租，唯一的条件是他们得让出现在所住的那两个小房间。 </p> 
<p>这件怪事成了梅朗巷附近好奇的人们的谈话资料，人们作了种种猜测，但没有一种是猜对的。而使人们最为惊奇的，并使一切推测都落了空的，是这位曾在早晨去访问过梅朗巷的怪客，傍晚时竟有人看到他在迦太罗尼亚人住的小村庄里散步，后来走进了一个穷苦的渔夫的茅舍里，在那里消磨了一个多钟头，他所询问的人，不是已经去世，就是在十五六年前就离开了。第二天，被走访过那户人家收到了一份可观的礼物，包括一艘全新的渔船和各种大大小小的优质渔网。收到这份厚礼的人家自然很欢喜，很高兴能向这位慷慨的赐主表示他们的谢意，但他们看到他离开茅屋以后，只对一个水手吩咐了几句话，便轻轻地跃上马背，顺着埃克斯港离开了马赛。 </p>
