In the ray of light which entered by the narrow window of his cell, he held open in his left hand, of which alone, it will be recollected, he retained the use, a sheet of paper, which, from being constantly rolled into a small compass, had the form of a cylinder, and was not easily kept open. He did not speak, but showed the paper to Dantès. </p> 
<p>"What is that?" he inquired. </p> 
<p>"Look at it," said the abbé with a smile. </p> 
<p>"I have looked at it with all possible attention," said Dantès, "and I only see a half-burnt paper, on which are traces of Gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink." </p> 
<p>"This paper, my friend," said Faria, "I may now avow to you, since I have the proof of your fidelity--this paper is my treasure, of which, from this day forth, one-half belongs to you." </p> 
<p>The sweat started forth on Dantès brow. Until this day and for how long a time!--he had refrained from talking of the treasure, which had brought upon the abbé the accusation of madness. With his instinctive delicacy Edmond had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord, and Faria had been equally silent. He had taken the silence of the old man for a return to reason; and now these few words uttered by Faria, after so painful a crisis, seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental alienation. </p> 
<p>"Your treasure?" stammered Dantès. Faria smiled. </p> 
<p>"Yes," said he. "You have, indeed, a noble nature, Edmond, and I see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your heart at this moment. No, be assured, I am not mad. This treasure exists, Dantès, and if I have not been allowed to possess it, you will. Yes--you. No one would listen or believe me, because everyone thought me mad; but you, who must know that I am not, listen to me, and believe me so afterwards if you will." </p> 
<p>"Alas," murmured Edmond to himself, "this is a terrible relapse! There was only this blow wanting." Then he said aloud, "My dear friend, your attack has, perhaps, fatigued you; had you not better repose awhile? To-morrow, if you will, I will hear your narrative; but to-day I wish to nurse you carefully. Besides," he said, "a treasure is not a thing we need hurry about." </p> 
<p>"On the contrary, it is a matter of the utmost importance, Edmond!" replied the old man. "Who knows if to-morrow, or the next day after, the third attack may not come on? and then must not all be over? Yes, indeed, I have often thought with a bitter joy that these riches, which would make the wealth of a dozen families, will be forever lost to those men who persecute me. This idea was one of vengeance to me, and I tasted it slowly in the night of my dungeon and the despair of my captivity. But now I have forgiven the world for the love of you; now that I see you, young and with a promising future,--now that I think of all that may result to you in the good fortune of such a disclosure, I shudder at any delay, and tremble lest I should not assure to one as worthy as yourself the possession of so vast an amount of hidden wealth." Edmond turned away his head with a sigh. </p> 
<p>"You persist in your incredulity, Edmond," continued Faria. "My words have not convinced you. I see you require proofs. Well, then, read this paper, which I have never shown to any one." </p> 
<p>"To-morrow, my dear friend," said Edmond, desirous of not yielding to the old man's madness. "I thought it was understood that we should not talk of that until to-morrow." </p> 
<p>"Then we will not talk of it until to-morrow; but read this paper to-day." </p> 
<p>"I will not irritate him," thought Edmond, and taking the paper, of which half was wanting, having been burnt, no doubt, by some accident, he read: </p> 
<p>"This treasure, which may amount to two </p> 
<p>of Roman crowns in the most distant a </p> 
<p>of the second opening wh </p> 
<p>declare to belong to him alo </p> 
<p>heir. </p> 
<p>"25th April, l49" </p> 
<p>"Well!" said Faria, when the young man had finished reading it. </p> 
<p>"Why," replied Dantès, "I see nothing but broken lines and unconnected words, which are rendered illegible by fire." </p> 
<p>"Yes, to you, my friend, who read them for the first time; but not for me, who have grown pale over them by many nights' study, and have reconstructed every phrase, completed every thought." </p> 
<p>"And do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning?" </p> 
<p>"I am sure I have, and you shall judge for yourself; but first listen to the history of this paper." </p> 
<p>"Silence!" exclaimed Dantès. "Steps approach--I go--adieu." </p> 
<p>And Dantès, happy to escape the history and explanation which would be sure to confirm his belief in his friend's mental instability, glided like a snake along the narrow passage; while Faria, restored by his alarm to a certain amount of activity, pushed the stone into place with his foot, and covered it with a mat in order the more effectually to avoid discovery. </p> 
<p>It was the governor, who, hearing of Faria's illness from the jailer, had come in person to see him. </p> 
<p>Faria sat up to receive him, avoiding all gestures in order that he might conceal from the governor the paralysis that had already half stricken him with death. His fear was lest the governor, touched with pity, might order him to be removed to better quarters, and thus separate him from his young companion. But fortunately this was not the case, and the governor left him, convinced that the poor madman, for whom in his heart he felt a kind of affection, was only troubled with a slight indisposition. </p> 
<p>During this time, Edmond, seated on his bed with his head in his hands, tried to collect his scattered thoughts. Faria, since their first acquaintance, had been on all points so rational and logical, so wonderfully sagacious, in fact, that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all points could be allied with madness. Was Faria deceived as to his treasure, or was all the world deceived as to Faria? </p> 
<p>Dantès remained in his cell all day, not daring to return to his friend, thinking thus to defer the moment when he should be convinced, once for all, that the abbé was mad--such a conviction would be so terrible! </p> 
<p>But, towards the evening after the hour for the customary visit had gone by, Faria, not seeing the young man appear, tried to move and get over the distance which separated them. Edmond shuddered when he heard the painful efforts which the old man made to drag himself along; his leg was inert, and he could no longer make use of one arm. Edmond was obliged to assist him, for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small aperture which led to Dantès' chamber. </p> 
<p>"Here I am, pursuing you remorselessly," he said with a benignant smile. "You thought to escape my munificence, but it is in vain. Listen to me." </p> 
<p>Edmond saw there was no escape, and placing the old man on his bed, he seated himself on the stool beside him. </p> 
<p>"You know," said the abbé, "that I was the secretary and intimate friend of Cardinal Spada, the last of the princes of that name. I owe to this worthy lord all the happiness I ever knew. He was not rich, although the wealth of his family had passed into a proverb, and I heard the phrase very often, 'As rich as a Spada.' But he, like public rumor, lived on this reputation for wealth; his palace was my paradise. I was tutor to his nephews, who are dead; and when he was alone in the world, I tried by absolute devotion to his will, to make up to him all he had done for me during ten years of unremitting kindness. The cardinal's house had no secrets for me. I had often seen my noble patron annotating ancient volumes, and eagerly searching amongst dusty family manuscripts. One day when I was reproaching him for his unavailing searches, and deploring the prostration of mind that followed them, he looked at me, and, smiling bitterly, opened a volume relating to the History of the City of Rome. There, in the twentieth chapter of the Life of Pope Alexander VI, were the following lines, which I can never forget:-- </p> 
<p>"'The great wars of Romagna had ended; C?sar Borgia, who had completed his conquest, had need of money to purchase all Italy. The pope had also need of money to bring matters to an end with Louis XII. King of France, who was formidable still in spite of his recent reverses; and it was necessary, therefore, to have recourse to some profitable scheme, which was a matter of great difficulty in the impoverished condition of exhausted Italy. His holiness had an idea. He determined to make two cardinals.' </p> 
<p>"By choosing two of the greatest personages of Rome, especially rich men--this was the return the holy father looked for. In the first place, he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the cardinals already held; and then he had the two hats to sell besides. There was a third point in view, which will appear hereafter. The pope and C?sar Borgia first found the two future cardinals; they were Giovanni Rospigliosi, who held four of the highest dignities of the Holy See, and C?sar Spada, one of the noblest and richest of the Roman nobility; both felt the high honor of such a favor from the pope. They were ambitious, and C?sar Borgia soon found purchasers for their appointments. The result was, that Rospigliosi and Spada paid for being cardinals, and eight other persons paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation, and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the speculators. </p> 
<p>"It is time now to proceed to the last part of the speculation. The pope heaped attentions upon Rospigliosi and Spada, conferred upon them the insignia of the cardinalate, and induced them to arrange their affairs and take up their residence at Rome. Then the pope and C?sar Borgia invited the two cardinals to dinner. This was a matter of dispute between the holy father and his son. C?sar thought they could make use of one of the means which he always had ready for his friends, that is to say, in the first place, the famous key which was given to certain persons with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard. This key was furnished with a small iron point,--a negligence on the part of the locksmith. When this was pressed to effect the opening of the cupboard, of which the lock was difficult, the person was pricked by this small point, and died next day. Then there was the ring with the lion's head, which C?sar wore when he wanted to greet his friends with a clasp of the hand. The lion bit the hand thus favored, and at the end of twenty-four hours, the bite was mortal. C?sar proposed to his father, that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard, or shake hands with them; but Alexander VI., replied: 'Now as to the worthy cardinals, Spada and Rospigliosi, let us ask both of them to dinner, something tells me that we shall get that money back. Besides, you forget, C?sar, an indigestion declares itself immediately, while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a day or two.' C?sar gave way before such cogent reasoning, and the cardinals were consequently invited to dinner. </p> 
<p>"The table was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope, near San Pierdarena, a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by report. Rospigliosi, quite set up with his new dignities, went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating manner. Spada, a prudent man, and greatly attached to his only nephew, a young captain of the highest promise, took paper and pen, and made his will. He then sent word to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard; but it appeared the servant did not find him. </p> 
<p>"Spada knew what these invitations meant; since Christianity, so eminently civilizing, had made progress in Rome, it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message, 'C?sar wills that you die.' but it was a legate a latere, who came with a smile on his lips to say from the pope, 'His holiness requests you to dine with him.' </p> 
<p>"Spada set out about two o'clock to San Pierdarena. The pope awaited him. The first sight that attracted the eyes of Spada was that of his nephew, in full costume, and C?sar Borgia paying him most marked attentions. Spada turned pale, as C?sar looked at him with an ironical air, which proved that he had anticipated all, and that the snare was well spread. They began dinner and Spada was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message. The nephew replied no; perfectly comprehending the meaning of the question. It was too late, for he had already drunk a glass of excellent wine, placed for him expressly by the pope's butler. Spada at the same moment saw another bottle approach him, which he was pressed to taste. An hour afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms. Spada died on the threshold of the vineyard; the nephew expired at his own door, making signs which his wife could not comprehend. </p> 
<p>"Then C?sar and the pope hastened to lay hands on the heritage, under presence of seeking for the papers of the dead man. But the inheritance consisted in this only, a scrap of paper on which Spada had written:--'I bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers, my books, and, amongst others, my breviary with the gold corners, which I beg he will preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle.' </p> 
<p>"The heirs sought everywhere, admired the breviary, laid hands on the furniture, and were greatly astonished that Spada, the rich man, was really the most miserable of uncles--no treasures--unless they were those of science, contained in the library and laboratories. That was all. C?sar and his father searched, examined, scrutinized, but found nothing, or at least very little; not exceeding a few thousand crowns in plate, and about the same in ready money; but the nephew had time to say to his wife before he expired: 'Look well among my uncle's papers; there is a will.' </p> 
<p>"They sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done, but it was fruitless. There were two palaces and a vineyard behind the Palatine Hill; but in these days landed property had not much value, and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the family since they were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his son. Months and years rolled on. Alexander VI. died, poisoned,--you know by what mistake. C?sar, poisoned at the same time, escaped by shedding his skin like a snake; but the new skin was spotted by the poison till it looked like a tiger's. Then, compelled to quit Rome, he went and got himself obscurely killed in a night skirmish, scarcely noticed in history. After the pope's death and his son's exile, it was supposed that the Spada family would resume the splendid position they had held before the cardinal's time; but this was not the case. The Spadas remained in doubtful ease, a mystery hung over this dark affair, and the public rumor was, that C?sar, a better politician than his father, had carried off from the pope the fortune of the two cardinals. I say the two, because Cardinal Rospigliosi, who had not taken any precaution, was completely despoiled. </p> 
<p>"Up to this point," said Faria, interrupting the thread of his narrative, "this seems to you very meaningless, no doubt, eh?" </p> 
<p>"Oh, my friend," cried Dantès, "on the contrary, it seems as if I were reading a most interesting narrative; go on, I beg of you." </p> 
<p>"I will." </p> 
<p>"The family began to get accustomed to their obscurity. Years rolled on, and amongst the descendants some were soldiers, others diplomatists; some churchmen, some bankers; some grew rich, and some were ruined. I come now to the last of the family, whose secretary I was--the Count of Spada. I had often heard him complain of the disproportion of his rank with his fortune; and I advised him to invest all he had in an annuity. He did so, and thus doubled his income. The celebrated breviary remained in the family, and was in the count's possession. It had been handed down from father to son; for the singular clause of the only will that had been found, had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic, preserved in the family with superstitious veneration. It was an illuminated book, with beautiful Gothic characters, and so weighty with gold, that a servant always carried it before the cardinal on days of great solemnity. </p> 
<p>"At the sight of papers of all sorts,--titles, contracts, parchments, which were kept in the archives of the family, all descending from the poisoned cardinal, I in my turn examined the immense bundles of documents, like twenty servitors, stewards, secretaries before me; but in spite of the most exhaustive researches, I found--nothing. Yet I had read, I had even written a precise history of the Borgia family, for the sole purpose of assuring myself whether any increase of fortune had occurred to them on the death of the Cardinal C?sar Spada; but could only trace the acquisition of the property of the Cardinal Rospigliosi, his companion in misfortune. </p> 
<p>" I was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the Borgias nor the family, but had remained unpossessed like the treasures of the Arabian Nights, which slept in the bosom of the earth under the eyes of the genie. I searched, ransacked, counted, calculated a thousand and a thousand times the income and expenditure of the family for three hundred years. It was useless. I remained in my ignorance, and the Count of Spada in his poverty. My patron died. He had reserved from his annuity his family papers, his library, composed of five thousand volumes, and his famous breviary. All these he bequeathed to me, with a thousand Roman crowns, which he had in ready money, on condition that I would have anniversary masses said for the repose of his soul, and that I would draw up a genealogical tree and history of his house. All this I did scrupulously. Be easy, my dear Edmond, we are near the conclusion. </p> 
<p>"In 1807, a month before I was arrested, and a fortnight after the death of the Count of Spada, on the 25th of December (you will see presently how the date became fixed in my memory), I was reading, for the thousandth time, the papers I was arranging, for the palace was sold to a stranger, and I was going to leave Rome and settle at Florence, intending to take with me twelve thousand francs I possessed, my library, and the famous breviary, when, tired with my constant labor at the same thing, and overcome by a heavy dinner I had eaten, my head dropped on my hands, and I fell asleep about three o'clock in the afternoon. I awoke as the clock was striking six. I raised my head; I was in utter darkness. I rang for a light, but as no one came, I determined to find one for myself. It was indeed but anticipating the simple manners which I should soon be under the necessity of adopting. I took a wax-candle in one hand, and with the other groped about for a piece of paper (my match-box being empty), with which I proposed to get a light from the small flame still playing on the embers. Fearing, however, to make use of any valuable piece of paper, I hesitated for a moment, then recollected that I had seen in the famous breviary, which was on the table beside me, an old paper quite yellow with age, and which had served as a marker for centuries, kept there by the request of the heirs. I felt for it, found it, twisted it up together, and putting it into the expiring flame, set light to it. </p> 
<p>"But beneath my fingers, as if by magic, in proportion as the fire ascended, I saw yellowish characters appear on the paper. I grasped it in my hand, put out the flame as quickly as I could, lighted my taper in the fire itself, and opened the crumpled paper with inexpressible emotion, recognizing, when I had done so, that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink, only appearing when exposed to the fire; nearly one-third of the paper had been consumed by the flame. It was that paper you read this morning; read it again, Dantès, and then I will complete for you the incomplete words and unconnected sense." </p> 
<p>Faria, with an air of triumph, offered the paper to Dantès, who this time read the following words, traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust:-- </p> 
<p>"This 25th day of April, 1498, be... </p>

<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p>"C?s... </p> 
<p>"25th April, 1498. </p> 
<p>"And now," said the abbé, "read this other paper;" and he presented to Dantès a second leaf with fragments of lines written on it, which Edmond read as follows:-- </p> 
<p>"...ing invited to dine by his Holiness </p> 
<p>...content with making me pay for my hat, </p> 
<p>...serves for me the fate of Cardinals Caprara </p> 
<p>...I declare to my nephew, Guido Spada </p>

<p>...ngle in the second; </p> 
<p>...tire to him </p> 
<p>...ar Spada." </p> 
<p>Faria followed him with an excited look. "and now," he said, when he saw that Dantès had read the last line, "put the two fragments together, and judge for yourself." Dantès obeyed, and the conjointed pieces gave the following:-- </p> 
<p>"This 25th day of April, 1498, be...ing invited to dine by his Holiness Alexander VI., and fearing that not...content with making me pay for my hat, he may desire to become my heir, and re...serves for me the fate of Cardinals Caprara and Bentivoglio, who were poisoned...I declare to my nephew, Guido Spada, my sole heir, that I have bu...ried in a place he knows and has visited with me, that is, in...the caves of the small Island of Monte Cristo all I poss...ssed of ingots, gold, money, jewels, diamonds, gems; that I alone...know of the existence of this treasure, which may amount to nearly two mil...lions of Roman crowns, and which he will find on raising the twentieth ro...ck from the small creek to the east in a right line.

<p>"25th April, 1498. </p> 
<p>"C?s...ar Spada." </p> 
<p>"Well, do you comprehend now?" inquired Faria. </p> 
<p>"It is the declaration of Cardinal Spada, and the will so long sought for," replied Edmond, still incredulous. </p> 
<p>"Yes; a thousand times, yes!" </p> 
<p>"And who completed it as it now is?" </p> 
<p>"I did. Aided by the remaining fragment, I guessed the rest; measuring the length of the lines by those of the paper, and divining the hidden meaning by means of what was in part revealed, as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of light above us." </p> 
<p>"And what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion?" </p> 
<p>"I resolved to set out, and did set out at that very instant, carrying with me the beginning of my great work, the unity of the Italian kingdom; but for some time the imperial police (who at this period, quite contrary to what Napoleon desired so soon as he had a son born to him, wished for a partition of provinces) had their eyes on me; and my hasty departure, the cause of which they were unable to guess, having aroused their suspicions, I was arrested at the very moment I was leaving Piombino. </p> 
<p>"Now," continued Faria, addressing Dantès with an almost paternal expression, "now, my dear fellow, you know as much as I do myself. If we ever escape together, half this treasure is yours; if I die here, and you escape alone, the whole belongs to you." </p> 
<p>"But," inquired Dantès hesitating, "has this treasure no more legitimate possessor in the world than ourselves?" </p> 
<p>"No, no, be easy on that score; the family is extinct. The last Count of Spada, moreover, made me his heir, bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary, he bequeathed to me all it contained; no, no, make your mind satisfied on that point. If we lay hands on this fortune, we may enjoy it without remorse." </p> 
<p>"And you say this treasure amounts to"-- </p> 
<p>"Two millions of Roman crowns; nearly thirteen millions of our money." [1] </p> 
<p>"Impossible!" said Dantès, staggered at the enormous amount. </p> 
<p>"Impossible? and why?" asked the old man. "The Spada family was one of the oldest and most powerful families of the fifteenth century; and in those times, when other opportunities for investment were wanting, such accumulations of gold and jewels were by no means rare; there are at this day Roman families perishing of hunger, though possessed of nearly a million in diamonds and jewels, handed down by entail, and which they cannot touch." Edmond thought he was in a dream--he wavered between incredulity and joy. </p> 
<p>"I have only kept this secret so long from you," continued Faria, "that I might test your character, and then surprise you. Had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy, I should have conducted you to Monte Cristo; now," he added, with a sigh, "it is you who will conduct me thither. Well, Dantès, you do not thank me?" </p> 
<p>"This treasure belongs to you, my dear friend," replied Dantès, "and to you only. I have no right to it. I am no relation of yours." </p>  
<p>第二天早晨，当唐太斯回到他难友的房间里时，他看见法利亚坐在那儿，神色安祥。一束阳光透过牢房那狭小的窗口射了进来，他左手拿着一张展开的纸，读者记得他只有这只手可以用了。这片纸因为先前一直被卷着，所以变成了一个卷，很不容易打开。他不说话，只把那张纸给唐太斯看。 </p> 
<p>“那是什么？”后者问道。 </p> 
<p>“看。”神甫微笑着。 </p> 
<p>“我已经仔细地看过啦，”唐太斯说，“我只看到一张烧掉了一半的纸，上面有些哥拧体的文字，好象是用一种特别的墨水写的。” </p> 
<p>“这片纸，我的朋友，”法利亚说，“既然我已经考验过你了，现在可以把我的秘密告诉你了，这片纸就是我的宝藏。从今天起，这个宝藏的一半是属于你的了。”唐太斯的额头冒出一阵冷汗。到这一天为止，经过了这么长的一段时间，他始终避免和神甫谈及有关他的宝藏的事，因为这是他发疯的病根。 </p> 
<p>生性谨慎的爱德蒙处处留意，避免触及这根痛苦的心弦，而法利亚在这方面也同样保持着沉默。他把神甫的这种沉默看作是理智的恢复，可现在，法利亚经过了这样痛苦的一场剧变以后又吐出了这些话，这说明他的神经错乱又复发了。 </p> 
<p>“你的宝藏？”唐太斯结结巴巴地问道。 </p> 
<p>法利亚微笑了一下。“是的，”他说，“你的心地的确很高尚，爱德蒙。因为我看你脸色苍白，浑身发抖，就知道你此刻心里在想些什么。不，你放心，我没有疯。这个宝藏的确存在，唐太斯。假如我不能去拥有它们，你可以去拥有它们，是的，你。 </p> 
<p>谁都不相信我的话，因为他们以为我是疯子。但是你，你该知道我并没有疯，假如你愿意的话，你一定会相信的。” </p> 
<p>“糟糕！”爱德蒙喃喃地对自己说，“他的老病又犯了！我就差没得这种病了。”然后他大声说道，“我亲爱的朋友，你刚才发病时大概累着了，你先休息一会儿，好吧？假如你高兴，明天我再来听你讲。今天我只希望能好好地照料你。而且，”他又说，“宝藏对我们并不是很急迫的事呀。” </p> 
<p>“非常紧急，爱德蒙！”神甫回答说。“谁知道我的病会不会在明天或后天第三次发作呢？那时就一切都完啦。这些财宝可使十家人变成巨富，我常常想，就让它们永远埋没吧，决不能让那些迫害我的人得到它们，每有这种想法，心里虽不免带点苦味，却还觉得相当畅快。这种想法也满足了我的报复心，我在这黑牢的夜里在这囚禁生活的绝望中，正在慢慢地体味其中的快意。但是现在，我已因为出于对你的爱宽恕了世界。 </p> 
<p>现在，我看到你还很年轻，前途远大，我想，这个秘密一经泄露，你就可以得到一切幸福，我深怕再耽误一分钟一秒钟，深怕失掉象你这样一个可敬的人来拥有这样巨大的宝藏。” </p> 
<p>爱德蒙扭过头去叹息了一声。 </p> 
<p>“你仍然不肯相信，爱德蒙，”法利亚继续说道。“我的话还无法使你相信。看来你需要证据。好吧，那么，且念一念这张纸吧，这张纸我从没给别人看过。” </p> 
<p>“明天吧，我亲爱的朋友，”爱德蒙说，他不愿顺从神甫的疯狂。“我们已说定到明天再去谈它嘛。” </p> 
<p>“那就把它留到明天再谈吧，但今天先念一念这张纸吧。” </p> 
<p>“别惹他生气。”爱德蒙心里想，于是便接过那张缺了一半，显然因为某次意外而被火烧过的纸来，念道—— </p> 
<p>今日为一四九八年四月历山大六世之邀，应召赴宴，献之款，而望成为吾之继承人，则将凯普勒拉及宾铁伏格里奥归于被毒死者），吾今向吾之帕达，宣布：吾曾在一彼所知地点（在基督山小岛之洞窟银条，金块，宝石，钻石，美余一人知之，其总值约及罗马艾居二开岛东小港右手第二十块岩洞口二处；宝藏系在第二洞口最吾全部遗与吾之惟一继承人。 </p> 
<p>凯 </p> 
<p>一四九八年四月二十五日 </p> 
<p>“怎么样？”法利亚在年轻人读完以后问道。 </p> 
<p>“可是，”唐太斯答道，“我看到的只不过是一张被火烧掉了一半的，上面是一些意义不明的断句残字呀。” </p> 
<p>“是的，我的朋友，对你是这样，因为你才第一次读到它。 </p> 
<p>但对我却不然，我曾费尽心血，熬了许多个夜晚来研究它，把每一个句子都重新写了出来，把每一处意思都作了完整的补充。” </p> 
<p>“你认为你已经找到了另一半的意思了吗？” </p> 
<p>“我完全可以肯定，你可以自己来判断，但先来听我讲一讲这张纸的来历吧。” </p> 
<p>“别出声！”唐太斯轻声叫道。“有脚步声！我走啦再会！” </p> 
<p>说着唐太斯象一条蛇似地钻进了狭窄的地道里，他很高兴能逃避去听那个故事和解释，因为这些只能使他更加确信他的难友又犯病了；至于法利亚，他在惊惶之中倒恢复了一种活力，他用脚把那块石头推到原位，又拿一张草席盖在上面，使它不易被发现。 </p> 
<p>来者是监狱长，他从狱卒那儿得知了法利亚的病情，所以亲自来看看他。 </p> 
<p>法利亚坐起身来见他，尽量避免做出任何引起怀疑的举动，他向典狱长隐瞒了他这半身瘫痪的实情。他深恐典狱长会对他萌发恻隐之心。把他换到一间较好的牢房里去那样就会把他和他的年轻伙伴分开。幸亏这种事并没有发生，监狱长离开他的时候认为那个可怜的疯子只是身体略感不适而已，心里倒也有一些同情他。 </p> 
<p>但此时，爱德蒙正坐在床上，双手捧着头，竭力在聚精会神地回想。自从他认识法利亚以来，觉得后者身上一切都显得那样的理智、伟大和崇高，他不懂为什么一个在各方面都这样富于智慧的人竟会在某一点上失去理智。究竟是法利亚被他的宝藏所迷惑了呢，还是全世界都误解了法利亚？ </p> 
<p>唐太斯整个白天都呆在他的牢房里，不敢再回到他的朋友那儿去心想这样就可以拖延一些时候，使自己慢一点来证实神甫真的疯了，他是多么怕证实这一点！ </p> 
<p>到了傍晚时分，常规的查监过后，法利亚不见年轻人过来，就试着自己去穿过那条通道。他的一条腿已不能动弹了，一只手臂也已不能再用了，所以他只能拖着身子爬过来。爱德蒙一听到神甫那痛苦挣扎的声音，就不禁打了个寒颤。他不得不勉强迎上前去帮他一把，因为否则老人是无法从那通向唐太斯房间的小洞口钻过来的。 </p> 
<p>“我来了，不顾一切地追到你这儿来了，”他慈祥地向他笑着说。“你以为可以逃避我慷慨的馈赠，但这是没有用的。听我说吧。” </p> 
<p>爱德蒙看到已无法逃避，便扶神甫坐到他的床上，自己则拖过长登坐在他的旁边。“你知道，”神甫说道，“我是红衣主教斯帕达的秘书，也是他的密友，而他是斯帕达亲王这一族中最后的一位。我一生的全部幸福都是这位可敬的爵爷所赐于的。 </p> 
<p>尽管我曾时常听人说‘象斯帕达那样富有但他本人并不富有，外面有此谣言所以他也就在一个富有的虚名下生活。他的宫殿就是我的天堂。我曾教过他的侄子，那个人现在已经死了。 </p> 
<p>当他只剩下孤家寡人的时候，我就回到了他那儿，决心要照料他，以此来报答十年来他对我的恩情。红衣主教的家事我简直可以说无所不知。我常常看到我那高贵的爵爷在辛辛苦苦地注释古书，费劲地在灰尘之中翻寻祖先的遗稿。有一天，我埋怨他不该作这种于事无益的搜寻，以致把自己弄得身心疲惫，他看了看我，然后苦笑着打开一大卷述及罗马城历史的书。他翻到书中记述教皇亚历山大六世生平的第二十九章，上面有这么几句话，那是我永远也忘不了的。 </p> 
<p>“‘罗马尼大战业已结束。凯撒·布琪亚完成其征服事业以后，急需款子购买意大利全境。教皇便急需款子摆脱法国国王路易十二，故必须借助于某种有利的交易活动，然而在意大利遍地穷困之状况下，此事极其为难。教皇陛下想到了一个主意，决定册封两位红衣主教’”。 </p> 
<p>“假如在罗马挑选两个伟大的人物，尤其是大富翁，则圣父［教皇亚历山大六世］就可以从这项交易里获到以下利益。第一，他可以把这两个红衣主教属下的大官美缺出卖；第二是红衣主教这两顶高帽子也可以卖不少钱。这项交易还有第三种好处，下面将要讲到。教皇和凯撒·布琪亚先找到了这两位未来的红衣主教，他们是琪恩·罗斯辟格里奥赛和凯撒·斯帕达，前者已在教廷里挂着四种最高的头衔，后者则是罗马贵族中最高贵和最富有的。两位都对教皇的这种情意感到无上的光荣。他们都是很有野心的。这事一经确定，凯撒·布琪亚不久就又找到了出钱买红衣主教手下官职的人。结果是罗斯辟格里奥赛和斯帕达花钱当上了红衣主教，而在他们还不曾正式荣升之前，已另外有八个人花钱当了主教以前所托的职位，而八十万艾居就此进了这笔交易的卖主的金库里。 </p> 
<p>“现在该讲讲这项交易的最后一部分了。教皇对罗斯辟格里奥赛和斯巴达，既赐他们以红衣主教的勋章，又劝他们把不动产都变卖成现钱，使他们在罗马定居下来，教皇和凯撒·布琪亚还设宴招待这两位红衣主教。这是圣父和他的儿子［指凯撒·布琪亚。］之间的一场争论。凯撒心里可以使用对付他的老朋友的一个惯用手法。即可以用那把出了名的钥匙，他们请某个人拿了这把钥匙去打开一只指定的碗柜。这把钥匙上有一个小小的铁刺，那是锁匠一时疏忽留下来的。那把锁很难开，当这个人用力去开碗柜的时候，钥匙上的小刺就刺破了他的皮，而他第二天他必将死去。此外还有那只狮头戒指，凯撒每当要与人紧紧握手的时候就把它戴上。狮头便会咬破那只承恩的手，而在二十四小时以后，那咬破的小伤口便会致命。所以凯撒向他的父亲建议，或是请这两位红衣主教去开碗柜，或是与他们每人亲热地紧握一次手。但亚历山大六世回答他说：‘想到罗斯辟格里奥赛和斯帕达这两位可敬的红衣主教，我们就别计较一顿晚宴的费用了。我总觉得，我们可以把他们的钱弄过来的。而且，你忘记啦，凯撒，消化不良会立刻发作的，而刺一下或咬一下却要在一两天以后才能见结果。’凯撒听了这番头头是道的话后就让步了。两位红衣主教要因此就被邀赴宴了。 </p> 
<p>“宴席摆在圣皮埃尔—埃里斯兰宫附近教皇的一个葡萄园里，两位红衣主教早就听说那是一个很幽静可爱的地方。罗斯辟格里奥赛真是受宠若惊，乐得忘乎所以了，他穿上最漂亮的衣服，准备赴宴。斯帕达却是一个很谨慎小心的人，他只有一个侄子，是一个前途远大的青年军官，他对他极其钟爱，所以他拿出笔和纸，写下了他的遗嘱。然后就派人去找他的侄子，要他在葡萄园附近等候他，可是仆人似乎没有找到他。“斯帕达很清楚这种邀请的意义。自基督教问世以来，罗马的文明已大有进步了，现在不再会有一个百夫长来传达暴君的口信：‘凯撒赐你死！’而是由教皇派来一个特使，面带微笑地说：‘教皇陛下请你去赴宴。’“斯帕达在两点钟左右动身到了圣皮埃尔斯里安宫的葡萄园里。教皇已在等着他了。斯帕达第一眼看到的人就是他那穿着全套盛装的侄子，和对他虎视眈眈地望着他的凯撒·布琪亚。斯帕达的脸立刻变青了，而凯撒却带着一种讥讽的神色望了望他，证明一切都不出他之所料，天罗地网已经布下了。他们开始进餐，斯帕达只来得及问了他的侄子一句话，问他有没有接到他的口信，侄子回答说没有，他已完全明白了这句问话的意义。但是太晚啦，因为他已经喝下了一杯教皇膳食总管特地捧到他面前的美酒。同时，斯帕达看见他自己的面前又添了一瓶酒，他被劝喝了几大杯。一小时以后，医生宣布他们两个人都因食有了羊脏菌而中毒身亡。斯帕达死在葡萄园的门口。他的侄子在他自己的家门口断的气，临死前还做了一些手势，但他的妻子不懂其中的含意。 </p> 
<p>“凯撒和教皇迫不及待去抢遗产，借口是去找死者的文件。但遗产仅止于此，即斯帕达在一小片纸上写到：吾将吾之库藏及书籍赠与吾所钟爱之侄，其中有吾之金角祈祷书一本，吾盼其能善为保存，借作其爱叔之留念。 </p> 
<p>抢夺遗产者四处寻找，仔仔细细地翻看了那本祈祷书，又把家具都翻来复去的察看了一遍，他们不由得都大吃一惊，原来这位以富有闻名的叔父斯巴达，实际上却是一位最可怜的叔父。说到财宝，除了那些在图书馆和实验室里的科学珍品以外，别的一点都没有。事情就是这样：凯撒和他的父亲到处寻找，到处搜查，到处仔细地察看，但却什么也没找到，或者说东西少得可怜，只有几千艾居的金条，和大约相同数目的现钱。 </p> 
<p>不过侄子在他断气以前，还来得及对他的妻子说过一句话：‘仔细在我叔父的文件里找，里面有真正的遗嘱。’“他们又去寻找，甚至比那两位尊严的继承人找得还彻底，但仍然是毫无结果。王府后面有两座宫殿和一个葡萄园，但当时不动产还不那么值钱，不能满足教皇和他儿子的胃口，这两座宫殿和那葡萄园仍归家族所有。光阴似水流过，亚历山大六世死了，是中毒死的，你知道那是怎么错杀了的。凯撒也同时中了毒，不过他的皮肤并没有变成蛇皮的颜色，毒药只使他的皮肤起了很多斑点，象蒙上了一张老虎皮一样。于是，他被迫离开罗马，在一次精历史学家所遗忘的夜间的小战斗中被人莫名其妙地打死了。在教皇去世和他的儿子被放逐以后，大家以为斯怕达这一族又要象他们当红衣主教那个时代那样发达起来了，但事实却并不如此。斯帕达这一族人依旧只是勉强过得去，这桩黑暗的事件始终被笼罩在迷中雾中。一般的谣传是，那政治手腕比他父亲高强的凯撒已从教皇那儿夺了两位红衣主教的财产带走了。我说两位，是指还有那位红衣主教罗斯辟格里奥赛，他由于事先毫无准备，所以完全被抢光了。” </p> 
<p>“讲到这里为止，”法利亚打断自己的话头说，“你一定觉得这非常荒唐吧？” </p> 
<p>“噢，我的朋友，”唐太斯说道，“正相反，我好象是在读一本最有趣的故事，请你说下去吧。” </p> 
<p>“我继续说下去，斯帕达这家族的人开始习惯于这种平庸的生活了。许多年又过去了，在他们后代之中，有的当了军人，有的当了外交家，有的当了教士，有成了银行家，有的发了财，有的破了产。我现在要讲的是这个家族的最后一位，就是斯帕达伯爵，我当过他的秘书，常常听到他抱怨，说他的爵位和他的财产太不相称。我就劝他把全部财产都变成定期存款。他照办了，因此收入就增加了一倍。那本著名的祈祷书仍由这个家族的人保存着，现在已归伯爵所有。这是由父传子，子传孙一路传下来的，由于所找到的遗嘱上有那么一句话，所以它变成了一件真正的传家之宝，族里的人都带着迷信的崇敬之感把它好好地保存着。这本书上的大写字母都是用金银彩色写成的，全书都是美丽的歌特体的文字，由于包金的缘故，份量很重，所以每到大的日子，总得由一个仆人把它捧到红衣主教面前。” </p> 
<p>“那各种各样的文件，有诏书，契约，公文等，这一切都藏在档案柜里，从那被毒死的红衣主教开始一直传下来，全族人的文件都在这里了，我也象在我以前的那二十位侍仆，管家和秘书一样，把那庞大的文件堆又查看了一遍。虽说我经过了最认真仔细的研究，但结果还是一场空。我把布琪亚那个家族人的历史详详细细地读了一遍，甚至还把它写成了一部书，唯一的目的，就是想研究出他们有没有因红衣主教凯撒·斯帕达的死而增加了任何财富。但我发现他们只得了他的同难人红衣主教罗斯辟格里奥赛的产业。” </p> 
<p>“当时我就几乎肯定，那笔遗产并没有被布琪亚那一族人或他的本族人得去那依旧是一笔无主之财，象《一千零一夜》故事里的宝藏一样，仍在大地的怀抱里，由一个魔鬼看守着。 </p> 
<p>我无数次地搜索考查，把那一族人三百年来的收入和支出算了又算，简直不下千百次，还是没有用。我仍然茫然无所知，而斯帕达伯爵仍然穷困潦倒。我的东家死了。他除了定期存款以外，还保存着他的家族文件，他那藏有五千卷书的图书和他那著名的祈祷书。这一切他都遗赠了给我，还有一笔一千罗马艾居的现款，条件是要我每年给他举行一次弥撒，祈祷他的灵魂安息，并叫我给他编一本族谱，写一部家史。这一切我都一丝不苟的照办了。别着急，我亲爱的爱德蒙，我们就要讲到最后这段了。” </p> 
<p>“一八○七年十二月二十五日，在我被捕的前一个月，也就是斯帕达伯爵去世后的第十五天，你看，那个日期在我的记忆里印得多深刻，我一边整理文件，一边把这些读过千百次的东西又看了一遍，因为那座宫殿已卖给了一个陌生人，我就要离开罗马，去定居在佛罗伦萨，同时准备带走我所有的一万二千里弗，我的藏书和那本著名的祈祷书，由于长时间的翻阅这些资料，我感到疲倦极了，加之午餐又吃得太饱，所以我竟用手垫着头睡过去了，那时约莫下午三点钟。当我醒来的时候，时钟正敲六点。我抬起头来，四周是一片黑暗。我拉铃叫人拿灯来，但没有人来，我就决定自己去弄一个。这原是一种哲学家的脾气，但这时我是非这样做不可了。我用一手拿着一支蜡烛，由于我的火柴盒子已经空了，一手去摸索一片纸，想拿它到壁炉的余火里去点燃。我担心在黑暗之中用掉的是一张有价值的纸，所以我迟疑了一会儿，然后想到，在那本著名的祈祷书里我曾见过一张因年代久远而发黄了的纸片，这张纸片，几世纪来都被人当作书签用，只是由于世代子孙尊重遗物，所以还把它保存在那儿。那本祈祷书就在我身旁的桌子上，我摸索了一会儿，找到了那张纸，把它扭成一条，按到将熄的火焰上面，点燃了它。” </p> 
<p>“但在我的手指底下，象施了魔法似的，当那火苗窜起的时候，只见纸上现出了淡黄色的字迹。我吓了一跳。赶急把那张纸抓在手里，扑灭了火，直接点燃了那支小蜡烛，然后带着难以表达的激动心情摊开了那张扭皱了的纸。我发觉那上面的字是用神秘的隐显墨水写的，只有拿到火上去烘才会显现出来。那张纸有三分之一多一点已被火烧掉了。剩下的就是你今天早晨的那张碎纸片，把它再念一遍吧，唐太斯，读过以后我再把那些残破的句子和互不连贯的意义给你补充上。” </p> 
<p>法利亚洋洋得意地把那张纸交给了唐太斯，后者这次又把下列这些铁锈色的字句读了一遍：—— </p> 
<p>今日为一四九八年四月历山大六世之邀，应召赴宴，献之款，而望成为吾之继承人，则将凯普勒拉及宾铁伏格里奥归于被毒死者），吾今向吾之帕达，宣布：吾曾在一彼所知地点（在基督山小岛之洞窟银条，金块，宝石，钻石，美余一人知之，其总值约及罗马艾居二开岛东小港右手第二十块岩洞口二处；宝藏系在第二洞口最吾全部遗与吾之惟一继承人。 </p> 
<p>凯 </p> 
<p>一四九八年四月二十五日 </p> 
<p>“现在，”神甫说，“再念一念这张纸；”说着他把第二张纸给了唐太斯，那上面也有一些残缺的句子，爱德蒙读道：——二十五日，吾受教皇圣下亚恐彼或不满于吾捐衔所令吾与红衣主教同一之命运（彼二人系惟一继承人，吾侄葛陀·斯悉并曾与吾同往游览之中）埋藏余所有之全部金玉；此项宝藏之存在仅百万；彼仅须打石，即可获得。此窟共有深之一角；此项宝藏撒十斯帕达 </p> 
<p>法利亚用兴奋的目光注视着他。“现在，”当他看到唐太斯已念到最后一行的时候说，“把两片残纸拼拢起来，你就可以自己判断了。”唐太斯照着做了，合起来的那两片纸上的内容如下： </p> 
<p>今日为一四九八年四月——二十五日，吾受教皇圣下亚历山大六世之邀，应召赴宴，——恐彼或不满于吾捐衔所献之款，而望成为吾之继承人，则将——令吾与红衣主教凯普勒拉及宾铁伏格里奥归于——同一之命运（彼二人系被毒死者），吾今向吾之——惟一继承人，吾侄葛陀·斯帕达，宣布：吾曾在一彼所知——悉并曾与吾同往游览之地点（在基督山小岛之洞窟——中）埋藏吾所有之全部金银条，金块，宝石，钻石，美——玉；此项宝藏之存在仅吾一人知之，其总值约及罗马艾居二——百万；彼仅须打开鸟东小港右手第二十块岩——石，即可获得。此窟共有洞口二处；宝藏系在第二洞口最——深之一角；此项宝藏吾全部遗赠与吾之惟一继承人。 </p> 
<p>凯——撒十斯巴达 </p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p>一四九八年四月二十五日 </p> 
<p>“好，现在你明白了吧？”法利亚问道。 </p> 
<p>“这就是红衣主教斯帕达的声明，也就是人们找了那么久的遗嘱吗？”唐太斯问道，他心里依旧是半信半疑的。 </p> 
<p>“是呀！千真万确！” </p> 
<p>“谁把它补充成现在这个样子的？” </p> 
<p>“我，凭借那残余的半张。我把其余的部猜了出来，从那张纸的长度，测出句子的长短，再根据字面上的含义推敲出隐去的意思，就好象我们在岩洞里凭着顶上的一线微光摸路一样的把它摸索了出来。” </p> 
<p>“你得到这个结果以后又做了些什么呢？” </p> 
<p>“我决定马上出发，当时即刻就出发了，身边只带着我那本论统一意大利那篇巨著的前几章。但帝国的警务部长却早已在注意我了，他当时的意见恰巧和拿破仑相反，拿破仑是希望生一个儿子来统一意大利，而他却希望造成割据的局面。而我这样子行色匆匆，他们猜不出原因，就起了疑心，所以我刚一离开皮昂比诺就被捕了。现在，”法利亚以慈父般的表情对唐太斯继续说道，“现在，我的朋友，你知道得和我一样清楚了。假如我们能一起逃走，这个宝藏的一半就是你的了，假如我死在这儿，你一个人逃出去那么就全部归你了。” </p> 
<p>“可是，”唐太斯吞吞吐吐地问道，“这个宝藏除了我们以外，难道世界上就没有更合法的主人了吗？” </p> 
<p>“没有了，没有了这方面你放心好了，那个家族已经绝后了。再说，最后一代的斯帕达伯爵又指定我为他的继承人，把这本有象征意义的祈祷书遗赠给了我，他把这本书里所有的一切都遗赠了给我。不要紧，不要紧，放心好了，假如我们得到了这笔财富，我们大可问心无愧地享用它。” </p> 
<p>“你说这个宝藏价值——？” </p> 
<p>“两百万罗马艾居，照我们的钱算，约等于一千三百万埃居。” </p> 
<p>“不可能！”唐太斯被这个天文数字吓得叫出了声。 </p> 
<p>“不可能！为什么？”神甫问道。“斯巴达家族人是十五世纪最古老，最强盛的家族之一。而在当时，没有金融交易和工业，所以积攒那些金银珠宝并不为奇。就是在当今，也有些罗马家族几乎都快饿死了，可他们还有价值百万的钻石珠宝，那是当作传家之宝世代传下来的，他们是不能动用的。” </p> 
<p>爱德蒙仿费是在做梦，他时而怀疑，时而兴奋。 </p> 
<p>“我把这个秘密对你保守了这么久，”法利亚继续说道，“只是为了我要考验一下你这个人，然后让你吃一惊。要是在我的病没有再发作以前我们就逃了出去我会把你带到基督山岛去的，现在，”他长叹了一声，又说，“是要你带我到那儿去了。喂！唐太斯，你还没有谢谢我呢。” </p> 
<p>&nbsp;“这个宝藏是属于你的，我亲爱的朋友，”唐太斯答道，“而且只属于你一个人。我没有任何权利。我又不是你的亲人。” </p> 
<p>“你是我的儿子呀，唐太斯！”神甫喊道。“你是我囚禁生活中的儿子。我的职业决定了我只能过独身生活。上帝派你来抚慰我，来抚慰我这个不能做父亲的人和不能得到自由的囚徒。”说着法利亚就把他那条还能动的手臂向年轻人伸去后者扑上去抱住他的脖子，哭了起来。 </p>
