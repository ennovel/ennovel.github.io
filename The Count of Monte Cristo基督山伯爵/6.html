In this case, however, although the occasion of the entertainment was similar, the company was strikingly dissimilar. Instead of a rude mixture of sailors, soldiers, and those belonging to the humblest grade of life, the present assembly was composed of the very flower of Marseilles society,--magistrates who had resigned their office during the usurper's reign; officers who had deserted from the imperial army and joined forces with Condé; and younger members of families, brought up to hate and execrate the man whom five years of exile would convert into a martyr, and fifteen of restoration elevate to the rank of a god. </p> 
<p>The guests were still at table, and the heated and energetic conversation that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the South, where unhappily, for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party feeling. </p> 
<p>The emperor, now king of the petty Island of Elba, after having held sovereign sway over one-half of the world, counting as his subjects a small population of five or six thousand souls,--after having been accustomed to hear the "Vive Napoleons" of a hundred and twenty millions of human beings, uttered in ten different languages,--was looked upon here as a ruined man, separated forever from any fresh connection with France or claim to her throne. </p> 
<p>The magistrates freely discussed their political views; the military part of the company talked unreservedly of Moscow and Leipsic, while the women commented on the divorce of Josephine. It was not over the downfall of the man, but over the defeat of the Napoleonic idea, that they rejoiced, and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a revivified political existence. </p> 
<p>An old man, decorated with the cross of Saint Louis, now rose and proposed the health of King Louis XVIII. It was the Marquis de Saint-Méran. This toast, recalling at once the patient exile of Hartwell and the peace-loving King of France, excited universal enthusiasm; glasses were elevated in the air à l'Anglais, and the ladies, snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms, strewed the table with their floral treasures. In a word, an almost poetical fervor prevailed. </p> 
<p>"Ah," said the Marquise de Saint-Méran, a woman with a stern, forbidding eye, though still noble and distinguished in appearance, despite her fifty years--"ah, these revolutionists, who have driven us from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle during the Reign of Terror, would be compelled to own, were they here, that all true devotion was on our side, since we were content to follow the fortunes of a falling monarch, while they, on the contrary, made their fortune by worshipping the rising sun; yes, yes, they could not help admitting that the king, for whom we sacrificed rank, wealth, and station was truly our 'Louis the well-beloved,' while their wretched usurper his been, and ever will be, to them their evil genius, their 'Napoleon the accursed.' Am I not right, Villefort?" </p> 
<p>"I beg your pardon, madame. I really must pray you to excuse me, but--in truth--I was not attending to the conversation." </p> 
<p>"Marquise, marquise!" interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the toast, "let the young people alone; let me tell you, on one's wedding day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation than dry politics." </p> 
<p>"Never mind, dearest mother," said a young and lovely girl, with a profusion of light brown hair, and eyes that seemed to float in liquid crystal, "'tis all my fault for seizing upon M. de Villefort, so as to prevent his listening to what you said. But there--now take him--he is your own for as long as you like. M. Villefort, I beg to remind you my mother speaks to you." </p> 
<p>"If the marquise will deign to repeat the words I but imperfectly caught, I shall be delighted to answer," said M. de Villefort. </p> 
<p>"Never mind, Renée," replied the marquise, with a look of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features; but, however all other feelings may be withered in a woman's nature, there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart, and that is the shrine of maternal love. "I forgive you. What I was saying, Villefort, was, that the Bonapartists had not our sincerity, enthusiasm, or devotion." </p> 
<p>"They had, however, what supplied the place of those fine qualities," replied the young man, "and that was fanaticism. Napoleon is the Mahomet of the West, and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitions followers, not only as a leader and lawgiver, but also as the personification of equality." </p> 
<p>"He!" cried the marquise: "Napoleon the type of equality! For mercy's sake, then, what would you call Robespierre? Come, come, do not strip the latter of his just rights to bestow them on the Corsican, who, to my mind, has usurped quite enough." </p> 
<p>"Nay, madame; I would place each of these heroes on his right pedestal--that of Robespierre on his scaffold in the Place Louis Quinze; that of Napoleon on the column of the Place Vend?me. The only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these two men; one is the equality that elevates, the other is the equality that degrades; one brings a king within reach of the guillotine, the other elevates the people to a level with the throne. Observe," said Villefort, smiling, "I do not mean to deny that both these men were revolutionary scoundrels, and that the 9th Thermidor and the 4th of April, in the year 1814, were lucky days for France, worthy of being gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order; and that explains how it comes to pass that, fallen, as I trust he is forever, Napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites. Still, marquise, it has been so with other usurpers--Cromwell, for instance, who was not half so bad as Napoleon, had his partisans and advocates." </p> 
<p>"Do you know, Villefort, that you are talking in a most dreadfully revolutionary strain? But I excuse it, it is impossible to expect the son of a Girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven." A deep crimson suffused the countenance of Villefort. </p> 
<p>"'Tis true, madame," answered he, "that my father was a Girondin, but he was not among the number of those who voted for the king's death; he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the Reign of Terror, and had well-nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on which your father perished." </p> 
<p>"True," replied the marquise, without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up; "but bear in mind, if you please, that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which I may remark, that while my family remained among the stanchest adherents of the exiled princes, your father lost no time in joining the new government; and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin, the Count Noirtier became a senator." </p> 
<p>"Dear mother," interposed Renée, "you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside." </p> 
<p>"Suffer me, also, madame," replied Villefort, "to add my earnest request to Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran's, that you will kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past. What avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall? For my own part, I have laid aside even the name of my father, and altogether disown his political principles. He was--nay, probably may still be--a Bonapartist, and is called Noirtier; I, on the contrary, am a stanch royalist, and style myself de Villefort. Let what may remain of revolutionary sap exhaust itself and die away with the old trunk, and condescend only to regard the young shoot which has started up at a distance from the parent tree, without having the power, any more than the wish, to separate entirely from the stock from which it sprung." </p> 
<p>"Bravo, Villefort!" cried the marquis; "excellently well said! Come, now, I have hopes of obtaining what I have been for years endeavoring to persuade the marquise to promise; namely, a perfect amnesty and forgetfulness of the past." </p> 
<p>"With all my heart," replied the marquise; "let the past be forever forgotten. I promise you it affords me as little pleasure to revive it as it does you. All I ask is, that Villefort will be firm and inflexible for the future in his political principles. Remember, also, Villefort, that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your fealty and strict loyalty, and that at our recommendation the king consented to forget the past, as I do" (and here she extended to him her hand)--"as I now do at your entreaty. But bear in mind, that should there fall in your way any one guilty of conspiring against the government, you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with rigorous punishment, as it is known you belong to a suspected family." </p> 
<p>"Alas, madame," returned Villefort, "my profession, as well as the times in which we live, compels me to be severe. I have already successfully conducted several public prosecutions, and brought the offenders to merited punishment. But we have not done with the thing yet." </p> 
<p>"Do you, indeed, think so?" inquired the marquise. </p> 
<p>"I am, at least, fearful of it. Napoleon, in the Island of Elba, is too near France, and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans. Marseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one frivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists; from hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of persons, and assassinations in the lower." </p> 
<p>"You have heard, perhaps," said the Comte de Salvieux, one of M. de Saint-Méran's oldest friends, and chamberlain to the Comte d'Artois, "that the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence?" </p> 
<p>"Yes; they were talking about it when we left Paris," said M. de Saint-Méran; "and where is it decided to transfer him?" </p> 
<p>"To Saint Helena." </p> 
<p>"For heaven's sake, where is that?" asked the marquise. </p> 
<p>"An island situated on the other side of the equator, at least two thousand leagues from here," replied the count. </p> 
<p>"So much the better. As Villefort observes, it is a great act of folly to have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and Naples, of which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with Italy, the sovereignty of which he coveted for his son." </p> 
<p>"Unfortunately," said Villefort, "there are the treaties of 1814, and we cannot molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts." </p> 
<p>"Oh, well, we shall find some way out of it," responded M. de Salvieux. "There wasn't any trouble over treaties when it was a question of shooting the poor Duc d'Enghien." </p> 
<p>"Well," said the marquise, "it seems probable that, by the aid of the Holy Alliance, we shall be rid of Napoleon; and we must trust to the vigilance of M. de Villefort to purify Marseilles of his partisans. Tbe king is either a king or no king; if he be acknowledged as sovereign of France, he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity; and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at conspiracy--'tis the best and surest means of preventing mischief." </p> 
<p>"Unfortunately, madame," answered Villefort, "the strong arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken place." </p> 
<p>"Then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it." </p> 
<p>"Nay, madame, the law is frequently powerless to effect this; all it can do is to avenge the wrong done." </p> 
<p>"Oh, M. de Villefort," cried a beautiful young creature, daughter to the Comte de Salvieux, and the cherished friend of Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, "do try and get up some famous trial while we are at Marseilles. I never was in a law-court; I am told it is so very amusing!" </p> 
<p>"Amusing, certainly," replied the young man, "inasmuch as, instead of shedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at a theatre, you behold in a law-court a case of real and genuine distress--a drama of life. The prisoner whom you there see pale, agitated, and alarmed, instead of--as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedy--going home to sup peacefully with his family, and then retiring to rest, that he may recommence his mimic woes on the morrow,--is removed from your sight merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the executioner. I leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to bear you through such a scene. Of this, however, be assured, that should any favorable opportunity present itself, I will not fail to offer you the choice of being present." </p> 
<p>"For shame, M. de Villefort!" said Renée, becoming quite pale; "don't you see how you are frightening us?--and yet you laugh." </p> 
<p>"What would you have? 'Tis like a duel. I have already recorded sentence of death, five or six times, against the movers of political conspiracies, and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened, and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my heart?" </p> 
<p>"Gracious heavens, M. de Villefort," said Renée, becoming more and more terrified; "you surely are not in earnest." </p> 
<p>"Indeed I am," replied the young magistrate with a smile; "and in the interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness, the case would only be still more aggravated. Suppose, for instance, the prisoner, as is more than probable, to have served under Napoleon--well, can you expect for an instant, that one accustomed, at the word of his commander, to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe, will scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his personal enemy, than to slaughter his fellow-creatures, merely because bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey? Besides, one requires the excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused, in order to lash one's self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power. I would not choose to see the man against whom I pleaded smile, as though in mockery of my words. No; my pride is to see the accused pale, agitated, and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence." Renée uttered a smothered exclamation. </p> 
<p>"Bravo!" cried one of the guests; "that is what I call talking to some purpose." </p> 
<p>"Just the person we require at a time like the present," said a second. </p> 
<p>"What a splendid business that last case of yours was, my dear Villefort!" remarked a third; "I mean the trial of the man for murdering his father. Upon my word, you killed him ere the executioner had laid his hand upon him." </p> 
<p>"Oh, as for parricides, and such dreadful people as that," interposed Renée, "it matters very little what is done to them; but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues"-- </p> 
<p>"Why, that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit; for, don't you see, Renée, the king is the father of his people, and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the parent of thirty-two millions of souls, is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale?" </p> 
<p>"I don't know anything about that," replied Renée; "but, M. de Villefort, you have promised me--have you not?--always to show mercy to those I plead for." </p> 
<p>"Make yourself quite easy on that point," answered Villefort, with one of his sweetest smiles; "you and I will always consult upon our verdicts." </p> 
<p>"My love," said the marquise, "attend to your doves, your lap-dogs, and embroidery, but do not meddle with what you do not understand. Nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the badge of honor. There is a wise Latin proverb that is very much in point." </p> 
<p>"Cedant arma togae," said Villefort with a bow. </p> 
<p>"I cannot speak Latin," responded the marquise. </p> 
<p>"Well," said Renée, "I cannot help regretting you had not chosen some other profession than your own--a physician, for instance. Do you know I always felt a shudder at the idea of even a destroying angel?" </p> 
<p>"Dear, good Renée," whispered Villefort, as he gazed with unutterable tenderness on the lovely speaker. </p> 
<p>"Let us hope, my child," cried the marquis, "that M. de Villefort may prove the moral and political physician of this province; if so, he will have achieved a noble work." </p> 
<p>"And one which will go far to efface the recollection of his father's conduct," added the incorrigible marquise. </p> 
<p>"Madame," replied Villefort, with a mournful smile, "I have already had the honor to observe that my father has--at least, I hope so--abjured his past errors, and that he is, at the present moment, a firm and zealous friend to religion and order--a better royalist, possibly, than his son; for he has to atone for past dereliction, while I have no other impulse than warm, decided preference and conviction." Having made this well-turned speech, Villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect of his oratory, much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court. </p> 
<p>"Do you know, my dear Villefort," cried the Comte de Salvieux, "that is exactly what I myself said the other day at the Tuileries, when questioned by his majesty's principal chamberlain touching the singularity of an alliance between the son of a Girondin and the daughter of an officer of the Duc de Condé; and I assure you he seemed fully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences was based upon sound and excellent principles. Then the king, who, without our suspecting it, had overheard our conversation, interrupted us by saying, 'Villefort'--observe that the king did not pronounce the word Noirtier, but, on the contrary, placed considerable emphasis on that of Villefort--'Villefort,' said his majesty, 'is a young man of great judgment and discretion, who will be sure to make a figure in his profession; I like him much, and it gave me great pleasure to hear that he was about to become the son-in-law of the Marquis and Marquise de Saint-Méran. I should myself have recommended the match, had not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to it.'" </p> 
<p>"Is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to express himself so favorably of me?" asked the enraptured Villefort. </p> 
<p>"I give you his very words; and if the marquis chooses to be candid, he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to him, when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your espousing his daughter." </p> 
<p>"That is true," answered the marquis. </p> 
<p>"How much do I owe this gracious prince! What is there I would not do to evince my earnest gratitude!" </p> 
<p>"That is right," cried the marquise. "I love to see you thus. Now, then, were a conspirator to fall into your hands, he would be most welcome." </p> 
<p>"For my part, dear mother." interposed Renée, "I trust your wishes will not prosper, and that Providence will only permit petty offenders, poor debtors, and miserable cheats to fall into M. de Villefort's hands,--then I shall be contented." </p> 
<p>"Just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be called upon to prescribe for headaches, measles, and the stings of wasps, or any other slight affection of the epidermis. If you wish to see me the king's attorney, you must desire for me some of those violent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor redounds to the physician." </p> 
<p>At this moment, and as though the utterance of Villefort's wish had sufficed to effect its accomplishment, a servant entered the room, and whispered a few words in his ear. Villefort immediately rose from table and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business; he soon, however, returned, his whole face beaming with delight. Renée regarded him with fond affection; and certainly his handsome features, lit up as they then were with more than usual fire and animation, seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover. </p> 
<p>"You were wishing just now," said Villefort, addressing her, "that I were a doctor instead of a lawyer. Well, I at least resemble the disciples of Esculapius in one thing--that of not being able to call a day my own, not even that of my betrothal." </p> 
<p>"And wherefore were you called away just now?" asked Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, with an air of deep interest. </p> 
<p>"For a very serious matter, which bids fair to make work for the executioner." </p> 
<p>"How dreadful!" exclaimed Renée, turning pale. </p> 
<p>"Is it possible?" burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the magistrate to hear his words. </p> 
<p>"Why, if my information prove correct, a sort of Bonaparte conspiracy has just been discovered." </p> 
<p>"Can I believe my ears?" cried the marquise. </p> 
<p>"I will read you the letter containing the accusation, at least," said Villefort:-- </p> 
<p>"'The king's attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and the religions institutions of his country, that one named Edmond Dantès, mate of the ship Pharaon, this day arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been the bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper, and again taken charge of another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris. Ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above-mentioned Edmond Dantès, who either carries the letter for Paris about with him, or has it at his father's abode. Should it not be found in the possession of father or son, then it will assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said Dantès on board the Pharaon.'" </p> 
<p>"But," said Renée, "this letter, which, after all, is but an anonymous scrawl, is not even addressed to you, but to the king's attorney." </p> 
<p>"True; but that gentleman being absent, his secretary, by his orders, opened his letters; thinking this one of importance, he sent for me, but not finding me, took upon himself to give the necessary orders for arresting the accused party." </p> 
<p>"Then the guilty person is absolutely in custody?" said the marquise. </p> 
<p>"Nay, dear mother, say the accused person. You know we cannot yet pronounce him guilty." </p> 
<p>"He is in safe custody," answered Villefort; "and rely upon it, if the letter is found, he will not be likely to be trusted abroad again, unless he goes forth under the especial protection of the headsman." </p> 
<p>"And where is the unfortunate being?" asked Renée. </p> 
<p>"He is at my house." </p> 
<p>"Come, come, my friend," interrupted the marquise, "do not neglect your duty to linger with us. You are the king's servant, and must go wherever that service calls you." </p> 
<p>"O Villefort!" cried Renée, clasping her hands, and looking towards her lover with piteous earnestness, "be merciful on this the day of our betrothal." </p> 
<p>The young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair pleader sat, and leaning over her chair said tenderly,-- </p> 
<p>"To give you pleasure, my sweet Renée, I promise to show all the lenity in my power; but if the charges brought against this Bonapartist hero prove correct, why, then, you really must give me leave to order his head to be cut off." Renée shuddered. </p> 
<p>"Never mind that foolish girl, Villefort," said the marquise. "She will soon get over these things." So saying, Madame de Saint-Méran extended her dry bony hand to Villefort, who, while imprinting a son-in-law's respectful salute on it, looked at Renée, as much as to say, "I must try and fancy 'tis your dear hand I kiss, as it should have been." </p> 
<p>"These are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal," sighed poor Renée. </p> 
<p>"Upon my word, child!" exclaimed the angry marquise, "your folly exceeds all bounds. I should be glad to know what connection there can possibly be between your sickly sentimentality and the affairs of the state!" </p> 
<p>"O mother!" murmured Renée. </p>  
<p>差不多就在唐太斯举行婚宴的同一个时间里，大法院路上墨杜萨喷泉对面的一座宏大的贵族式的巨宅里，也正有人在设宴请吃订婚酒。但这儿的宾客可不是水手，士兵和那些头面人物下层平民百姓；团聚在这儿的都是马赛上流社会的头面人物，——文官曾在拿破仑统治的时期辞职退休；武官则从法军里开小差并投身于外国列强的军队里，而那些青年人则都在咒骂那个逆贼的环境中长大的，五年的流放的生活本该把这个人变成一个殉道者，而十五年的复辟生涯却使他被尊为半神的人。 </p> 
<p>宾客们围坐在餐桌前，席间的谈话热烈而紧张，谈话里充满了当时使南方居民们激昂复仇的情绪，法国南部曾经过五百年的宗教斗争，所以党派之间的对立的情绪极其激烈。 </p> 
<p>那个皇帝，曾一度统治过半个世界，并听惯了一亿二千万臣民用十种不同的语言高呼“拿破仑万岁！”现在却被贬为爱尔巴岛的国王，仅仅统治着五六千人；在餐桌边上这些人看来，他已经永远失去了法国，永远失去了他在法国的皇位了。 </p> 
<p>那些文官们滔滔不绝地讨论着他们的政治观点；武官们则在谈论莫斯科和来比锡战役，女人们则正在议论着约瑟芬皇后离婚的事。这一群保皇党人不但在庆祝一个人的垮台，而且还在庆祝一种主义的灭亡，他们相信政治上的繁荣已重新在他们眼前展现开来，他们已从痛苦的恶梦中醒来了。 </p> 
<p>一个佩戴着圣路易十字勋章的老人站了起来，他提议为国王路易十八的健康干杯。这位老人是圣梅朗侯爵。这一杯酒立刻使人联想到了在哈威尔的放逐生活和那爱好和平的法国国王，大家群情激昂，纷纷学英国人举杯祝贺的样子把酒杯举到了空中，太太小姐们则把挂在她们胸前的花束解开来散花女神般地把花撒了一桌。一时间，席上气氛热烈充满了诗意。 </p> 
<p>圣·梅朗侯爵夫人有着一对严厉而令人憎恶的眼睛，虽然是已有五十岁了但看上去仍有贵族气派，她说：“那些革命党人，他们不仅赶走我们，还抢走我们的财产，到后来在恐怖时期却只卖了一点点钱。他们如果在这儿，就不得不承认，真正的信仰还是站在我们这一边的，因为我们自愿追随一个没落的王朝的命运，而他们却恰恰相反，他们只知道对一个初升的朝阳顶礼膜拜，是的，是的，我们不得不承认：我们为之牺牲了官位财富的这位国王，才真正是我们‘万民爱戴的路易’，而他们那个篡权夺位者却永远只是个被人诅咒的‘该死的拿破仑’。我说的对不对，维尔福？” </p> 
<p>“您说什么，请您原谅，夫人。真的请您原谅，我刚才没留心听您在说什么。” </p> 
<p>“夫人，夫人！”刚才那个提议祝酒的老人插进来说，“别去打扰那些年青人吧，他们快要结婚了，当然他们要谈什么就去谈好了，只是自然不会去谈政治了。” </p> 
<p>“算了吧，我亲爱的妈妈，”一个年轻的美人说道，她长着浓密褐色头发，眼睛水灵灵顾盼如珍珠般闪亮，“这都怪我不好，是我刚才缠住了维尔福先生，以致使他没有听到您说的话。好了现在您跟他说吧，而且您爱谈多久就谈多久。维尔福先生，我请您注意，我母亲在跟您说话呢。” </p> 
<p>“如果侯爵夫人愿意把刚才的话再说一遍，我是非常乐于答复。”福尔维先生说。 </p> 
<p>“算了，蕾妮，我饶了你。”侯爵夫人说道，她那严厉死板的脸上露出一点温柔慈爱的神色。 </p> 
<p>女人总是这样的，其他的一切感情或许都会萎谢，但在母性的胸怀里，总有宽厚善良的一面，这是上帝特地给母爱留下的一席之地——“福尔维，我刚才说：拿破仑党分子丝毫没有我们那种真诚，热情和忠心。” </p> 
<p>“啊，夫人，他们倒也有代替这些品德的东西，”青年回答说，“那就是狂热。拿破仑是西方的穆罕默德，他的那些庸庸碌碌却又野心勃勃的信徒们很崇拜他，他们不仅把他看作一个领袖和立法者，还把他看作平民的化身。” </p> 
<p>“他！”侯爵夫人喊道，“拿破仑，平等的象征！天哪！那么，你把罗伯斯庇尔［罗伯斯庇尔（１７５８—１７９４）法国资产阶级革命时期时代雅各宾党的领袖，革命政府的首脑，在热月九日政变后，被处死。］又比做什么？算了，不要把后者头衔拿来去赐给那个科西嘉人［指拿破仑］了。我看，篡位的事已经够多的了。” </p> 
<p>“不，夫人，如果给这些英雄们树上纪念像的话，我要给他们每个人一个正确的地位——罗伯庇尔的应该树在他建立的断头台那个地方；拿破仑的则应该刻在旺多姆广场上的廊柱上。这两个人所代表的平等，其性质上是相反的，差别就在于——前一个是降低了平等，而后一个则是抬高了平等的地位。一个要把国王送上断头台，而另一个则要把人民抬高到王位上。请注意，”维尔福微着笑说，“我并不是在否认我刚才说的这两个人都是闹革命的混蛋，我承认热月九日［热月九日是罗伯斯庇尔等人被捕的日子。］和四月四日［这里指的是１８１４年４月初拿破仑退位被囚的日子］是法国并不幸运的两个日子，是值得王朝和文明社会的朋友们庆祝的日子，我想说的是，虽然我想信拿破仑已永远一蹶不振，但他却仍然拥有一批狂热的信徒。还有，侯爵夫人，其他那些大逆不道的人也都是这样的，——譬如说，克伦威尔吧［克伦威尔（１５９９—１６５８），英国政治家，资产阶级革命的领导人。］他虽然还不及拿破仑的一半，但他也有他的信徒。” </p> 
<p>“你知道不知道，维尔福，你满口都是革命党那种可怕的强辩，这一点我倒可以原谅，一个吉伦党徒［１８世纪法国资产阶级革命时期，代表大工商业资产阶级的政党，１７９２年后转向反对革命。］的儿子，难道会对恐怖保留一点兴趣。” </p> 
<p>维尔福的脸涨的通红，“不错，夫人，”他回答道，“我的父亲是一个吉伦特党党员，但他并没有去投票赞成处死国王。在恐怖时期，他也和您一样是一个受难者，也几乎和您的父亲一样在同一个断头台上被杀。” </p> 
<p>“不错，”侯爵夫人回答，这个被唤醒的悲惨的记忆丝毫没使她动容，“但我要请您记住，我们两家的父亲虽然同时被害，但他们各自的原因却是大相径庭的。为了证明这一点，我来把旧事重新提一遍：亲王［指路易十八］被流放的时候，我的家庭成员依旧是他忠诚的臣仆，而你的父亲却迫不及待的去投奔了新政府，公民瓦蒂成为吉伦特党以后，就摇身一变成了瓦蒂埃伯爵，并以上议员和政治家的姿态出现了。” </p> 
<p>“亲爱的妈妈，”蕾妮插进来说：“您是知道的，大家早已讲好了的，别再提这些讨厌的往事了。” </p> 
<p>“夫人，”维尔福说道，“我同意圣·梅明小姐的话，垦求您把过去忘了吧，这些陈年老账还翻它做什么？我本人不仅放弃了我父亲的政治主张，而且还抛弃了他的姓。他以前是——不，或许现在还是——一个拿破仑党人，他叫他的诺瓦蒂埃。我呢，相反，是一个忠诚的保皇党人，我姓我的维尔福。在一棵老树上还残余着点革命的液汁，就让它随着枯萎的老树干一起去干枯吧，至于那些新生的丫枝，它生长的地方离主干已隔开了一段距离，它很想和主干完全脱离关系，只是心有余而力不足罢了。” </p> 
<p>“好，维尔福！”侯爵叫道，“说得妙极了！这几年来，我总在劝侯爵夫人，忘掉过去的事情，但从未成功过，但愿你能替我说服她。” </p> 
<p>“好了，”侯爵夫人说道；“让我们永远忘记过去的事吧！这样再好不过了。至少，维尔福将来一定不会再动摇了。记住，维尔福，我们已用我们的身家性命向皇上为你作了担保，正因为如此，皇上才答应不追究过去（说到这里，她把她的手伸给他吻了一下），象我现在答应你的请求一样。你也要牢牢记祝要是有谁犯了颠覆政府罪而落到了你的手里，你可一定得严惩罪犯，因为大家都知道，你出身于一个可疑的家庭。” </p> 
<p>“嗨，夫人！”维尔福回答说，“我的职业，正象我们现在所处的这个时代一样，要求我不得不严厉的，我已经很顺利的处理了几次公诉，都使罪犯受了应得的惩罚。不幸的是，我们现在还没到万事大吉的时候。” </p> 
<p>“你真这样认为吗？”侯爵夫人问。 </p> 
<p>“恐怕是这样的。那在厄尔巴岛上的拿破仑，离法国仍然太近了，由于他近在咫尺，他的信徒们就会仍然抱有希望。马赛到处是些领了半饷休养的军官，他们每天尽为些鸡毛蒜皮的小事而借口和保皇党人吵架，所以上流社会中常常闹决斗，而下层社会中则时常闹暗杀。” </p> 
<p>“你或许也听说过吧？”萨尔维欧伯爵说。萨尔维欧伯爵是圣·梅朗侯爵老朋友之一，又是亚托士伯爵的侍从官。“听说神圣同盟想要移居他地呢。” </p> 
<p>“是的，我们离开巴黎的时候，他们正在研究这件事，”圣·梅朗侯爵说，“他们要把他移居到什么地方云呢？” </p> 
<p>“到圣赫勒拿岛。” </p> 
<p>“到圣·爱仑？那是个什么地方？”侯爵夫人问。 </p> 
<p>“是赤道那边的一个岛，离这儿有六千哩。”伯爵回答。 </p> 
<p>“那好极了！正如维尔福所说的，把这样一个人留在现在那个地方真是太蠢了，那儿一边靠近科西嘉——他出生的地方，一边靠近那勒斯——他妹夫在那儿做国王的地方，而对面就是意大利，他曾垂涎过那儿的主权，还想使他儿子做那儿的国王呢。” </p> 
<p>“不幸的是，”维尔福说，“我们被一八一四年的条约束缚着，除非破坏那些条约，否则我们是无法动一动拿破仑的。” </p> 
<p>“哼，那些条约迟早要被破坏，”萨尔维欧伯爵说，“不幸是德·昂甘公爵就是被他枪毙的，难道我们还要为他这样严守条约吗？” </p> 
<p>“嗯，”侯爵夫人说，“有神圣同盟的帮助，我们有可能除掉拿破仑，至于他在马赛的那些信徒，我们必须让维尔福先生来予以肃清。要做国王就得象一个国王，那样来统治不然就干脆不做国王，如果我们承认他是法国的最高统治者，就必须为他这个王国保持和平与安宁。而最好的办法就是任命一批忠贞不渝的大臣来平定每一次可能的暴乱，——这是防止出乱子的最好方法。” </p> 
<p>“夫人，”维尔福回答说，“不幸的是法律之手段虽强硬却无法做到防患于未然。” </p> 
<p>“那么，法律的工作只是来弥补祸患了。” </p> 
<p>“不，夫人，这一步法律也常常无力办到，它所能做的，只是惩戒既成的祸患而已。” </p> 
<p>“噢，维尔福先生！”一个美丽的年轻姑娘喊道，她是萨尔维欧伯爵的女儿，圣·梅朗小姐的密友，“您想想办法，我们还在马赛的时候办几件轰动的案子吧，我从来没到过法庭看审讯案子，我听说那儿非常有趣！” </p> 
<p>“有趣，当然罗，”青年答道，“比起在剧院里看杜撰的悲剧当然要有趣得多，在法院里，您所看到的案子是活生生的悲剧，——真正人生悲剧。您在那儿所看到的犯人，脸色苍白，焦急，惊恐，而当那场悲剧降下幕以后，他却无法回家平静地和他的家人共进晚餐，然后休息，准备明天再来重演一遍那悲哀的样子，他离开了您的视线以后，就被押回到了牢房里，被交给了刽子手。您自己来决定吧，看看您的神经能否受得了这样的场面。对这种事，请您放心，一旦有什么好机会，我一定不会忘了通知您，至于到场不到场，自然由您自己来决定。” </p> 
<p>蕾妮脸色苍白地说：“您难道没看见您把我们都吓成什么样了吗？您还笑呢。” </p> 
<p>“那你们想看到些什么？这是一种生死决斗。算起来，我已经判处过五六个政治犯和其他罪犯的死刑了，而谁能断定此刻又有多少正磨刀霍霍？伺机来对付我呢？” </p> 
<p>“我的天！维尔福先生，”蕾妮说，她已愈来愈害怕了，“您不是在开玩笑吧？” </p> 
<p>“我说的是真话，”年轻的法官面带微笑地回答说，“碰到有趣的审问，年轻的姑娘希望满足她的好奇心，而我是希望满足我的进取心，所以这种案件只会越审越严重。举个例子来说，在拿破仑手下的那些士兵——您能相信吗，他们习惯于听到命令就盲目地前冲去杀他从没见过的俄国人，奥地利人或匈牙利人，但当他们一旦知道了自己的私人仇敌以后，竟会畏畏缩缩地不敢用小刀刺进他的心脏？而且，这种事主要的是敌意在起作用，假如不是因为敌意，我们的职业就毫无意义了。 </p> 
<p>对我来说，当我看到被告眼中冒着怒火的时候，我就会觉得勇气倍增，精神亢奋。这已不再是一场诉讼，而是一场战斗。我攻击他，他反击我，我加倍地进攻，于是战斗就结束了，象所有的战斗一样，其结果不是胜就是败。整个诉讼过程就是这么一回事，其间的在于言辞争辩是否有利，如果被告嘲笑我说的话，我便想到，我一定是哪儿说的不好，我说的话一定苍白无力而不得当的。那么，您想，当一个检察官证实被告是有罪的，并看到被告在他的雄辩之下脸色苍白，低头认罪的时候，他会感到多么得意啊！那个低下的头不久就要被砍掉了——”蕾妮轻轻地叫了一声。 </p> 
<p>“好！”有一个来宾喊道，“这正是我所谓有意义的谈话。” </p> 
<p>“他正是目前我们所需要的人材。”第二个说。 </p> 
<p>“上次那件案子您办得漂亮极了，我亲爱的维尔福！”第三个说，“我是指那个谋杀生父的案子。说真的，他还没被交给刽子手之前，就已被您置于死地了。” </p> 
<p>“噢！说到那个东式父的逆子，对这种罪犯，什么惩罚都不过分的，”蕾妮插进来说道，“但对那些不幸的政治犯，他们惟一的罪名不就是参与政治阴谋——” </p> 
<p>“什么，那可是最大逆不道的罪名。难道您不明白吗，蕾妮，君为民父，凡是任何阴谋或计划想推翻或谋杀三千二百万人民之父的生命和安全的人，不就是一个更坏的弑父逆子吗？” </p> 
<p>“那种事我一点都不懂，”蕾妮回答，“可是，不管怎样维尔福先生，您已经答应过我——不是吗？——对那些我为他们求情的人，一定要从宽处理的。” </p> 
<p>“这一点您放心好了，”维尔福带着他甜蜜的微笑回答。 </p> 
<p>“对于最终的判决，我们一定来商量着办好了。” </p> 
<p>“宝贝，”侯爵夫人说，“你不要去照顾一下鸽子，你的小狗和刺绣吧，别来干预那些你根本不懂的事。这种年头，真是武事不修，文官得道，关于这一点，有一句拉丁话说得非常深刻。” </p> 
<p>“‘Ｃｅｄａｎｔａｒｍａｔｏｇ，’［拉丁文：不要武器，要长袍（即：偃武修文）］”维尔福微微欠身道。 </p> 
<p>“我不敢说拉丁语。”侯爵夫人说。 </p> 
<p>“嗯，”蕾妮说，“我真觉的有点儿遗憾，您为什么不选择另外一种职业——譬如说，做一个医生，杀人天使，虽然有天使之称，但在我看来似乎总是可怕的。” </p> 
<p>“亲爱的，好心的蕾妮！”维尔福低声说道温柔地看了一眼那可爱的姑娘。 </p> 
<p>“我的孩子，“侯爵大声说，“维尔福先生将成为本省道德上和政治上的医生，这是一种高尚的职业。” </p> 
<p>“而且可以洗刷掉他父亲的行为给人们种下的印象。”本性难移的侯爵夫人又接上一句。 </p> 
<p>“夫人，”维尔福苦笑着说道，“我很幸运地看到我父亲已经——至少我希望——公开承认了他过去的错误，他目前已是宗教和秩序的忠诚的朋友——一个或许比他的儿子还要好的保皇党，因为他是带着忏悔之情，而我只不过是凭着一腔热血罢了。”说完这篇斟字酌句演讲以后，维尔福环顾了一下四周，以观察他演说词的效果好象他此刻是在法庭上对旁听席讲话似的。 </p> 
<p>“好啊，我亲爱的维尔福，”萨尔维欧伯爵大声说道“您的话简直就象那次我在伊勒里宫讲的一样，那次御前大臣问我，他说一个吉伦特党徒的儿子同一个保皇党的女儿的联姻是否有点奇特，他很理解这种政治上化敌为友的主张，而且这正是国王的主张。想不到国王听到了我们的谈话，他插话说‘维尔福’——请注意。国王在这儿并没有叫‘诺瓦蒂埃’这个名字，相反的却很郑重地使用了‘维尔福’这个姓。国王说“‘维尔福’是一个极有判断能力，极小心细致的青年，他在他那一行一定会成为一个出人头地的人物，我很喜欢他，我很高兴听到他将要成为圣·梅朗侯爵夫妇的女婿。倘若不是他们先来求我同意这桩婚事的话，我自己本来也是这么想把这一对撮合起来的。” </p> 
<p>“陛下是那样说的吗，伯爵？”维尔福喜不自禁地问。 </p> 
<p>“我是照他的话说的，一个字也没改。如果侯爵愿意直言相告的话，他一定会承认，我所讲的这些和他六个月前去见陛下求他恩准和他女儿的婚事时陛下对他讲的话完全一致。” </p> 
<p>“是这样的，”侯爵回答说，“他说的是实情。” </p> 
<p>我对这位宽宏慈悲的国王是感恩载德！我将竭尽全力为国王效劳”。 </p> 
<p>“那太好了，”侯爵夫人大声说道，“我就喜欢你这个样子，现在，好了，如果现在一个谋反分子落在你的手里，我们可正等着他呢。” </p> 
<p>“我，啊，亲爱的妈妈”，蕾妮说。“我祈祷上帝请他不要听您的话，请他只让一些无足轻重的小犯人，穷苦的债务人，可怜的骗子落到维尔福先生的手里，那样我们晚上睡觉才能安稳。 </p> 
<p>“那还不是一回事”维尔福大笑着说，“您就等于祈求只许一个医生治头痛，麻疹，蜂蜇，或一些轻微病症一样，您希望我当检察官的话，您就应该给我来一些疑难病症的病人，这样才能显出我这个医生医术高明呀。” </p> 
<p>正在这时，象是维尔福的愿望一说出口就能达到似的，一个仆人走了进来，在他的耳边低声说了些什么，维尔福立刻站起来离开了席位，说有要事待办，就走了出去，但一会他又回来了，满脸洋溢着喜悦的神色。蕾妮含情脉脉地望着他，她钦慕凝视着她那温雅聪明的爱人，当然了，他有漂亮的仪容，眼睛里闪耀着非凡的热情奋发的光芒，这些正是她爱慕的。 </p> 
<p>您刚才希望我去做一个医生”维尔福对她说道“好吧，同希腊神医埃斯科拉庇的教条相比我致少有一点是大同小异的，就是没有哪一天可以说是属于我自己的，即使是在我订婚的这一天。” </p> 
<p>“刚才又要叫你到哪儿去？”圣·梅朗小姐微微带着不安的神色问。 </p> 
<p>“唉！假如我听到的话是真的，哪么现在就有一个病人，已危在旦夕了，这种病很严重，已经病得行将就木了。” </p> 
<p>“多可怕呀！”蕾妮惊叫了起来，她本来因激动而变得发红的面颊变得煞白。 </p> 
<p>“真有这么一会事？”在座的宾客们异口同声地惊喊了起来。 </p> 
<p>“噢，如果我得到的消息确凿的话，刚才我们又发现一次拿破仑党的阴谋活动。” </p> 
<p>“这次可能是真的吗？”侯爵夫人喊到。 </p> 
<p>“请让我来把这封密信念给你们听吧。”维尔福说“‘敝人系拥护王室及教会之人士，兹向您报告，有爱德蒙·唐太斯其人，系法老号之大副，今晨自士麦拿经那不勒斯抵埠，中途曾停靠费拉约港。此人受缪拉之命送信与逆贼，并受逆贼之命送信与巴黎拿破仑党委员会。犯罪证据在将其逮捕时即可获得，该信件不是在其身上，就是在其父家中，或者在法老号上他的船舱里。’” </p> 
<p>“可是，”蕾妮说，“这必竟只是一封乱写的匿名信，况且又不是写给你的，这是写给检察官的。” </p> 
<p>“不错，检察官不在，他的秘书便受命拆开看了这封信。他认为这事很重要，遂派人来找我，又因找不到我。他就自己下了逮捕令，把那人抓了起来。” </p> 
<p>“这么说那个罪犯已被逮捕了，是吗？”侯爵夫人说。 </p> 
<p>“这应该说是被告。”蕾妮说。 </p> 
<p>“已经被捕了，”维尔福回答说，“正如我们刚才有幸向蕾妮小姐说过的那样，假如那封关键的信找到了，那个病人可就没救了。” </p> 
<p>“那个不幸的人在哪儿？”蕾妮问。 </p> 
<p>“他在我们家里。” </p> 
<p>“快去吧，我的朋友，”侯爵夫人插进来说，“别因为和我们呆在一起而疏忽了你的职责。你是国王的臣仆，职务所在，不论哪儿都得去。” </p> 
<p>“噢，维尔福先生！”蕾妮紧握着他的双手喊道，“今天是我们订婚的日子，你可要对那人宽大一点啊！”那青年绕过桌子，走到那美丽的姑娘身边，靠在她的椅子上，温柔地说：“为了让您高兴，我亲爱的蕾妮，在我力所能及的范围内，我答应您尽量宽大些。但假如证据确凿的话，您就必须同意，我下命令把他杀头。” </p> 
<p>蕾妮一听到最后两个字便痉挛似的震颤了一下，把头转向了一边，好象她那温柔的天性受不了如此冷酷，说要把一个活生生的人杀掉似的。 </p> 
<p>“别听那傻姑娘唠叨了，维尔福，”侯爵夫人说，“她不久就会听惯这些事情的。”说着，圣·梅朗夫人就把她那瘦骨嶙嶙的手伸给了维尔福，他一边吻，一边望着蕾妮，他的眼睛似乎在对她说，“我亲爱的此刻我吻的是您的手；或至少我希望如此。” </p> 
<p>“这些都是不祥之兆！”可怜的蕾妮叹息道。 </p> 
<p>“说真的，孩子！”侯爵夫人愤愤地说，“你真是太傻，太孩子气了。我倒想知道，你这种讨厌的怪脾气和国家大事究竟有什么关系！” </p> 
<p>“啊，妈妈！”蕾妮低声埋怨地说。 </p> 
<p>“夫人，我求您饶恕她这一次小小的错误吧，”维尔福说，“我答应您，我一定尽我的职责，对罪犯严惩不贷。”但当法官的维尔福在向侯爵夫人说这番话的时候，做情人的维尔福却向未婚妻丢了个眼色，他的目光说：“放心吧，蕾妮，为了您的爱，我会从宽处理的。”蕾妮以她最甜蜜的温柔的微笑回报了他那一眼，于是维尔福就满怀着无比幸福走了出去。 </p>
