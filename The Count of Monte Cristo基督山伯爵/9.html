<p>"What ails you, baron?" he exclaimed. "You appear quite aghast. Has your uneasiness anything to do with what M. de Blacas has told me, and M. de Villefort has just confirmed?" M. de Blacas moved suddenly towards the baron, but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of the statesman; and besides, as matters were, it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of police should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect. </p> 
<p>"Sire"--stammered the baron. </p> 
<p>"Well, what is it?" asked Louis XVIII. The minister of police, giving way to an impulse of despair, was about to throw himself at the feet of Louis XVIII., who retreated a step and frowned. </p> 
<p>"Will you speak?" he said. </p> 
<p>"Oh, sire, what a dreadful misfortune! I am, indeed, to be pitied. I can never forgive myself!" </p> 
<p>"Monsieur," said Louis XVIII, "I command you to speak." </p> 
<p>"Well, sire, the usurper left Elba on the 26th February, and landed on the 1st of March." </p> 
<p>"And where? In Italy?" asked the king eagerly. </p> 
<p>"In France, sire,--at a small port, near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan." "The usurper landed in France, near Antibes, in the Gulf of Juan, two hundred and fifty leagues from Paris, on the 1st of March, and you only acquired this information to-day, the 4th of March! Well, sir, what you tell me is impossible. You must have received a false report, or you have gone mad." </p> 
<p>"Alas, sire, it is but too true!" Louis made a gesture of indescribable anger and alarm, and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had struck him at the same moment in heart and countenance. </p> 
<p>"In France!" he cried, "the usurper in France! Then they did not watch over this man. Who knows? they were, perhaps, in league with him." </p> 
<p>"Oh, sire," exclaimed the Duc de Blacas, "M. Dandré is not a man to be accused of treason! Sire, we have all been blind, and the minister of police has shared the general blindness, that is all." </p> 
<p>"But"--said Villefort, and then suddenly checking himself, he was silent; then he continued, "Your pardon, sire," he said, bowing, "my zeal carried me away. Will your majesty deign to excuse me?" </p> 
<p>"Speak, sir, speak boldly," replied Louis. "You alone forewarned us of the evil; now try and aid us with the remedy." </p> 
<p>"Sire," said Villefort, "the usurper is detested in the south; and it seems to me that if he ventured into the south, it would be easy to raise Languedoc and Provence against him." </p> 
<p>"Yes, assuredly," replied the minister; "but he is advancing by Gap and Sisteron." </p> 
<p>"Advancing--he is advancing!" said Louis XVIII. "Is he then advancing on Paris?" The minister of police maintained a silence which was equivalent to a complete avowal. </p> 
<p>"And Dauphiné, sir?" inquired the king, of Villefort. "Do you think it possible to rouse that as well as Provence?" </p> 
<p>"Sire, I am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel fact; but the feeling in Dauphiné is quite the reverse of that in Provence or Languedoc. The mountaineers are Bonapartists, sire." </p> 
<p>"Then," murmured Louis, "he was well informed. And how many men had he with him?" </p> 
<p>"I do not know, sire," answered the minister of police. </p> 
<p>"What, you do not know! Have you neglected to obtain information on that point? Of course it is of no consequence," he added, with a withering smile. </p> 
<p>"Sire, it was impossible to learn; the despatch simply stated the fact of the landing and the route taken by the usurper." </p> 
<p>"And how did this despatch reach you?" inquired the king. The minister bowed his head, and while a deep color overspread his cheeks, he stammered out,-- </p> 
<p>"By the telegraph, sire."--Louis XVIII. advanced a step, and folded his arms over his chest as Napoleon would have done. </p> 
<p>"So then," he exclaimed, turning pale with anger, "seven conjoined and allied armies overthrew that man. A miracle of heaven replaced me on the throne of my fathers after five-and-twenty years of exile. I have, during those five-and-twenty years, spared no pains to understand the people of France and the interests which were confided to me; and now, when I see the fruition of my wishes almost within reach, the power I hold in my hands bursts, and shatters me to atoms!" </p> 
<p>"Sire, it is fatality!" murmured the minister, feeling that the pressure of circumstances, however light a thing to destiny, was too much for any human strength to endure. </p> 
<p>"What our enemies say of us is then true. We have learnt nothing, forgotten nothing! If I were betrayed as he was, I would console myself; but to be in the midst of persons elevated by myself to places of honor, who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves,--for my fortune is theirs--before me they were nothing--after me they will be nothing, and perish miserably from incapacity--ineptitude! Oh, yes, sir, you are right--it is fatality!" </p> 
<p>The minister quailed before this outburst of sarcasm. M. de Blacas wiped the moisture from his brow. Villefort smiled within himself, for he felt his increased importance. </p> 
<p>"To fall," continued King Louis, who at the first glance had sounded the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspended,--"to fall, and learn of that fall by telegraph! Oh, I would rather mount the scaffold of my brother, Louis XVI., than thus descend the staircase at the Tuileries driven away by ridicule. Ridicule, sir--why, you know not its power in France, and yet you ought to know it!" </p> 
<p>"Sire, sire," murmured the minister, "for pity's"-- </p> 
<p>"Approach, M. de Villefort," resumed the king, addressing the young man, who, motionless and breathless, was listening to a conversation on which depended the destiny of a kingdom. "Approach, and tell monsieur that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known." </p> 
<p>"Sire, it was really impossible to learn secrets which that man concealed from all the world." </p> 
<p>"Really impossible! Yes--that is a great word, sir. Unfortunately, there are great words, as there are great men; I have measured them. Really impossible for a minister who has an office, agents, spies, and fifteen hundred thousand francs for secret service money, to know what is going on at sixty leagues from the coast of France! Well, then, see, here is a gentleman who had none of these resources at his disposal--a gentleman, only a simple magistrate, who learned more than you with all your police, and who would have saved my crown, if, like you, he had the power of directing a telegraph." The look of the minister of police was turned with concentrated spite on Villefort, who bent his head in modest triumph. </p> 
<p>"I do not mean that for you, Blacas," continued Louis XVIII.; "for if you have discovered nothing, at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your suspicions. Any other than yourself would have considered the disclosure of M. de Villefort insignificant, or else dictated by venal ambition," These words were an allusion to the sentiments which the minister of police had uttered with so much confidence an hour before. </p> 
<p>Villefort understood the king's intent. Any other person would, perhaps, have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise; but he feared to make for himself a mortal enemy of the police minister, although he saw that Dandré was irrevocably lost. In fact, the minister, who, in the plenitude of his power, had been unable to unearth Napoleon's secret, might in despair at his own downfall interrogate Dantès and so lay bare the motives of Villefort's plot. Realizing this, Villefort came to the rescue of the crest-fallen minister, instead of aiding to crush him. </p> 
<p>"Sire," said Villefort, "the suddenness of this event must prove to your majesty that the issue is in the hands of Providence; what your majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing to chance, and I have profited by that chance, like a good and devoted servant--that's all. Do not attribute to me more than I deserve, sire, that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first opinion you have been pleased to form of me." The minister of police thanked the young man by an eloquent look, and Villefort understood that he had succeeded in his design; that is to say, that without forfeiting the gratitude of the king, he had made a friend of one on whom, in case of necessity, he might rely. </p> 
<p>"'Tis well," resumed the king. "And now, gentlemen," he continued, turning towards M. de Blacas and the minister of police, "I have no further occasion for you, and you may retire; what now remains to do is in the department of the minister of war." </p> 
<p>"Fortunately, sire," said M. de Blacas, "we can rely on the army; your majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and attachment." </p> 
<p>"Do not mention reports, duke, to me, for I know now what confidence to place in them. Yet, speaking of reports, baron, what have you learned with regard to the affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques?" </p> 
<p>"The affair in the Rue Saint-Jacques!" exclaimed Villefort, unable to repress an exclamation. Then, suddenly pausing, he added, "Your pardon, sire, but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget, not the respect I have, for that is too deeply engraved in my heart, but the rules of etiquette." </p> 
<p>"Go on, go on, sir," replied the king; "you have to-day earned the right to make inquiries here." </p> 
<p>"Sire," interposed the minister of police, "I came a moment ago to give your majesty fresh information which I had obtained on this head, when your majesty's attention was attracted by the terrible event that has occurred in the gulf, and now these facts will cease to interest your majesty." </p> 
<p>"On the contrary, sir,--on the contrary," said Louis XVIII., "this affair seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our attention, and the death of General Quesnel will, perhaps, put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy." At the name of General Quesnel, Villefort trembled. </p> 
<p>"Everything points to the conclusion, sire," said the minister of police, "that death was not the result of suicide, as we first believed, but of assassination. General Quesnel, it appears, had just left a Bonapartist club when he disappeared. An unknown person had been with him that morning, and made an appointment with him in the Rue Saint-Jacques; unfortunately, the general's valet, who was dressing his hair at the moment when the stranger entered, heard the street mentioned, but did not catch the number." As the police minister related this to the king, Villefort, who looked as if his very life hung on the speaker's lips, turned alternately red and pale. The king looked towards him. </p> 
<p>"Do you not think with me, M. de Villefort, that General Quesnel, whom they believed attached to the usurper, but who was really entirely devoted to me, has perished the victim of a Bonapartist ambush?" </p> 
<p>"It is probable, sire," replied Villefort. "But is this all that is known?" </p> 
<p>"They are on the track of the man who appointed the meeting with him." </p> 
<p>"On his track?" said Villefort. </p> 
<p>"Yes, the servant has given his description. He is a man of from fifty to fifty-two years of age, dark, with black eyes covered with shaggy eyebrows, and a thick mustache. He was dressed in a blue frock-coat, buttoned up to the chin, and wore at his button-hole the rosette of an officer of the Legion of Honor. Yesterday a person exactly corresponding with this description was followed, but he was lost sight of at the corner of the Rue de la Jussienne and the Rue Coq-Héron." Villefort leaned on the back of an arm-chair, for as the minister of police went on speaking he felt his legs bend under him; but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him, he breathed again. </p> 
<p>"Continue to seek for this man, sir," said the king to the minister of police; "for if, as I am all but convinced, General Quesnel, who would have been so useful to us at this moment, has been murdered, his assassins, Bonapartists or not, shall be cruelly punished." It required all Villefort's coolness not to betray the terror with which this declaration of the king inspired him. </p> 
<p>"How strange," continued the king, with some asperity; "the police think that they have disposed of the whole matter when they say, 'A murder has been committed,' and especially so when they can add, 'And we are on the track of the guilty persons.'" </p> 
<p>"Sire, your majesty will, I trust, be amply satisfied on this point at least." </p> 
<p>"We shall see. I will no longer detain you, M. de Villefort, for you must be fatigued after so long a journey; go and rest. Of course you stopped at your father's?" A feeling of faintness came over Villefort. </p> 
<p>"No, sire," he replied, "I alighted at the Hotel de Madrid, in the Rue de Tournon." </p> 
<p>"But you have seen him?" </p> 
<p>"Sire, I went straight to the Duc de Blacas." </p> 
<p>"But you will see him, then?" </p> 
<p>"I think not, sire." </p> 
<p>"Ah, I forgot," said Louis, smiling in a manner which proved that all these questions were not made without a motive; "I forgot you and M. Noirtier are not on the best terms possible, and that is another sacrifice made to the royal cause, and for which you should be recompensed." </p> 
<p>"Sire, the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that I have nothing more to ask for." </p> 
<p>"Never mind, sir, we will not forget you; make your mind easy. In the meanwhile" (the king here detached the cross of the Legion of Honor which he usually wore over his blue coat, near the cross of St. Louis, above the order of Notre-Dame-du-Mont-Carmel and St. Lazare, and gave it to Villefort)--"in the meanwhile take this cross." </p> 
<p>"Sire," said Villefort, "your majesty mistakes; this is an officer's cross." </p> 
<p>"Ma foi," said Louis XVIII., "take it, such as it is, for I have not the time to procure you another. Blacas, let it be your care to see that the brevet is made out and sent to M. de Villefort." Villefort's eyes were filled with tears of joy and pride; he took the cross and kissed it. </p> 
<p>"And now," he said, "may I inquire what are the orders with which your majesty deigns to honor me?" </p> 
<p>"Take what rest you require, and remember that if you are not able to serve me here in Paris, you may be of the greatest service to me at Marseilles." </p> 
<p>"Sire," replied Villefort, bowing, "in an hour I shall have quitted Paris." </p> 
<p>"Go, sir," said the king; "and should I forget you (kings' memories are short), do not be afraid to bring yourself to my recollection. Baron, send for the minister of war. Blacas, remain." </p> 
<p>"Ah, sir," said the minister of police to Villefort, as they left the Tuileries, "you entered by luck's door--your fortune is made." </p> 
<p>"Will it be long first?" muttered Villefort, saluting the minister, whose career was ended, and looking about him for a hackney-coach. One passed at the moment, which he hailed; he gave his address to the driver, and springing in, threw himself on the seat, and gave loose to dreams of ambition. </p> 
<p>Ten minutes afterwards Villefort reached his hotel, ordered horses to be ready in two hours, and asked to have his breakfast brought to him. He was about to begin his repast when the sound of the bell rang sharp and loud. The valet opened the door, and Villefort heard some one speak his name. </p> 
<p>"Who could know that I was here already?" said the young man. The valet entered. </p> 
<p>"Well," said Villefort, "what is it?--Who rang?--Who asked for me?" </p> 
<p>"A stranger who will not send in his name." </p> 
<p>"A stranger who will not send in his name! What can he want with me?" </p> 
<p>"He wishes to speak to you." </p> 
<p>"To me?" </p> 
<p>"Yes." </p> 
<p>"Did he mention my name?" </p> 
<p>"Yes." </p> 
<p>"What sort of person is he?" </p> 
<p>"Why, sir, a man of about fifty." </p> 
<p>"Short or tall?" </p> 
<p>"About your own height, sir." </p> 
<p>"Dark or fair?" </p> 
<p>"Dark,--very dark; with black eyes, black hair, black eyebrows." </p> 
<p>"And how dressed?" asked Villefort quickly. </p> 
<p>"In a blue frock-coat, buttoned up close, decorated with the Legion of Honor." </p> 
<p>"It is he!" said Villefort, turning pale. </p> 
<p>"Eh, " said the individual whose description we have twice given, entering the door, "what a great deal of ceremony! Is it the custom in Marseilles for sons to keep their fathers waiting in their anterooms?" </p> 
<p>"Father!" cried Villefort, "then I was not deceived; I felt sure it must be you." </p> 
<p>"Well, then, if you felt so sure," replied the new-comer, putting his cane in a corner and his hat on a chair, "allow me to say, my dear Gérard, that it was not very filial of you to keep me waiting at the door." </p> 
<p>"Leave us, Germain," said Villefort. The servant quitted the apartment with evident signs of astonishment. </p>  
<p>“出什么事了，男爵先生？”他惊讶地问，“看来你好象是一副大难临头的样子，你这惊慌犹豫的样子，是否与刚才勃拉卡斯先生又加以证实的事有关？” </p> 
<p>勃拉卡斯公爵赶紧向男爵走去，那大臣的惊慌的神色完全吓退了这位元老的得意心情，说实在的，在这种情况下，如果是警务大臣战胜了他，实在是比使大臣受到羞辱对他有利得多。 </p> 
<p>“陛下，”——男爵嚅嚅地说。 </p> 
<p>“什么事？”路易十八问。那绝望几乎压倒了警务大臣，几乎是扑到了国王的脚下，后者不由得倒退了几步，并皱起了眉头。 </p> 
<p>“请您快说呀。”他说。 </p> 
<p>“噢，陛下，灾难降临了，我真该死，我永远也不能饶恕我自己！” </p> 
<p>“先生我命令你快说。”路易十八说道。 </p> 
<p>“陛下，逆贼已在二月十八日离开了厄尔巴岛，三月一日登陆了。” </p> 
<p>“在那儿？——在意大利吗？”国王问。 </p> 
<p>“在法国，陛下，昂蒂布附近一个小巷口的琪恩湾那儿。” </p> 
<p>“那逆贼于三月一日在离巴黎七百五十哩的琪恩湾昂布附近登陆，而今天都三月四日了你才得到消息！哦，先生，你告诉我的事是难以叫人想象的，如果不是你得到了一份假情报，那么你就是发疯了。” </p> 
<p>“唉，陛下，这事千真万确！” </p> 
<p>国王做了一个难以形容的，愤怒和惊惶的动作，然后猛地一下子挺直并站了起来，象是这个突然的打击同时击中了他的脸和心一样。“在法国，”他喊到，“这个逆贼已经到了法国了！这么说，他们没有看住这个人，谁知道？或许他们是和他串通的！” </p> 
<p>“噢，陛下！”勃拉卡斯公爵惊喊到，这事决不该怪罪唐德雷说他不忠。陛下，我们都瞎了眼，警务大臣也同大家一样仅此而已。” </p> 
<p>“但是，”——维尔福刚刚说了两个字，便又突然停住了。 </p> 
<p>“请您原谅，陛下，”他一面说一面欠了一下身子，我的忠诚已使我无法自制了。望陛下宽恕。” </p> 
<p>“说吧，先生，大胆地说吧，”国王说道。“看来只有你一个人把这个坏消息及早告诉了我们，现在请你帮助我们找到什么补救的办法！” </p> 
<p>“陛下，”维尔福说：“逆贼在南方是遭人憎恨的，假如他想在那儿冒险，我们就很容易发动郎格多克和普罗旺斯两省的民众起来反对他。” </p> 
<p>“那是当然”，大臣说道，只不过是顺着加普和锡斯特龙挺进。 </p> 
<p>“挺进，他在挺进！”路易十八说。“这么说他是在向巴黎挺进了吗？” </p> 
<p>警务大臣一声不响了，这无疑是一种默认。 </p> 
<p>“陀菲内省呢，先生？”国王问维尔福，“你觉得我们也可能象在普罗旺斯省那样去做吗？” </p> 
<p>“陛下，我很抱歉不得不禀告陛下一个严酷的事实，陀菲内的民情远不如普罗旺斯或朗格多克。那些山民都是拿破仑党分子，陛下。” </p> 
<p>“那么，路易十八喃喃地说，“他的情报倒很正确了，他带了多少人？” </p> 
<p>“我不知道。陛下。警务大臣说。 </p> 
<p>“什么！你不知道，你没去打听打听这方面的消息？是啊，这件事没什么了不起，”他说着苦笑了一下。 </p> 
<p>“陛下，这是没法知道的，快报上只提到了登陆和逆贼所走的路线。” </p> 
<p>“你这个快报是怎么来的？” </p> 
<p>大臣低下了头，涨红了脸，他喃喃地说，“快报是投递站接力送来的，陛下。” </p> 
<p>路易十八向前跨了一步，象拿破仑那样交叉起双臂。“哦，这么说七国联军推翻了那个人，在我经过了二十五年的流亡以后，上天显出奇迹，又把我送到了我父亲的宝座上。在这二十五年中，我研究，探索，分析我的国家和人民和事物，而今正当我全部心愿就要实现的时候，我手里的权力却爆炸了，把我炸得粉碎！” </p> 
<p>“陛下这是劫数！”大臣轻声地说，他觉得这样的一种压力，在命运之神看来不论多么微不足道，却已经能够压跨一个人了。 </p> 
<p>“那么，我们的敌人抨击我们说的话没错了，什么都没有学到，什么都不会忘记！假如我也象他那样为国家所共弃，那我倒可以自慰，既然是大家推荐我为尊，他们大家就应该爱护我胜过爱护他们自己才是。因为我的荣辱也就是他们的荣辱，在我继位之前，他们是一无所有的，在我逊位之后，他们也将一无所有，我竟会因他们的愚昧和无能而自取灭亡！噢，是的，先生，你说的不错——这是劫数！” </p> 
<p>在这一番冷嘲热讽之下，大臣一直躬着腰，不敢抬头。勃拉卡斯德公爵一个劲地擦着他头上的冷汗。只有维尔福暗自得意，因为他觉得他越发显得重要了。 </p> 
<p>“亡国！”国王路易又说，他一眼就看出了国王将要坠入的深渊——。“亡国，从快报上才知道亡国的消息！噢，我情愿踏上我哥哥路易十六的断头台而不愿意这样丑态百出地被人赶下杜伊勒宫的楼梯。笑话呀，你为什么不知道他在法国的力量，而这原是你应该知道的！” </p> 
<p>“陛下，陛下，”大臣咕哝地说，“陛下开恩——” </p> 
<p>“请您过来，维尔福先生，”国王又对那青年说道，后者一动也不动，屏住了呼吸，倾听一场关系到一个国王的命运的谈话，——“来来，告诉大臣先生，他所不知道的一切，别人却能事先知道。” </p> 
<p>“陛下，那个人一手遮盖住了天下人的耳目，谁也无法事先知道这个计划。” </p> 
<p>“无法知道，这是多么伟大的字眼，不幸的是我已经都知道了，天下确实有伟大的字眼，先生，一位大臣他手里有庞大的机关，有警察，有秘探，有一百五十万法朗的秘密活动经费，竟无法说出离法国一百八十里以外的情况。难道真的无法知道，那么，看看吧，这儿有一位先生，他的手下并没有这些条件，只是一个法官，可他却比你和所有警务都知道的多。假如，他象你那样有权指挥快报机构的话，他早就可以帮我保住这顶皇冠啦。” </p> 
<p>警务大臣的眼光都转到维尔福身上，神色中带着仇恨，后者却带着胜利的谦逊低下了头。 </p> 
<p>“我并没有在说您，勃拉卡斯，”路易十八继续说道，“因为算是您没有发现什么，但至少您很明达，曾坚持您的怀疑，要是换了个人，就会认为维尔福先生的发现是无足轻重的，或他只是想贪功邀赏罢了。” </p> 
<p>这些话是射向警务大臣一小时前带着极为自信的口气所发的那番议论的，维尔福很明白国王讲话的意图。要是换了别人，也许被这一番赞誉所陶醉，而忘乎所以了，但他怕自己会成为警务大臣的死敌，他已看出大臣的失败是无可挽回的了。 </p> 
<p>事情也确实如此，这位大臣的权力在握的时候虽不能揭穿拿破仑的秘密，但在他垂死挣扎之际，却可能揭穿他的秘密，因为他只要问一问唐太斯便一切都明白了，所以维尔福不得不落井下石，反而来帮他一把了。 </p> 
<p>“陛下，”维尔福说，事态变化之迅速足以向陛下证明：只有上帝掀起一阵风暴才能把它止祝陛下誉臣有先见之明，实际上我纯粹是出于偶然，我只不过象一个忠心的臣仆那样抓住了这个偶然的机会而已。陛下，请不要对我过奖了，否则，我将来恐怕再无机会来附和您的好意了。” </p> 
<p>警务大臣向这位青年人投去了感激的一瞥，维尔福明白他的计划已经成功了，也就是说他既没有损害了国王的感激之情，又新交上了一个朋友，必要时，也许可以依靠他呢。 </p> 
<p>“那也好，”国王又开始说道，“先生们，”他转过向勃拉卡斯公爵和警务大臣说道，“我对你们没有什么可以谈的了，你们可以退下了。剩下的事必须由陆军部来办理了。” </p> 
<p>“幸亏，陛下，”勃拉卡斯说，“我们可以信赖陆军，陛下知道。所有的报告都证实他们是忠心耿耿的。” </p> 
<p>“先生，别再向我提起报告了！我现在已经知道可以信赖他们的程度了，可是，说到报告，男爵阁下，你知道有关圣·杰克司事件的消息吗？” </p> 
<p>“圣·杰克司街的事件！”维尔福禁不住惊叫了一声。然后，又急忙换了口气说，“请您原谅，陛下，我对陛下的忠诚使我忘记了——倒不是忘记了对您的尊敬，而是一时忘记了礼仪。” </p> 
<p>“请随意一些，先生！”国王答道，“今天你有提出问题的权利。” </p> 
<p>“陛下，”警务大臣回答道，“我刚才就是来向陛下报告有关这方面的最新消息的，碰巧陛下的注意力都集中到那件可怕的大事上去了，现在陛下恐怕不会再感兴趣了吧。” </p> 
<p>“恰恰相反，先生，恰恰相反，”路易十八说，“依我看和刚才我们所关心的事一定有关系，奎斯奈尔将军之死或许会引起一次内部的大叛乱。” </p> 
<p>维尔福听到奎斯奈尔将军的名字不禁颤粟了一下。 </p> 
<p>“陛下，”警务大臣说，“事实上，一切证据都说明这他的死，并不象我们以前所相信的那样是自杀，而是一次谋杀。好象是奎斯奈尔将军在离开一个拿破仑党俱乐部的时候失踪的。那天早晨，曾有人和他在一起，并约他在圣·杰克司街相会，不幸的是当那个陌生人进来的时候，将军的贴身保镖正在梳头，他只听到了街名，没听清门牌号码。” </p> 
<p>当警务大臣向国王讲述这件事的时候，维尔福全神贯注地听着，脸上一阵红一阵白，好象他的整个生命都维系于这番话上似的。国王把目光转到了他的身上。 </p> 
<p>“维尔福先生，人们都以为这位奎斯奈尔将军是追随逆贼的，但实际上他却是完全忠心于我的，我觉得他是拿破仑党所设的一次圈套的牺牲品，你是否与我有同感？” </p> 
<p>“这是可能的，陛下，”维尔福回答。“但现在只知道这些吗？” </p> 
<p>“他们已经在跟踪那个和他约会的人了。” </p> 
<p>“已经跟踪他了吗？”维尔福说。 </p> 
<p>“是的，仆人已把他的外貌描绘了出来。他是一个年约五十一二岁的人，棕褐色皮肤，蓬松的眉毛底下有一双黑色的眼睛，胡子又长又密。他身穿蓝色披风，钮孔上挂着荣誉团军官的玫瑰花形徽章。昨天跟踪到一个人，他的外貌和以上所描过的完全相符，但那人到裘森尼街和高海隆路的拐角上便突然不见了。” </p> 
<p>维尔福将身子靠在了椅背上，因为警务大臣在讲述的时候，他直觉得两腿发软，当他听到那人摆脱了跟踪他的密探的时候，他才松了一口气。 </p> 
<p>“继续追踪这个人，先生，”国王对警务大臣说，“奎斯尔将军目前对我们非常有用，从各方面看来，我相信他是被谋杀的，假如果真如此，那么暗杀他的凶手，不论是否是拿破仑党，都该从严惩处。” </p> 
<p>国王讲这些话的，维尔福在极力使自己镇定下来，以免露出恐怖的神色。 </p> 
<p>“多妙呀！”国王用很尖酸的语气继续说道。“当警务部说‘又发生了一起谋杀案’的时候，尤其是，当他们又加上一句‘我们已经在追踪凶手’的时候，他们就以为一切就都已了结。” </p> 
<p>“陛下，我相信陛下对此已经满意了。” </p> 
<p>“等着瞧吧。我不再耽搁你了，男爵。维尔福先生，你经过这次长途旅程，一定很疲乏了，回去休息吧。你大概是下塌在你父亲那儿吧？” </p> 
<p>维尔福感到微微有点昏眩。“不，陛下，”他答道，“我下塌在导农街的马德里饭店里。” </p> 
<p>“你去见过他了吗？” </p> 
<p>“陛下，我刚到就去找勃拉卡斯公爵先生了。” </p> 
<p>“但你总得去见他吧？” </p> 
<p>“我不想去见他，陛下。” </p> 
<p>“呀，我忘啦，”路易十八说道，随即微笑了一下，借以表示这一切问题是没有任何意图的，“我忘记了你和诺瓦莱埃先生的关系并不太好，这又是效忠王室而作出的一次牺牲，为了两次牺牲你该得到报偿。” </p> 
<p>“陛下，陛下对我的仁慈已超过了我所希望的最高报偿，我已别无所求了。” </p> 
<p>“那算什么，先生，我们是不会忘记你的，你放心好了。现在（说到这里，国王将他佩戴在蓝色上衣上的荣誉勋章摘了下来，递给了维尔福，这枚勋章原先戴在他的圣·路易十字勋章的旁边。圣·拉柴勋章之上的）——现在暂时先接受这个勋章吧。” </p> 
<p>“陛下，”维尔福说，“陛下搞错了，这种勋章是军人佩戴的。” </p> 
<p>“是啊！”路易十八说，“拿着吧，就算这样吧，因为我来不及给你弄个别的了。勃拉卡斯，您记得把荣誉勋位证书发给维尔福先生。” </p> 
<p>维尔福的眼睛里充满了喜悦和得意的泪水。他接过勋章在上面吻了一下。“现在，”他说，“我能问一下：陛下还有什么命令赐我去执行吗？” </p> 
<p>“你需要休息，先休息去吧，要记住，你虽然不能在巴黎这儿为我服务，但你在马赛对我也是很有用处呢。” </p> 
<p>“陛下，”维尔福一面鞠躬，一面回答，“我在一个钟头之内就要离开巴黎了。” </p> 
<p>“去吧，先生，”国王说，“假如我忘了你（国王记忆力都不强），就设法使我想起你来，不用怕。男爵先生，去叫军政大臣来。勃拉卡斯，你留在这儿。” </p> 
<p>“啊，先生，”在他们离开杜伊勒里宫的时候，警务部长对维尔福说，“您走的门路不错，您的前程远大！”“谁知道能否真的前程远大？”维尔福心里这样思忖着，一面向大臣致敬告别，他的任务已经完成了，他环顾四周寻找出租的马车。这时正巧有一辆从眼前经过，他便喊住了它，告诉了地址，然后跳到车里，躺在座位上，做起野心梦来了。 </p> 
<p>十分钟之后，维尔福到了他的旅馆，他吩咐马车两小时后来接他，并吩咐把早餐给他拿来。他正要进餐时，门铃有了，听那铃声，便知道这人果断有力。仆人打开了门，维尔福听到来客提到了他的名字。 </p> 
<p>“谁会知道我在这儿呢？”青年自问道。 </p> 
<p>仆人走进来。 </p> 
<p>“咦，”维尔福说，“什么事？谁拉铃？谁要见我？” </p> 
<p>“一个陌生人，他不愿意说出他的姓名。” </p> 
<p>“一个不愿意说出姓名的陌生人，他想干什么？” </p> 
<p>“他想同您说话。” </p> 
<p>“同我。” </p> 
<p>“是的。” </p> 
<p>“他有没有说出我的名字？” </p> 
<p>“说了。” </p> 
<p>“他是个什么样的人。” </p> 
<p>“唔，先生，是一个五十岁左右的人。” </p> 
<p>“个头是高是矮？” </p> 
<p>“跟您差不多，先生。” </p> 
<p>“头发是黑的还是黄的？” </p> 
<p>“黑，——黑极了，黑眼睛，黑头发，黑眉毛。” </p> 
<p>“穿什么衣服？”维尔福急忙问。 </p> 
<p>“穿一件蓝色的披风，排胸扣的，还挂着荣誉勋章。” </p> 
<p>“是他！”维尔福说道，脸色变得苍白。 </p> 
<p>“呃，一点不错！”我们已描绘过两次外貌的那个人走进门来说，“规矩还不少哪！儿子叫他父亲候在外客厅里，这可是马赛的规矩吗？” </p> 
<p>“父亲！”维尔福喊道，“我没弄错，我觉得这一定是您。” </p> 
<p>“哦，那么，假如你觉得这样肯定，”来客一面说着，一面把他的手杖靠在了一个角落里，把帽子放在了一张椅子上，“让我告诉你，我亲爱的杰拉尔，你要我这样等在门外可太不客气了。” </p> 
<p>“你去吧，茄曼。”维尔福说。于是那仆人带着一脸的惊异神色退出了房间。</p>
