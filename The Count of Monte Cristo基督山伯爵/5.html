<p>Danglars, however, who now made his appearance, accompanied by Caderousse, effectually confirmed the report, stating that he had recently conversed with M. Morrel, who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at La Rèserve. </p> 
<p>In fact, a moment later M. Morrel appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the Pharaon, who hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in command of the ship; and as Dantès was universally beloved on board his vessel, the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own. </p> 
<p>With the entrance of M. Morrel, Danglars and Caderousse were despatched in search of the bride-groom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a lively sensation, and to beseech him to make haste. </p> 
<p>Danglars and Caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed; but ere they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them, composed of the betrothed pair, a party of young girls in attendance on the bride, by whose side walked Dantès' father; the whole brought up by Fernand, whose lips wore their usual sinister smile. </p> 
<p>Neither Mercédès nor Edmond observed the strange expression of his countenance; they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the presence of each other. </p> 
<p>Having acquitted themselves of their errand, and exchanged a hearty shake of the hand with Edmond, Danglars and Caderousse took their places beside Fernand and old Dantès,--the latter of whom attracted universal notice. The old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk, trimmed with steel buttons, beautifully cut and polished. His thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings, evidently of English manufacture, while from his three-cornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons. Thus he came along, supporting himself on a curiously carved stick, his aged countenance lit up with happiness, looking for all the world like one of the aged dandies of 1796, parading the newly opened gardens of the Tuileries and Luxembourg. Beside him glided Caderousse, whose desire to partake of the good things provided for the wedding-party had induced him to become reconciled to the Dantès, father and son, although there still lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of the preceding night; just as the brain retains on waking in the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream. </p> 
<p>As Danglars approached the disappointed lover, he cast on him a look of deep meaning, while Fernand, as he slowly paced behind the happy pair, who seemed, in their own unmixed content, to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed, was pale and abstracted; occasionally, however, a deep flush would overspread his countenance, and a nervous contraction distort his features, while, with an agitated and restless gaze, he would glance in the direction of Marseilles, like one who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important event. </p> 
<p>Dantès himself was simply, but becomingly, clad in the dress peculiar to the merchant service--a costume somewhat between a military and a civil garb; and with his fine countenance, radiant with joy and happiness, a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined. </p> 
<p>Lovely as the Greek girls of Cyprus or Chios, Mercédès boasted the same bright flashing eyes of jet, and ripe, round, coral lips. She moved with the light, free step of an Arlesienne or an Andalusian. One more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil, or, at least, have cast down her thickly fringed lashes, so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes; but, on the contrary, the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say: "If you are my friends, rejoice with me, for I am very happy." </p> 
<p>As soon as the bridal party came in sight of La Rèserve, M. Morrel descended and came forth to meet it, followed by the soldiers and sailors there assembled, to whom he had repeated the promise already given, that Dantès should be the successor to the late Captain Leclere. Edmond, at the approach of his patron, respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride within that of M. Morrel, who, forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared, was gayly followed by the guests, beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several minutes. </p> 
<p>"Father," said Mercédès, stopping when she had reached the centre of the table, "sit, I pray you, on my right hand; on my left I will place him who has ever been as a brother to me," pointing with a soft and gentle smile to Fernand; but her words and look seemed to inflict the direst torture on him, for his lips became ghastly pale, and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart. </p> 
<p>During this time, Dantès, at the opposite side of the table, had been occupied in similarly placing his most honored guests. M. Morrel was seated at his right hand, Danglars at his left; while, at a sign from Edmond, the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most agreeable. </p> 
<p>Then they began to pass around the dusky, piquant, Arlesian sausages, and lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses, prawns of large size and brilliant color, the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel within, the clovis, esteemed by the epicures of the South as more than rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster,--all the delicacies, in fact, that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach, and styled by the grateful fishermen "fruits of the sea." </p> 
<p>"A pretty silence truly!" said the old father of the bride-groom, as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz, and which had just been placed before Mercédès herself. "Now, would anybody think that this room contained a happy, merry party, who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away?" </p> 
<p>"Ah," sighed Caderousse, "a man cannot always feel happy because he is about to be married." </p> 
<p>"The truth is," replied Dantès, "that I am too happy for noisy mirth; if that is what you meant by your observation, my worthy friend, you are right; joy takes a strange effect at times, it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow." </p> 
<p>Danglars looked towards Fernand, whose excitable nature received and betrayed each fresh impression. </p> 
<p>"Why, what ails you?" asked he of Edmond. "Do you fear any approaching evil? I should say that you were the happiest man alive at this instant." </p> 
<p>"And that is the very thing that alarms me," returned Dantès. "Man does not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed; happiness is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood, where fierce, fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach; and monsters of all shapes and kinds, requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours. I own that I am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which I feel myself unworthy--that of being the husband of Mercédès." </p> 
<p>"Nay, nay!" cried Caderousse, smiling, "you have not attained that honor yet. Mercédès is not yet your wife. Just assume the tone and manner of a husband, and see how she will remind you that your hour is not yet come!" </p> 
<p>The bride blushed, while Fernand, restless and uneasy, seemed to start at every fresh sound, and from time to time wiped away the large drops of perspiration that gathered on his brow. </p> 
<p>"Well, never mind that, neighbor Caderousse; it is not worth while to contradict me for such a trifle as that. 'Tis true that Mercédès is not actually my wife; but," added he, drawing out his watch, "in an hour and a half she will be." </p> 
<p>A general exclamation of surprise ran round the table, with the exception of the elder Dantès, whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his large white teeth. Mercédès looked pleased and gratified, while Fernand grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch. </p> 
<p>"In an hour?" inquired Danglars, turning pale. "How is that, my friend?" </p> 
<p>"Why, thus it is," replied Dantès. "Thanks to the influence of M. Morrel, to whom, next to my father, I owe every blessing I enjoy, every difficulty his been removed. We have purchased permission to waive the usual delay; and at half-past two o'clock the mayor of Marseilles will be waiting for us at the city hall. Now, as a quarter-past one has already struck, I do not consider I have asserted too much in saying, that, in another hour and thirty minutes Mercédès will have become Madame Dantès." </p> 
<p>Fernand closed his eyes, a burning sensation passed across his brow, and he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his falling from his chair; but in spite of all his efforts, he could not refrain from uttering a deep groan, which, however, was lost amid the noisy felicitations of the company. </p> 
<p>"Upon my word," cried the old man, "you make short work of this kind of affair. Arrived here only yesterday morning, and married to-day at three o'clock! Commend me to a sailor for going the quick way to work!" </p> 
<p>"But," asked Danglars, in a timid tone, "how did you manage about the other formalities--the contract--the settlement?" </p> 
<p>"The contract," answered Dantès, laughingly, "it didn't take long to fix that. Mercédès has no fortune; I have none to settle on her. So, you see, our papers were quickly written out, and certainly do not come very expensive." This joke elicited a fresh burst of applause. </p> 
<p>"So that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out to be the actual wedding dinner!" said Danglars. </p> 
<p>"No, no," answered Dantès; "don't imagine I am going to put you off in that shabby manner. To-morrow morning I start for Paris; four days to go, and the same to return, with one day to discharge the commission intrusted to me, is all the time I shall be absent. I shall be back here by the first of March, and on the second I give my real marriage feast." </p> 
<p>This prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to such a degree, that the elder Dantès, who, at the commencement of the repast, had commented upon the silence that prevailed, now found it difficult, amid the general din of voices, to obtain a moment's tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bride-groom. </p> 
<p>Dantès, perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father, responded by a look of grateful pleasure; while Mercédès glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to Edmond. </p> 
<p>Around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social position not to feel the trammels of etiquette. Such as at the commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according to their inclination rose unceremoniously, and sought out more agreeable companions. Everybody talked at once, without waiting for a reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own thoughts. </p> 
<p>Fernand's paleness appeared to have communicated itself to Danglars. As for Fernand himself, he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned; unable to rest, he was among the first to quit the table, and, as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening sounds, he continued, in utter silence, to pace the farther end of the salon. </p> 
<p>Caderousse approached him just as Danglars, whom Fernand seemed most anxious to avoid, had joined him in a corner of the room. </p> 
<p>"Upon my word," said Caderousse, from whose mind the friendly treatment of Dantès, united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken of, had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at Dantès' good fortune,--"upon my word, Dantès is a downright good fellow, and when I see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be. I cannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have served him that trick you were planning yesterday." </p> 
<p>"Oh, there was no harm meant," answered Danglars; "at first I certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what Fernand might be tempted to do; but when I saw how completely he had mastered his feelings, even so far as to become one of his rival's attendants, I knew there was no further cause for apprehension." Caderousse looked full at Fernand--he was ghastly pale. </p> 
<p>"Certainly," continued Danglars, "the sacrifice was no trifling one, when the beauty of the bride is concerned. Upon my soul, that future captain of mine is a lucky dog! Gad, I only wish he would let me take his place." </p> 
<p>"Shall we not set forth?" asked the sweet, silvery voice of Mercédès; "two o'clock has just struck, and you know we are expected in a quarter of an hour." </p> 
<p>"To be sure!--to be sure!" cried Dantès, eagerly quitting the table; "let us go directly!" </p> 
<p>His words were re-echoed by the whole party, with vociferous cheers. </p> 
<p>At this moment Danglars, who had been incessantly observing every change in Fernand's look and manner, saw him stagger and fall back, with an almost convulsive spasm, against a seat placed near one of the open windows. At the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on the stairs, followed by the measured tread of soldiery, with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements; then came a hum and buzz as of many voices, so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party, among whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk, and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed. </p> 
<p>The sounds drew nearer. Three blows were struck upon the panel of the door. The company looked at each other in consternation. </p> 
<p>"I demand admittance," said a loud voice outside the room, "in the name of the law!" As no attempt was made to prevent it, the door was opened, and a magistrate, wearing his official scarf, presented himself, followed by four soldiers and a corporal. Uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present. </p> 
<p>"May I venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit?" said M. Morrel, addressing the magistrate, whom he evidently knew; "there is doubtless some mistake easily explained." </p> 
<p>"If it be so," replied the magistrate, "rely upon every reparation being made; meanwhile, I am the bearer of an order of arrest, and although I most reluctantly perform the task assigned me, it must, nevertheless, be fulfilled. Who among the persons here assembled answers to the name of Edmond Dantès?" Every eye was turned towards the young man who, spite of the agitation he could not but feel, advanced with dignity, and said, in a firm voice, "I am he; what is your pleasure with me?" </p> 
<p>"Edmond Dantès," replied the magistrate, "I arrest you in the name of the law!" </p> 
<p>"Me!" repeated Edmond, slightly changing color, "and wherefore, I pray?" </p> 
<p>"I cannot inform you, but you will be duly acquainted with the reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary examination." </p> 
<p>M. Morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless. He saw before him an officer delegated to enforce the law, and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked with his official scarf, as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy. Old Dantès, however, sprang forward. There are situations which the heart of a father or a mother cannot be made to understand. He prayed and supplicated in terms so moving, that even the officer was touched, and, although firm in his duty, he kindly said, "My worthy friend, let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions. Your son has probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo, and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given the information required, whether touching the health of his crew, or the value of his freight." </p> 
<p>"What is the meaning of all this?" inquired Caderousse, frowningly, of Danglars, who had assumed an air of utter surprise. </p> 
<p>"How can I tell you?" replied he; "I am, like yourself, utterly bewildered at all that is going on, and cannot in the least make out what it is about." Caderousse then looked around for Fernand, but he had disappeared. </p> 
<p>The scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling clearness. The painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the evening before had raised between himself and his memory. </p> 
<p>"So, so," said he, in a hoarse and choking voice, to Danglars, "this, then, I suppose, is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday? All I can say is, that if it be so, 'tis an ill turn, and well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it." </p> 
<p>"Nonsense," returned Danglars, "I tell you again I have nothing whatever to do with it; besides, you know very well that I tore the paper to pieces." </p> 
<p>"No, you did not!" answered Caderousse, "you merely threw it by--I saw it lying in a corner." </p> 
<p>"Hold your tongue, you fool!--what should you know about it?--why, you were drunk!" </p> 
<p>"Where is Fernand?" inquired Caderousse. </p> 
<p>"How do I know?" replied Danglars; "gone, as every prudent man ought to be, to look after his own affairs, most likely. Never mind where he is, let you and I go and see what is to be done for our poor friends." </p> 
<p>During this conversation, Dantès, after having exchanged a cheerful shake of the hand with all his sympathizing friends, had surrendered himself to the officer sent to arrest him, merely saying, "Make yourselves quite easy, my good fellows, there is some little mistake to clear up, that's all, depend upon it; and very likely I may not have to go so far as the prison to effect that." </p> 
<p>"Oh, to be sure!" responded Danglars, who had now approached the group, "nothing more than a mistake, I feel quite certain." </p> 
<p>Dantès descended the staircase, preceded by the magistrate, and followed by the soldiers. A carriage awaited him at the door; he got in, followed by two soldiers and the magistrate, and the vehicle drove off towards Marseilles. </p> 
<p>"Adieu, adieu, dearest Edmond!" cried Mercédès, stretching out her arms to him from the balcony. </p> 
<p>The prisoner heard the cry, which sounded like the sob of a broken heart, and leaning from the coach he called out, "Good-by, Mercédès--we shall soon meet again!" Then the vehicle disappeared round one of the turnings of Fort Saint Nicholas. </p> 
<p>"Wait for me here, all of you!" cried M. Morrel; "I will take the first conveyance I find, and hurry to Marseilles, whence I will bring you word how all is going on." </p> 
<p>"That's right!" exclaimed a multitude of voices, "go, and return as quickly as you can!" </p> 
<p>This second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind. The old father and Mercédès remained for some time apart, each absorbed in grief; but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes, and with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each other's arms. </p> 
<p>Meanwhile Fernand made his appearance, poured out for himself a glass of water with a trembling hand; then hastily swallowing it, went to sit down at the first vacant place, and this was, by mere chance, placed next to the seat on which poor Mercédès had fallen half fainting, when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old Dantès. Instinctively Fernand drew back his chair. </p> 
<p>"He is the cause of all this misery--I am quite sure of it," whispered Caderousse, who had never taken his eyes off Fernand, to Danglars. </p> 
<p>"I don't think so," answered the other; he's too stupid to imagine such a scheme. I only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever wrought it." </p> 
<p>"You don't mention those who aided and abetted the deed," said Caderousse. </p> 
<p>"Surely," answered Danglars, "one cannot be held responsible for every chance arrow shot into the air." </p> 
<p>"You can, indeed, when the arrow lights point downward on somebody's head." </p> 
<p>Meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different form. </p> 
<p>"What think you, Danglars," said one of the party, turning towards him, "of this event?" </p> 
<p>"Why," replied he, "I think it just possible Dantès may have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered here as contraband." </p> 
<p>"But how could he have done so without your knowledge, Danglars, since you are the ship's supercargo?" </p> 
<p>"Why, as for that, I could only know what I was told respecting the merchandise with which the vessel was laden. I know she was loaded with cotton, and that she took in her freight at Alexandria from Pastret's warehouse, and at Smyrna from Pascal's; that is all I was obliged to know, and I beg I may not be asked for any further particulars." </p> 
<p>"Now I recollect," said the afflicted old father; "my poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee, and another of tobacco for me!" </p> 
<p>"There, you see," exclaimed Danglars. "Now the mischief is out; depend upon it the custom-house people went rummaging about the ship in our absence, and discovered poor Dantès' hidden treasures." </p> 
<p>Mercédès, however, paid no heed to this explanation of her lover's arrest. Her grief, which she had hitherto tried to restrain, now burst out in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing. </p> 
<p>"Come, come," said the old man, "be comforted, my poor child; there is still hope!" </p> 
<p>"Hope!" repeated Danglars. </p> 
<p>"Hope!" faintly murmured Fernand, but the word seemed to die away on his pale agitated lips, and a convulsive spasm passed over his countenance. </p> 
<p>"Good news! good news!" shouted forth one of the party stationed in the balcony on the lookout. "Here comes M. Morrel back. No doubt, now, we shall hear that our friend is released!" </p> 
<p>Mercédès and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the door. He was very pale. </p> 
<p>"What news?" exclaimed a general burst of voices. </p> 
<p>"Alas, my friends," replied M. Morrel, with a mournful shake of his head, "the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than I expected." </p> 
<p>"Oh, indeed--indeed, sir, he is innocent!" sobbed forth Mercédès. </p> 
<p>"That I believe!" answered M. Morrel; "but still he is charged"-- </p> 
<p>"With what?" inquired the elder Dantès. </p> 
<p>"With being an agent of the Bonapartist faction!" Many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our story is dated. </p> 
<p>A despairing cry escaped the pale lips of Mercédès; the old man sank into a chair. </p> 
<p>"Ah, Danglars!" whispered Caderousse, "you have deceived me--the trick you spoke of last night has been played; but I cannot suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault. I am determined to tell them all about it." </p> 
<p>"Be silent, you simpleton!" cried Danglars, grasping him by the arm, "or I will not answer even for your own safety. Who can tell whether Dantès be innocent or guilty? The vessel did touch at Elba, where he quitted it, and passed a whole day in the island. Now, should any letters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon him, will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his accomplices?" </p> 
<p>With the rapid instinct of selfishness, Caderousse readily perceived the solidity of this mode of reasoning; he gazed, doubtfully, wistfully, on Danglars, and then caution supplanted generosity. </p> 
<p>"Suppose we wait a while, and see what comes of it," said he, casting a bewildered look on his companion. </p> 
<p>"To be sure!" answered Danglars. "Let us wait, by all means. If he be innocent, of course he will be set at liberty; if guilty, why, it is no use involving ourselves in a conspiracy." </p> 
<p>"Let us go, then. I cannot stay here any longer." "With all my heart!" replied Danglars, pleased to find the other so tractable. "Let us take ourselves out of the way, and leave things for the present to take their course." </p> 
<p>After their departure, Fernand, who had now again become the friend and protector of Mercédès, led the girl to her home, while the friends of Dantès conducted the now half-fainting man back to his abode. </p> 
<p>The rumor of Edmond arrest as a Bonapartist agent was not slow in circulating throughout the city. </p> 
<p>"Could you ever have credited such a thing, my dear Danglars?" asked M. Morrel, as, on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh tidings of Dantès, from M. de Villefort, the assistant procureur, he overtook his supercargo and Caderousse. "Could you have believed such a thing possible?" </p> 
<p>"Why, you know I told you," replied Danglars, "that I considered the circumstance of his having anchored at the Island of Elba as a very suspicious circumstance." </p> 
<p>"And did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself?" </p> 
<p>"Certainly not!" returned Danglars. Then added in a low whisper, "You understand that, on account of your uncle, M. Policar Morrel, who served under the other government, and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject, you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of Napoleon. I should have feared to injure both Edmond and yourself, had I divulged my own apprehensions to a soul. I am too well aware that though a subordinate, like myself, is bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs, there are many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else." </p> 
<p>"'Tis well, Danglars--'tis well!" replied M. Morrel. "You are a worthy fellow; and I had already thought of your interests in the event of poor Edmond having become captain of the Pharaon." </p> 
<p>"Is it possible you were so kind?" </p> 
<p>"Yes, indeed; I had previously inquired of Dantès what was his opinion of you, and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post, for somehow I have perceived a sort of coolness between you." </p> 
<p>"And what was his reply?" </p> 
<p>"That he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which he merely referred to without entering into particulars, but that whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ship's owner would have his preference also." </p> 
<p>"The hypocrite!" murmured Danglars. </p> 
<p>"Poor Dantès!" said Caderousse. "No one can deny his being a noble-hearted young fellow." </p> 
<p>"But meanwhile," continued M. Morrel, "here is the Pharaon without a captain." </p> 
<p>"Oh," replied Danglars, "since we cannot leave this port for the next three months, let us hope that ere the expiration of that period Dantès will be set at liberty." </p> 
<p>"No doubt; but in the meantime?" </p> 
<p>"I am entirely at your service, M. Morrel," answered Danglars. "You know that I am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced captain in the service; and it will be so far advantageous to you to accept my services, that upon Edmond's release from prison no further change will be requisite on board the Pharaon than for Dantès and myself each to resume our respective posts." </p> 
<p>"Thanks, Danglars--that will smooth over all difficulties. I fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the Pharaon, and look carefully to the unloading of her freight. Private misfortunes must never be allowed to interfere with business." </p> 
<p>"Be easy on that score, M. Morrel; but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor Edmond?" </p> 
<p>"I will let you know that directly I have seen M. de Villefort, whom I shall endeavor to interest in Edmond's favor. I am aware he is a furious royalist; but, in spite of that, and of his being king's attorney, he is a man like ourselves, and I fancy not a bad sort of one." </p> 
<p>"Perhaps not," replied Danglars; "but I hear that he is ambitions, and that's rather against him." </p> 
<p>"Well, well," returned M. Morrel, "we shall see. But now hasten on board, I will join you there ere long." So saying, the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies, and proceeded in the direction of the Palais de Justice. </p> 
<p>"You see," said Danglars, addressing Caderousse, "the turn things have taken. Do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence?" </p> 
<p>"Not the slightest, but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere joke should lead to such consequences." </p> 
<p>"But who perpetrated that joke, let me ask? neither you nor myself, but Fernand; you knew very well that I threw the paper into a corner of the room--indeed, I fancied I had destroyed it." </p> 
<p>"Oh, no," replied Caderousse, "that I can answer for, you did not. I only wish I could see it now as plainly as I saw it lying all crushed and crumpled in a corner of the arbor." </p> 
<p>"Well, then, if you did, depend upon it, Fernand picked it up, and either copied it or caused it to be copied; perhaps, even, he did not take the trouble of recopying it. And now I think of it, by Heavens, he may have sent the letter itself! Fortunately, for me, the handwriting was disguised." </p> 
<p>"Then you were aware of Dantès being engaged in a conspiracy?" </p> 
<p>"Not I. As I before said, I thought the whole thing was a joke, nothing more. It seems, however, that I have unconsciously stumbled upon the truth." </p> 
<p>"Still," argued Caderousse, "I would give a great deal if nothing of the kind had happened; or, at least, that I had had no hand in it. You will see, Danglars, that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us." </p> 
<p>"Nonsense! If any harm come of it, it should fall on the guilty person; and that, you know, is Fernand. How can we be implicated in any way? All we have got to do is, to keep our own counsel, and remain perfectly quiet, not breathing a word to any living soul; and you will see that the storm will pass away without in the least affecting us." </p> 
<p>"Amen!" responded Caderousse, waving his hand in token of adieu to Danglars, and bending his steps towards the Allées de Meillan, moving his head to and fro, and muttering as he went, after the manner of one whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea. </p>  
<p>清晨，明媚的朝阳染红了天空，抚慰着那吐着白沫的浪潮。 </p> 
<p>瑞瑟夫酒家此时已备好了丰富的酒筵，（酒家的那座凉棚是读者们已熟悉了的）。摆席的那个大厅非常宽敞，并排开着几扇大窗子，每个窗子上都有用金字写着的法国各大城市的名字。在这排窗子底下，是一条跟屋子一样长的木板走廊。筵席虽预定在十二点钟开始。但在这之前的一小时，走廊上便早已挤满了性急的前来贺喜的客人，他们有些是法老号上同唐太斯要好的船员，有些是他的私人朋友，全都穿着最漂亮的衣服，给这个愉快的日子增光不少，大家都在纷纷议论，法老号的船主要来参加婚宴，但大家又似乎都不相信唐太斯能有这么大的面子。 </p> 
<p>还是与卡德鲁斯同来的腾格拉尔证实了这个消息，说他刚才遇到了莫雷尔先生，莫雷尔先生亲口说要来赴宴。 </p> 
<p>果然，不一会儿，莫雷尔先生便走了进来。法老号的水手们纷纷向他致意、欢呼。在他们看来船主的光临证实了一个传闻，唐太斯不久就要做法老号船长了，由于唐太斯是船员们都一致爱戴的人物，所以当船员们发现他们上司的意见和选择正好符合了他们的愿望时，也就禁不住欢喜起来。 </p> 
<p>这一阵嘈杂而亲热的欢迎过去以后，腾格拉尔和卡德鲁斯便被派去到新郎家中去报告重要人物已经到了的消息，希望新郎赶快来迎接他的贵宾。 </p> 
<p>二人便火速前往，但他们还没走出百步远，就有一群人向他们走来，前面走着的那对新人和一群伴随新娘的青年人，新娘的旁边是唐太斯的父亲，他们的后面则跟着弗尔南多。他的脸上仍旧挂着一种阴险的微笑。 </p> 
<p>美塞苔丝和爱德蒙都没有注意到他脸上那种异样的表情。他们实在是太幸福了，所以他们的眼睛除了互相深情地注视着以外，就只看到他们头上那明朗而美丽的天空。 </p> 
<p>腾格拉尔他们完成了自己的使命，并向爱德蒙亲热地道贺以后，腾格拉尔就走到了弗尔南多的身边，卡德鲁斯则和唐太斯老爹留在了一起。老唐太斯现在已成了众人注目的焦点。 </p> 
<p>他穿着一套剪裁合体、熨得笔挺、钉着铁钮扣的黑衣服。他那瘦小但依旧相当有力的小腿上套着一双脚踝处绣满了花的长统袜子，一看便知是英国货；他的三角帽上垂下一长条蓝白色丝带结成的穗子；拄着一根雕刻得很奇特的手杖。卡德鲁斯一副卑谄的样子跟在他身旁，希望美餐一顿的渴望使他又与唐太斯父子重归于好了，昨晚上的事，他脑子里留有模糊不清的印象，——就象人从梦中醒来时脑子里留下的模糊印象一样。 </p> 
<p>腾格拉尔走近那个失恋的情人的时候，意味深长的看了他一眼。只见弗尔南多脸色苍白，神情茫然地慢慢跟在那对幸福的人后面，而面前那对满心欢喜的人却似乎已完全忘记了还有他这个人存在着。他的脸偶尔会突然涨得通红，神经质的抽搐一下，——焦急不安的朝马赛那个方向望一眼，好象在期待某种惊人的大事发生似的。 </p> 
<p>唐太斯的衣着不仅很合式，而且也很简单，他穿着一套半似军服，半似便服的商船船员制服。他那张英俊的脸上闪着喜悦和幸福的光芒，显得更加英气勃发。 </p> 
<p>美塞苔丝可爱得象塞浦路斯或凯奥斯的希腊美女一样，她的眼睛乌黑明亮，嘴唇鲜红娇嫩，她的步伐就象阿尔妇女和安达卢西亚妇女那样轻盈和婀娜多姿。假如她是一个城里姑娘，她一定会把她的喜悦掩饰起来，或至少垂下她那浓密的睫毛，以掩饰她那一对水汪汪的热情的眼睛，但美塞苔丝却是一个劲地微笑着左右顾盼，好象在说：“假如你们是我的朋友，那么就和我一起欢乐吧，因为我实在是太幸福了。” </p> 
<p>当这队伴着新郎新娘的行列进入瑟夫酒家的时候，莫雷尔先生就迎上前来，他身后跟着早已聚集在那儿的士兵和水手，他们已经从莫雷尔先生那儿知道他已经许过的诺言，知道唐太斯就要接替已故的莱克勒船长了，爱德蒙一走到雇主的前面，便把他的未婚妻的手臂递给莫雷尔先生，后者就带着她踏上了木头楼梯，向摆好了酒席的大厅走去，宾客们嘻嘻哈哈地跟在后面，楼梯在拥挤的人群脚下吱吱地响着。 </p> 
<p>“爸爸，”美塞苔丝走到桌子前面停下来说。“请您坐到我的右边，左边这个置人要让一位始终象亲兄弟那样照顾我的人坐，”她这句温柔而甜密的话象一把匕首直刺入弗尔南多的心。他的嘴唇苍白，棕黑的皮肤下，可以看见血液突然退去，象是受到了某种意外的压缩，流回到了心脏里去了一样。 </p> 
<p>这时，坐在桌子对面的唐太斯，也同样正在安排他最尊贵的来宾莫雷尔先生坐在他在右边，腾格拉尔坐在他的左边，其余的人也都各自找到了他们认为最适当的位子坐下。 </p> 
<p>现在便开始尽情地享受那些放满在桌子上的美味佳肴了。新鲜香美的阿尔腊肠，鲜红耀目的带壳龙虾，色彩鲜明的大虾，外面有刺而里面细腻上口的海胆，还有为南方食客所极力赞美、认为比牡蛎还香美可口的蛤蜊——这一切，再加上无数从沙滩上捕来的，被那些该感谢的渔夫称为“海果”的各种珍馔美肴，都呈在了这次婚筵席上。 </p> 
<p>“真安静啊！”新郎的父亲说，他正拿起一杯黄玉色的酒举到嘴边，这杯酒是美塞苔丝献上的，谁会想到这儿有三十个又说又笑的人呢？ </p> 
<p>“唉！”卡德鲁斯叹息到，“做丈夫的并非永远是开心的，”事实是，”唐太斯答，“我是太幸福了，所以反而乐不起来了，假如你是这样认为的话，我可敬的朋友，我想你是说对了，有的时候，快乐会产生一种奇特的效果，它会压住我们，就象悲哀一样。” </p> 
<p>腾格拉尔向弗尔南多看了看，只见他易于激动的天性把每一个新的感受都明显地表露在脸上。 </p> 
<p>“咦，你有什么不快乐？”他问爱德蒙。“你难道怕有什么样的灾难降临吗？我敢说今天在众人眼里你最称心如意啦。” </p> 
<p>“使我感到不安的也正是这一点，”唐太斯答道“在我看来幸福似乎不该这样轻易到手的，幸福应该是我们小时候书上所读到的神奇的魔宫，有凶猛的毒龙守在入口，有各种各样大大小小的的妖魔鬼怪挡主去路，要征服这一切，就非去战斗不可。我现在真得觉得有点奇怪，凭什么获得这份荣耀——做美塞苔丝的丈夫。” </p> 
<p>“丈夫，丈夫？”卡德鲁斯大声笑着说，“还没有做成呢，我的船长，你就试试去做个丈夫吧，瞧瞧会怎么样。” </p> 
<p>美塞苔丝不禁脸上泛起了红晕。焦躁不安的弗尔南多每当听到一点响声就会显得很吃惊的样子，他不时抹一下额头上沁出汗，那汗珠就象暴风雨即将来时落下的雨蹼那样粗大。 </p> 
<p>“哦，那倒没什么，卡德鲁斯邻居，这种小事是不值得一提的，不错，美塞苔丝此刻还不能真正算我的妻子，但是，”他掏出表来看了看，就说，“再过一个半小时，她就是我的妻子了。” </p> 
<p>所有的人都惊叫了一声，只有老唐太斯除外，他开怀大笑，露出一排很整齐的牙齿。美塞苔丝微笑了一下，不再羞涩了。弗尔南多则神经质地紧握着他的刀柄。 </p> 
<p>“一个小时？”腾格拉尔问，他的脸色也变白了，“怎么回事，我的朋友？ </p> 
<p>“是的，，”唐太斯回答道，“在这儿我特别感谢莫雷尔先生在这世界上，除了我父亲以外，我的幸福完全归功于他，由于他的帮忙，一切困难都已经解决了。我们已经付了结婚预告费，两点半的时候，马赛市长就会在维丽大酒家等候我们。现在已经是一点一刻了，所以我说再过一个半小时美塞苔丝会变成唐太斯夫人并非言之过早。” </p> 
<p>弗尔南多闭上了双眼，一种火一样的感觉掠过了他的眉头，他不得不将身子伏在桌子上以免跌倒。他虽然努力克制着自己，但仍禁不住发出一声长叹，但是他的叹息声被嘈杂的祝贺声淹没了。 </p> 
<p>“凭良心，”老人大声说，“这事你办得真迅速。昨天早晨才到这儿的，今天三点钟就结婚！我终于相信了水手是办事的快手！” </p> 
<p>“可是”腾格拉尔胆怯地说。“其它手续怎么办呢，——婚书，文契？” </p> 
<p>“噢，你真是！”唐太斯笑着回答说，“我们的婚书早已写好子。美塞苔丝没有什么财产，我也一样。所以，你看，我们的婚书根本没费多少时间就写好了，而且也没花几个钱。”这个笑话引起众人一阵哄笑和掌声。 </p> 
<p>“那么，我们认为只不过是订婚的喜酒变成结婚的喜酒了。”腾格拉尔说。 </p> 
<p>“不，不！”唐太斯回答，“可别把人看成是那么小器，明天得动身到巴黎去。四天来回，再加一天的时间办事就够了。三月初我就能回来，回来后，第二天我就请大家喝喜酒。” </p> 
<p>想到又一次有美餐的机会，宾客们更加欢乐无比，老唐太斯还在宴席一开始的时候就曾嫌太静，现在人们是如此嘈杂喧哗，他竟很想找一个机会来向新娘新郎表示祝贺了。 </p> 
<p>唐太斯觉察到父亲那种亲热的焦急之情，便愉快地报以感激的一笑。美塞苔丝的眼睛不时地去瞟一眼摆在房子里的钟，她向爱德蒙做了一个手势，示意。 </p> 
<p>席间的气氛是愉快的，无拘无束的，这是在社交集会时司空见惯的现象，大家太快乐了以致摆脱了一切拘谨礼仪的束缚。那些在席间觉得座位不称心的人已经换了位置，并找到了称心如意的邻座。有的人都在乱哄哄地说，不住嘴地说着话，谁也不关心谁，大家都在各说各的话。 </p> 
<p>弗尔南多苍白的脸色似乎已传染给腾格拉尔的脸上，弗尔南多自己却似乎正在忍受着死囚一般的痛苦，他再也坐不住了，站起来首先离开席，象要躲开这一片震耳欲聋的声音里所洋溢的喜气似的，一言不发地在大厅另一端走来走去。 </p> 
<p>弗尔南多似乎要躲开腾格拉尔，而腾格拉尔却偏偏又来找他，卡德鲁斯一见这种情形，也向别房间的那一角走过去。 </p> 
<p>“凭良心讲，”卡德鲁斯说，由于唐太斯友善的款待和他喝下的那些美酒的满足劲也起了作用，他脑子里对唐太斯交了好运的妒嫉之意反而一扫而光了，“——凭良心讲，唐太斯实在是一个顶好的人，当我看到他坐在他那漂亮的未婚妻旁边时候，一想到你们昨天的计划用的那有套把戏，真觉得太不应该了。” </p> 
<p>“哦，那事反正又不是真的，”腾格拉尔回答说，“最初我是出于同情弗尔南多受到的打击，但当我看到他甚至做着他的情敌的伴郎仍完全克制住他自己的情感时，我知道这事就不必再多说了。”卡德鲁斯凝视着弗尔南多，弗尔南多的脸色白的象一张纸。“说实在的，”腾格拉尔又说，“姑娘长得可真美，这个牺牲可不算校说真的，我那位未来的船长真是个交好运的家伙！老天爷！我真希望，我如果是他就好了。” </p> 
<p>“我们可以走了吗？美塞苔丝那银铃般的声音问道，“两点钟已经过了，你知道我们说好的在一刻钟之内到维丽大酒家的。” </p> 
<p>“是的，没错！”唐太斯一面大声说，一面急忙站了起来说：“我们马上就走吧！” </p> 
<p>于上全体宾客随声咐和着，也都一起欢呼着站了起来，并开始组成一个行列。 </p> 
<p>就在这时，正在密切注意着弗尔南多的腾格拉尔突然看见他象痉挛似的抽搐了一下，踉踉跄跄退到了一扇开着的窗子前面，靠在身边的一把椅子上。此时，只听楼梯上响起了一片嘈杂声并夹杂着士兵整齐的步伐，刀剑的铿锵声以及佩挂物的撞击声，接着又传来了一片由众多声音所组成的嗡嗡声，这片嗡嗡声窒息了喜宴的喧哗声，房间里立刻罩上了一种不安的气氛。 </p> 
<p>那嘈声愈来愈近了。房门上响起了三下叩击声。人们神色惊奇面面相觑。 </p> 
<p>“我们是来执行法院命令的，”一个响亮的声音喊道，但房间里谁也没有应声，门开了，一个佩挂绶带的警长走了进来，后面跟着四个士兵和一个伍长。在场的人们现在由不安变成了极端的恐惧。 </p> 
<p>“请问警长突然驾到，有何贵干？”莫雷尔先生走上前去对那警长说道，他们显然是彼此认识的。“我想一定是发生了什么误会吧。” </p> 
<p>“莫雷尔先生。”警长回答道，“如果是误会，很快就可以澄清的。现在，我只是奉命来把人带走，虽然我自己也很不愿意执行交给我的这项任务，但我又必须完成它。在这些人当中哪位是爱德蒙·唐太斯？”人们的眼睛唰得一下都转了那青年身上，那青年虽也很不安，却依旧很庄严地挺身而出，用坚定的口吻说：“我就是，请问有什么事？” </p> 
<p>“爱德蒙·唐太斯，”警长回答说，“我以法律的名义逮捕你！” </p> 
<p>“逮捕我！”爱德蒙应了一声，脸上微微有点变色，“请问这是为什么？” </p> 
<p>“我不清楚，不过你在第一次被审问的时候就会知道的。” </p> 
<p>莫雷尔先生觉得此事辩也是没用的。一个绶带军官在外执行命令已不再是一个人，而变成了冷酷无情的法律的化身。 </p> 
<p>老唐太斯急忙向警长走去，——因为有些事情是做父母的心所无法了解的。他拼命的求情，他的恳求和眼泪虽毫无用处，但他那极度失望的样子却打动了警长的同情心。“先生，”他说，“请你冷静一点。您的儿子大概是触犯了海关或卫生公署的某些条例，很可能在回答几个问题以后就会被释放的。” </p> 
<p>“这到底是怎么回事？”卡德鲁斯横眉怒目地问腾格拉尔，而后者却装出一副莫名其妙的的神情。 </p> 
<p>“我怎么知道？”他答道，“我和你一样，对眼前的事根本一无所知，他们说的话我一点儿都不懂。”卡德鲁斯于是用目光四下里寻找弗尔南多，但他已经不见了。 </p> 
<p>前一天的情景极其清晰地浮现在他脑子里了。他现在目击的这场突如其来的横祸已揭去了他昨天醉酒时蒙在记忆上的那层薄纱。 </p> 
<p>“哼！”他声音嘶哑地对腾格拉尔说，“这个，难道就是你昨天那套鬼把戏里的一部分吧？果真如此的话，玩把戏的那个家伙真该死！这种做法太可耻了。” </p> 
<p>“别胡说了。”腾格拉尔反驳道，“你明明看见我把那张纸撕碎了扔了的。 </p> 
<p>“不，你没有！”卡德鲁斯答道，“你只是把它扔在了一边。我看见你把它扔在一个角落里了。” </p> 
<p>“闭嘴！你根本什么也没看见。你当时喝醉了！” </p> 
<p>“弗尔南多去哪儿了？”卡德鲁斯问。 </p> 
<p>“我怎么知道？”腾格拉尔回答，“大概是处理他自己的事情去了吧，先别管他在哪儿了，我们赶紧去看看有没有什么办法可以帮一下我们那位可怜的朋友。” </p> 
<p>在他们谈话的时候，唐太斯正和他的朋友们一一握手告别，然后他走到那位官员身边，说：“请诸位放心，我只不过去解释一些小误会而已，我想我又没犯什么法，不会坐牢的。” </p> 
<p>“唔，肯定是这样！”腾格拉尔接着话茬说，他现在已走到大家的前面，“我相信只不过是一点误会而已。” </p> 
<p>唐太斯夹在警长和士兵中间走下楼去。门口已有一辆马车在等候着他了。他钻进了车里，两个兵和那警长也接着进去了，马车就向马赛驶去了。 </p> 
<p>“再见了，再见了，我亲爱的爱德蒙！”美塞苔丝扑到栏杆上向他伸出手臂大声喊着。 </p> 
<p>这样被带走的人听到那最后的一声呼喊，象感到了他未婚妻的心被撕碎了一般，他从车厢里探出头来喊道：“再见了，美塞苔丝。”于是马车就转过圣尼古位堡的一个拐角不见了。 </p> 
<p>“你们大家都在这儿等我！”莫雷尔先生喊道，“我马上找一辆马车赶到马赛去，等打听着消息回来告诉你们。” </p> 
<p>“对呀！”许多声音异口同声的喊道，“去吧，快去快回！” </p> 
<p>莫雷尔先生走了以后，留下来的那些人都有些不知所措。 </p> 
<p>老爹和美塞苔丝各自怀着满腹的忧愁木然呆立着，最后，这两个遭受同一打击下的不幸的人的目光终于碰到了一起，悲伤地拥抱在了一起。这时弗尔南多又出现了，他用一只颤抖的手给自己倒了一杯水，一饮而尽，然后在一张椅子上坐了下来。 </p> 
<p>美塞苔丝已离开了老人的怀抱，正虚弱地倒在一张椅子上，碰巧弗尔南多的座位就在她的旁边，他本能地把他的椅子拖后了一点。 </p> 
<p>“是他！”卡德鲁斯低声对腾格拉尔说，他的眼睛始终没离开过弗尔南多。 </p> 
<p>“我倒不这样认为，”那一个回答说，“他太蠢了，绝想不出这种计谋的。我希望那个做孽的人会受惩罚。” </p> 
<p>“你怎么不说那个给他出谋划策的人该受罚呢！”卡德鲁斯说。 </p> 
<p>“当然罗，”腾格拉尔说，“不过，并不是每个人都要对他随口说的负责的！” </p> 
<p>“哼，如果随便讲话的真的兑现了就该他负责。” </p> 
<p>这时，对被捕这件事大家都在议论纷纷。 </p> 
<p>“腾格拉尔，”有人问，“你对这事怎么看？” </p> 
<p>“我想，”腾格拉尔说，“可能是唐太斯在船上被搜出了什么被认为是违禁品的小东西吧。” </p> 
<p>“但假如他真这样做了，你怎么会不知道呢？腾格拉尔，你不是船上的押运员吗？” </p> 
<p>“我只知道我要对船上装的货物负责。我知道船上装着棉花，是从亚历山大港潘斯德里先生的货仓和士麦拿潘斯考先生的货仓里装上船的。我所知道仅此而已，至于别的什么，我是没必要去过问的。” </p> 
<p>“噢，现在我想起来了！”那可怜的老爹说，“我的儿子昨天告诉我，说他有一小盒咖啡和一点烟草在船上带给我！” </p> 
<p>“你看，这就对了！”腾格拉尔宣称说。“现在祸根找着了，一定是海关关员当我不在的时候上船去搜查，发现了可怜的唐太斯藏着宝贝了。” </p> 
<p>美塞苔丝根本不相信她的爱人被捕的这种说法。她一直努力克制着悲哀，现在突然地放声大哭起来。 </p> 
<p>“别哭，别哭，”老人说，“我可怜的孩子，事情会有希望！” </p> 
<p>“会有希望的！腾格拉尔也说。 </p> 
<p>“会有希望的！”弗尔南多也想这么说，但他的话却哽住了，他的嘴唇蠕动了一下，但始终没发出声音来。 </p> 
<p>“这下好了！好消息！”站在走廊上的一个人忽然喊道。 </p> 
<p>“莫雷尔先生回来了。他一定会带好消息给我们的。” </p> 
<p>美塞苔丝和老人急忙奔向前去迎接船主，在门口碰到了他。莫雷尔先生的脸色非常惨白。 </p> 
<p>“有什么消息？”大家异口同声地问。 </p> 
<p>“唉，诸位，”莫雷尔先生无奈地摇摇头说，“事情比我们预料的要严重得多。” </p> 
<p>“呵，先生，他是无罪的呀！”美塞苔丝抽搭着说。 </p> 
<p>“这我相信！”莫雷尔先生回答说，“可是他仍然被指控为——” </p> 
<p>“什么罪名？”老唐太斯问。 </p> 
<p>“控他是一个拿破仑党的眼线！” </p> 
<p>读者们一定还记得，在我们这个故事发生的那个年代，这是多么可怕的一个罪名。美塞苔丝绝望地惨叫了一声，而心碎的老人则气息奄奄地倒在了一张椅子上。 </p> 
<p>“腾格拉尔！”卡德鲁斯低声说，“你骗了我，——昨天晚上你说的那套鬼把戏已成现实了。现在我明白了。但我不忍心看到一个可怜的老头子和一个无辜的姑娘这样痛苦不堪。我要去把一切都告诉他们。” </p> 
<p>“闭嘴，你这傻瓜！”腾格拉尔急忙抓住他的胳膊恶狠狠地说，“不然我可不负责你自己的人身安全。谁能说清楚唐太斯究竟是有罪还是无罪？船的确停靠过厄尔巴岛，他的确曾离船在岛上呆了一整天。现在，假如从他身上找到什么有关的信件或其他文件，到那时凡是帮他说话的人都会被看作是他的同谋的。” </p> 
<p>出于自私心的本能，卡德鲁斯立刻感觉出了这番话的份量。他满脸恐惧和忧虑地望着腾格拉尔，然后连忙采取了进一步退两步的态度。 </p> 
<p>“那么，我们等等再说吧。”他嗫嚅着说道。 </p> 
<p>“是啊！”腾格拉尔回答。“我们等等再说吧。假如他的确是无辜的，那自然会被释放，假如的确有罪，那我们可犯不上为他而受连累。” </p> 
<p>“那么我们走吧。我们不能再呆在这儿了。” </p> 
<p>“好，我们走吧！”腾格拉尔为能找到一个一同退场的同伴而感到很高兴。“我们不管这事了，别人爱走不走，随他们的便。” </p> 
<p>他们走了以后，弗尔南多又成了美塞苔丝的保护人了，领她回迦太兰村去了。而唐太斯的一些朋友则护送着那位心碎的老人回家去了。 </p> 
<p>爱德蒙被控为拿破仑党的眼线从而被捕的消息很快就在城里流传开了。 </p> 
<p>“你能相信有这种事情吗，我亲爱的腾格拉尔？”莫雷尔先生问，他因急于回城去打听唐太斯的新消息，途中赶上了他的押运员和卡德鲁斯。“你认为这种事可能吗？” </p> 
<p>“噢，您知道，我已经对您说过，”腾格拉尔回答说“我觉得他在厄尔巴岛停靠这件事是非常可疑的。” </p> 
<p>“你的这种怀疑除了对我以外还对别人提起过吗？” </p> 
<p>“当然没有！”腾格拉尔回答说。然后又低声耳语道，“您知道，您的叔叔波立卡·莫雷尔先生曾在先朝当过官，而且关于这件事又不怎么隐讳，所以说不定您也会有很大的嫌疑的，人家会说您也不满于拿破仑的垮台。假如我对别人讲了我心中的疑虑那我不是就伤害到了爱德蒙和您么。我很清楚，象我这样做下属的人，不论发生了什么事情，都应该先通知船主，而且必须小心谨慎，不能让其他的人知道才行。” </p> 
<p>“很好，腾格拉尔，很好！”莫雷尔先生说道。“你是一个好小伙子，本来，我在安排那可怜的爱德蒙当法老号的船长的时候，也打算过如何安排你的。” </p> 
<p>“你说什么，先生！” </p> 
<p>“我事先曾问过唐太斯，问他对你有何看法，对你继续在船任职什么意见——因为我已看出你们之间的关系相当冷淡。” </p> 
<p>“他是怎么回答的？” </p> 
<p>“他说他的确因某件事得罪过你，但记不清是为什么了。他说不论是谁，只要船主信任他，他也应该尊敬他。” </p> 
<p>“伪君子！”腾格拉尔低声地骂了一句。 </p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p>&nbsp; </p> 
<p>“可怜的唐太斯！”卡德鲁斯说。“谁都无法否认他是一个心地高尚的好小伙子！” </p> 
<p>“可就目前这种状况来看，”莫雷尔先生继续说，“我们可别忘了法老号现在是处在没有船长管理的状态之中。” </p> 
<p>“噢！”腾格拉尔回答说，“反正我们三个月之内还不会离开这个港口，但愿到那时，唐太斯能被释放出来。” </p> 
<p>“这点我毫不怀疑，只是这期间我们怎么办呢？” </p> 
<p>“哦，这期间反正我在这儿，莫雷尔先生，”腾格拉尔答道，“您也知道，我管理船上一切的本领，并不亚于经验最丰富的现任船长。假如您愿意让我为您效劳，这对您也是很有利的，因为唐太斯一旦获释回来，法老号上的人事就不必再变动了，只要唐太斯和我各干各的本职工作就行了。” </p> 
<p>“谢谢，我的好朋友，谢谢你的这个好主意——这下可把所有问题都解决了。我立刻任命你来指挥法老号，并监督卸货。不论个人出了什么事，业务总不能受影响。” </p> 
<p>“请放心好了，莫雷尔先生，但您想我们什么时候才去探望可怜的爱德蒙呢？” </p> 
<p>“我见到维尔福先生以后，就可以马上让你知道的，我要尽力要求他为爱德蒙说说情。我知道他是个激烈的保王党。但是，除了这点和他那检察官的地位以外，他也是个人，而且我不认为他是个坏人！” </p> 
<p>“也许不是坏人，”腾格拉尔答道，“但我听说，他野心勃勃，而野心又最会使人的心肠变硬的！” </p> 
<p>“唉，也只能这样了！”莫雷尔先生说，“我们走一步看一步吧！你现在赶快到船上去吧，我等会儿到船上来找你。”说着那可敬的船主离开了那两位朋友，向法院的方向走去了。 </p> 
<p>“你看，”腾格拉尔对卡德鲁斯说，“事情变复杂了吧。你现在还想去为爱德蒙辩护吗？” </p> 
<p>“不，当然不，但我觉得开玩笑竟开出这样可怕的后果也实在太可怕了。” </p> 
<p>“我倒要问问，这种后果是谁造成的？不是你，也不是我，而是弗尔南多。你当然知道得很清楚，我把那张纸丢在房间的角落里了，——真的，我还以为我当时把它撕了呢。” </p> 
<p>“噢，没有！”卡德鲁斯答道，“这一点我记得很清楚，你没有撕。我清清楚楚地看见你把它揉皱了丢在凉棚角落里，我倒真希望那纸条现在还在那儿。” </p> 
<p>“嗯，如果你的确看到过，那又有什么办法，一定是弗尔南多把它拾了起来，另外抄了一遍，或改写了一遍，或许，他甚至根本就没重抄。现在我想起来了，天哪！他也许就是把那张纸条给送去了１谢天谢地，幸亏我那笔迹是伪装过的。” </p> 
<p>“那么，你是否早就知道唐太斯参与了谋反的呢？” </p> 
<p>“不，我早就说过，我还以为只不过是一个玩笑罢了。但似乎是，象阿尔勒甘一样，我在玩笑中道出了实情。” </p> 
<p>“可是，”卡德鲁斯又说道，“我真不愿意看到发生这样的事，或至少应该与我无关。你就等着瞧吧，腾格拉尔，这件事会使我们两个都倒霉的。” </p> 
<p>“胡说！如果这件事真会带来什么灾难，那也应该落到那个罪人的头上，而那个人，你也知道，是弗尔南多。我们怎么会牵扯在里面呢？只要我们自己保守秘密，不声不响的，对这件事不去对别人泄露一个字就得了。这样你就会看到那风波过去，而我们丝毫不受任何影响。” </p> 
<p>“那好吧！”卡德鲁斯答应了一声，就挥手告别了腾格拉尔，朝梅朗港方向走去了，他一边走，一面晃动着脑袋嘴里还念念有词的，像在自己苦思冥想似的。 </p> 
<p>“好了，现在，”腾格拉尔自言自语地说，“一切都已随了我的心愿。我已暂时当上了法老号船长，而且还可能永远地当下去，只要卡德鲁斯那个傻瓜不多嘴多舌的。我只怕唐太斯会重新放出来的。不过，他已落到了法院的手里，”他又带着微笑说，“而法院是公正的，”说着，他便跳进了一只小艇，叫人摇到法老号上去，因为莫雷尔先生说过要在那儿见他的。 </p>
