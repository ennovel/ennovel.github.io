The prisoner himself is named Edmond Dantès, mate on board the three-master the Pharaon, trading in cotton with Alexandria and Smyrna, and belonging to Morrel &amp; Son, of Marseilles." </p> 
<p>"Before he entered the merchant service, had he ever served in the marines?" </p> 
<p>"Oh, no, monsieur, he is very young." </p> 
<p>"How old?" </p> 
<p>"Nineteen or twenty at the most." </p> 
<p>At this moment, and as Villefort had arrived at the corner of the Rue des Conseils, a man, who seemed to have been waiting for him, approached; it was M. Morrel. </p> 
<p>"Ah, M. de Villefort," cried he, "I am delighted to see you. Some of your people have committed the strangest mistake--they have just arrested Edmond Dantès, mate of my vessel." </p> 
<p>"I know it, monsieur," replied Villefort, "and I am now going to examine him." </p> 
<p>"Oh," said Morrel, carried away by his friendship, "you do not know him, and I do. He is the most estimable, the most trustworthy creature in the world, and I will venture to say, there is not a better seaman in all the merchant service. Oh, M. de Villefort, I beseech your indulgence for him." </p> 
<p>Villefort, as we have seen, belonged to the aristocratic party at Marseilles, Morrel to the plebeian; the first was a royalist, the other suspected of Bonapartism. Villefort looked disdainfully at Morrel, and replied,-- </p> 
<p>"You are aware, monsieur, that a man may be estimable and trustworthy in private life, and the best seaman in the merchant service, and yet be, politically speaking, a great criminal. Is it not true?" </p> 
<p>The magistrate laid emphasis on these words, as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself, while his eyes seemed to plunge into the heart of one who, interceding for another, had himself need of indulgence. Morrel reddened, for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics; besides, what Dantès had told him of his interview with the grand-marshal, and what the emperor had said to him, embarrassed him. He replied, however,-- </p> 
<p>"I entreat you, M. de Villefort, be, as you always are, kind and equitable, and give him back to us soon." </p> 
<p>This give us sounded revolutionary in the deputy's ears. </p> 
<p>"Ah, ah," murmured he, "is Dantès then a member of some Carbonari society, that his protector thus employs the collective form? He was, if I recollect, arrested in a tavern, in company with a great many others." Then he added, "Monsieur, you may rest assured I shall perform my duty impartially, and that if he be innocent you shall not have appealed to me in vain; should he, however, be guilty, in this present epoch, impunity would furnish a dangerous example, and I must do my duty." </p> 
<p>As he had now arrived at the door of his own house, which adjoined the Palais de Justice, he entered, after having, coldly saluted the shipowner, who stood, as if petrified, on the spot where Villefort had left him. The ante-chamber was full of police agents and gendarmes, in the midst of whom, carefully watched, but calm and smiling, stood the prisoner. Villefort traversed the ante-chamber, cast a side glance at Dantès, and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him, disappeared, saying, "Bring in the prisoner." </p> 
<p>Rapid as had been Villefort's glance, it had served to give him an idea of the man he was about to interrogate. He had recognized intelligence in the high forehead, courage in the dark eye and bent brow, and frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth. Villefort's first impression was favorable; but he had been so often warned to mistrust first impulses, that he applied the maxim to the impression, forgetting the difference between the two words. He stifled, therefore, the feelings of compassion that were rising, composed his features, and sat down, grim and sombre, at his desk. An instant after Dantès entered. He was pale, but calm and collected, and saluting his judge with easy politeness, looked round for a seat, as if he had been in M. Morrel's salon. It was then that he encountered for the first time Villefort's look,--that look peculiar to the magistrate, who, while seeming to read the thoughts of others, betrays nothing of his own. </p> 
<p>"Who and what are you?" demanded Villefort, turning over a pile of papers, containing information relative to the prisoner, that a police agent had given to him on his entry, and that, already, in an hour's time, had swelled to voluminous proportions, thanks to the corrupt espionage of which "the accused" is always made the victim. </p> 
<p>"My name is Edmond Dantès," replied the young man calmly; "I am mate of the Pharaon, belonging to Messrs. Morrel &amp; Son." </p> 
<p>"Your age?" continued Villefort. </p> 
<p>"Nineteen," returned Dantès. </p> 
<p>"What were you doing at the moment you were arrested?" </p> 
<p>"I was at the festival of my marriage, monsieur," said the young man, his voice slightly tremulous, so great was the contrast between that happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing; so great was the contrast between the sombre aspect of M. de Villefort and the radiant face of Mercédès. </p> 
<p>"You were at the festival of your marriage?" said the deputy, shuddering in spite of himself. </p> 
<p>"Yes, monsieur; I am on the point of marrying a young girl I have been attached to for three years." Villefort, impassive as he was, was struck with this coincidence; and the tremulous voice of Dantès, surprised in the midst of his happiness, struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosom--he also was on the point of being married, and he was summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another. "This philosophic reflection," thought he, "will make a great sensation at M. de Saint-Méran's;" and he arranged mentally, while Dantès awaited further questions, the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence. When this speech was arranged, Villefort turned to Dantès. </p> 
<p>"Go on, sir," said he. </p> 
<p>"What would you have me say?" </p> 
<p>"Give all the information in your power." </p> 
<p>"Tell me on which point you desire information, and I will tell all I know; only," added he, with a smile, "I warn you I know very little." </p> 
<p>"Have you served under the usurper?" </p> 
<p>"I was about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he fell." </p> 
<p>"It is reported your political opinions are extreme," said Villefort, who had never heard anything of the kind, but was not sorry to make this inquiry, as if it were an accusation. </p> 
<p>"My political opinions!" replied Dantès. "Alas, sir, I never had any opinions. I am hardly nineteen; I know nothing; I have no part to play. If I obtain the situation I desire, I shall owe it to M. Morrel. Thus all my opinions--I will not say public, but private--are confined to these three sentiment,--I love my father, I respect M. Morrel, and I adore Mercédès. This, sir, is all I can tell you, and you see how uninteresting it is." As Dantès spoke, Villefort gazed at his ingenuous and open countenance, and recollected the words of Renée, who, without knowing who the culprit was, had besought his indulgence for him. With the deputy's knowledge of crime and criminals, every word the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence. This lad, for he was scarcely a man,--simple, natural, eloquent with that eloquence of the heart never found when sought for; full of affection for everybody, because he was happy, and because happiness renders even the wicked good--extended his affection even to his judge, spite of Villefort's severe look and stern accent. Dantès seemed full of kindness. </p> 
<p>"Pardieu!" said Villefort, "he is a noble fellow. I hope I shall gain Renée's favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on me. I shall have at least a pressure of the hand in public, and a sweet kiss in private." Full of this idea, Villefort's face became so joyous, that when he turned to Dantès, the latter, who had watched the change on his physiognomy, was smiling also. </p> 
<p>"Sir," said Villefort, "have you any enemies, at least, that you know." </p> 
<p>"I have enemies?" replied Dantès; "my position is not sufficiently elevated for that. As for my disposition, that is, perhaps, somewhat too hasty; but I have striven to repress it. I have had ten or twelve sailors under me, and if you question them, they will tell you that they love and respect me, not as a father, for I am too young, but as an elder brother." </p> 
<p>"But you may have excited jealousy. You are about to become captain at nineteen--an elevated post; you are about to marry a pretty girl, who loves you; and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the envy of some one." </p> 
<p>"You are right; you know men better than I do, and what you say may possibly be the case, I confess; but if such persons are among my acquaintances I prefer not to know it, because then I should be forced to hate them." </p> 
<p>"You are wrong; you should always strive to see clearly around you. You seem a worthy young man; I will depart from the strict line of my duty to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation. Here is the paper; do you know the writing?" As he spoke, Villefort drew the letter from his pocket, and presented it to Dantès. Dantès read it. A cloud passed over his brow as he said,-- </p> 
<p>"No, monsieur, I do not know the writing, and yet it is tolerably plain. Whoever did it writes well. I am very fortunate," added he, looking gratefully at Villefort, "to be examined by such a man as you; for this envious person is a real enemy." And by the rapid glance that the young man's eyes shot forth, Villefort saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mildness. </p> 
<p>"Now," said the deputy, "answer me frankly, not as a prisoner to a judge, but as one man to another who takes an interest in him, what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous letter?" And Villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter Dantès had just given back to him. </p> 
<p>"None at all. I will tell you the real facts. I swear by my honor as a sailor, by my love for Mercédès, by the life of my father"-- </p> 
<p>"Speak, monsieur," said Villefort. Then, internally, "If Renée could see me, I hope she would be satisfied, and would no longer call me a decapitator." </p> 
<p>"Well, when we quitted Naples, Captain Leclere was attacked with a brain fever. As we had no doctor on board, and he was so anxious to arrive at Elba, that he would not touch at any other port, his disorder rose to such a height, that at the end of the third day, feeling he was dying, he called me to him. 'My dear Dantès,' said he, 'swear to perform what I am going to tell you, for it is a matter of the deepest importance.' </p> 
<p>"'I swear, captain,' replied I. </p> 
<p>"'Well, as after my death the command devolves on you as mate, assume the command, and bear up for the Island of Elba, disembark at Porto-Ferrajo, ask for the grand-marshal, give him this letter--perhaps they will give you another letter, and charge you with a commission. You will accomplish what I was to have done, and derive all the honor and profit from it.' </p> 
<p>"'I will do it, captain; but perhaps I shall not be admitted to the grand marshal's presence as easily as you expect?' </p> 
<p>"'Here is a ring that will obtain audience of him, and remove every difficulty,' said the captain. At these words he gave me a ring. It was time--two hours after he was delirious; the next day he died." </p> 
<p>"And what did you do then?" </p> 
<p>"What I ought to have done, and what every one would have done in my place. Everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred; but with a sailor the last requests of his superior are commands. I sailed for the Island of Elba, where I arrived the next day; I ordered everybody to remain on board, and went on shore alone. As I had expected, I found some difficulty in obtaining access to the grand-marshal; but I sent the ring I had received from the captain to him, and was instantly admitted. He questioned me concerning Captain Leclere's death; and, as the latter had told me, gave me a letter to carry on to a person in Paris. I undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do. I landed here, regulated the affairs of the vessel, and hastened to visit my affianced bride, whom I found more lovely than ever. Thanks to M. Morrel, all the forms were got over; in a word I was, as I told you, at my marriage-feast; and I should have been married in an hour, and to-morrow I intended to start for Paris, had I not been arrested on this charge which you as well as I now see to be unjust." </p> 
<p>"Ah," said Villefort, "this seems to me the truth. If you have been culpable, it was imprudence, and this imprudence was in obedience to the orders of your captain. Give up this letter you have brought from Elba, and pass your word you will appear should you be required, and go and rejoin your friends. </p> 
<p>"I am free, then, sir?" cried Dantès joyfully. </p> 
<p>"Yes; but first give me this letter." </p> 
<p>"You have it already, for it was taken from me with some others which I see in that packet." </p> 
<p>"Stop a moment," said the deputy, as Dantès took his hat and gloves. "To whom is it addressed?" </p> 
<p>"To Monsieur Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, Paris." Had a thunderbolt fallen into the room, Villefort could not have been more stupefied. He sank into his seat, and hastily turning over the packet, drew forth the fatal letter, at which he glanced with an expression of terror. </p> 
<p>"M. Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, No. 13," murmured he, growing still paler. </p> 
<p>"Yes," said Dantès; "do you know him?" </p> 
<p>"No," replied Villefort; "a faithful servant of the king does not know conspirators." </p> 
<p>"It is a conspiracy, then?" asked Dantès, who after believing himself free, now began to feel a tenfold alarm. "I have, however, already told you, sir, I was entirely ignorant of the contents of the letter." </p> 
<p>"Yes; but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed," said Villefort. </p> 
<p>"I was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it." </p> 
<p>"Have you shown this letter to any one?" asked Villefort, becoming still more pale. </p> 
<p>"To no one, on my honor." </p> 
<p>"Everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the Island of Elba, and addressed to M. Noirtier?" </p> 
<p>"Everybody, except the person who gave it to me." </p> 
<p>"And that was too much, far too much," murmured Villefort. Villefort's brow darkened more and more, his white lips and clinched teeth filled Dantès with apprehension. After reading the letter, Villefort covered his face with his hands. </p> 
<p>"Oh," said Dantès timidly, "what is the matter?" Villefort made no answer, but raised his head at the expiration of a few seconds, and again perused the letter. </p> 
<p>"And you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter?" </p> 
<p>"I give you my word of honor, sir," said Dantès; "but what is the matter? You are ill--shall I ring for assistance?--shall I call?" </p> 
<p>"No," said Villefort, rising hastily; "stay where you are. It is for me to give orders here, and not you." </p> 
<p>"Monsieur," replied Dantès proudly, "it was only to summon assistance for you." </p> 
<p>"I want none; it was a temporary indisposition. Attend to yourself; answer me." Dantès waited, expecting a question, but in vain. Villefort fell back on his chair, passed his hand over his brow, moist with perspiration, and, for the third time, read the letter. </p> 
<p>"Oh, if he knows the contents of this!" murmured he, "and that Noirtier is the father of Villefort, I am lost!" And he fixed his eyes upon Edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts. </p> 
<p>"Oh, it is impossible to doubt it," cried he, suddenly. </p> 
<p>"In heaven's name!" cried the unhappy young man, "if you doubt me, question me; I will answer you." Villefort made a violent effort, and in a tone he strove to render firm,-- </p> 
<p>"Sir," said he, "I am no longer able, as I had hoped, to restore you immediately to liberty; before doing so, I must consult the trial justice; what my own feeling is you already know." </p> 
<p>"Oh, monsieur," cried Dantès, "you have been rather a friend than a judge." </p> 
<p>"Well, I must detain you some time longer, but I will strive to make it as short as possible. The principal charge against you is this letter, and you see"--Villefort approached the fire, cast it in, and waited until it was entirely consumed. </p> 
<p>"You see, I destroy it?" </p> 
<p>"Oh," exclaimed Dantès, "you are goodness itself." </p> 
<p>"Listen," continued Villefort; "you can now have confidence in me after what I have done." </p> 
<p>"Oh, command, and I will obey." </p> 
<p>"Listen; this is not a command, but advice I give you." </p> 
<p>"Speak, and I will follow your advice." </p> 
<p>"I shall detain you until this evening in the Palais de Justice. Should any one else interrogate you, say to him what you have said to me, but do not breathe a word of this letter." </p> 
<p>"I promise." It was Villefort who seemed to entreat, and the prisoner who reassured him. </p> 
<p>"You see," continued he, glancing toward the grate, where fragments of burnt paper fluttered in the flames, "the letter is destroyed; you and I alone know of its existence; should you, therefore, be questioned, deny all knowledge of it--deny it boldly, and you are saved." </p> 
<p>"Be satisfied; I will deny it." </p> 
<p>"It was the only letter you had?" </p> 
<p>"It was." </p> 
<p>"Swear it." </p> 
<p>"I swear it." </p> 
<p>Villefort rang. A police agent entered. Villefort whispered some words in his ear, to which the officer replied by a motion of his head. </p> 
<p>"Follow him," said Villefort to Dantès. Dantès saluted Villefort and retired. Hardly had the door closed when Villefort threw himself half-fainting into a chair. </p> 
<p>"Alas, alas," murmured he, "if the procureur himself had been at Marseilles I should have been ruined. This accursed letter would have destroyed all my hopes. Oh, my father, must your past career always interfere with my successes?" Suddenly a light passed over his face, a smile played round his set mouth, and his haggard eyes were fixed in thought. </p>  
<p>维尔福刚一进客厅，便收起了笑容，作出了一副手握生死大权者的庄严气派。他脸部的表情极富于变化，——这是他常常对着镜子训练出来的，因为一个职业演说家就应该是这样的表情，现在他得费点劲才能皱起他的眉头，装出一副庄严沉着的气派。维尔福唯一感到遗憾的就是他父亲的政治路线，如果不是他自己处事极端审慎，那过去的事情就会影响到他现在的事业，但除此之外，他可以说是享尽人间的幸福了。他很富有，虽然他仅仅只有２７岁，但已居高位，他快要和一个年青美丽的姑娘结婚，他爱她。并非出于热情，而是出于理智，是以一个代理检察官的态度爱她，他的未婚妻，不仅美丽而且还出身于最显赫的名门望族，她的父母膝下只有一个女儿，所以他们的政治势力可以全部用来培植他们的女婿。此外，她还可以给他带来一笔五万艾居的嫁奁，将来有一天大概还可以增加五十万遗产。这一切因素综合起来，使维尔福得到了无限的幸福，所以，当维尔福略一回省，静心默察自己内心世界的时候，他就好象自己眼花缭乱了起来。 </p> 
<p>维尔福在门口遇了正在等候他的警官。一见到这位警长，他便从九天之外回到地面上来了，于是他的脸上马上摆出了一副道貌岸然的样子，说道，那“信我看过了，先生，您办得很对，应该把那个人逮起来。现在请你告诉我，你有没有搜有到有关他造反的材料？” </p> 
<p>“关于他造反的材料，先生，我们现在还无从知道，我得到的材料已经放到您的办公桌上了。犯人名子叫爱德蒙·唐太斯，是三桅大帆船法老号上的大副，那条船是从亚历山大和士麦拿装棉花来的，是马摩父子公司所有。” </p> 
<p>“他在从事航海这个工作以前，有没有在海军服过役呢？” </p> 
<p>“哦，没有，先生，他还很年轻。” </p> 
<p>“多大年纪？” </p> 
<p>“顶多还不过十九、二十岁。” </p> 
<p>这时，维尔福已经走到民康尼尔大街的拐角边处，有一个人似乎在那儿等他，那人走向前来，是莫雷尔先生。 </p> 
<p>“哦，维尔福先生，”他喊道，“很高兴见到您！刚才发生了一个很令人不可思意的事情——您手下的人把我船上的大副，爱德蒙·唐太斯抓走了。” </p> 
<p>“这事我知道，先生，”维尔福回答，“我现在就是去审问的。” </p> 
<p>“噢，”莫雷尔说道，由于他对那个朋友友情甚笃，便急切地求起情来，“您不知道他，但我很了解他。他是世界上最善良、最正直的人了，我敢说，在整个商船界，再没有一个比他更好的船员了，维尔福先生，我真心诚意地向您担保！” </p> 
<p>正如我们已经知道维尔福是马赛上流社会中的人物，而莫雷尔只是一个平民，前者是一个保守党，而后者是一个拿破仑党的嫌疑犯。维尔福轻蔑地看着莫雷尔，冷冷地回答道。 </p> 
<p>“你知道，阁下，一个人的私生活上也可能是可敬可靠的，可以是商船界里最好的船员，但从政治上讲，可能是一个罪大恶极的人，是不是？” </p> 
<p>代理法官这番话的语气很重，仿佛是冲着船主说的，而他那审视的眼光似乎直穿对方的心内，象是说，你竟敢为别人说人情，你应该知道你本人还需要宽大处理。莫雷尔的脸刷地红了，因为在政治方面，他的见解并不十分明朗；此外，唐太斯告诉过他的有关他谒见大元帅的事，以及皇上对他说的那番话更增加了他内心的不安，但他仍用深为关怀的语气说；“维尔福先生，我求您，您一向所做的事都是那样公正仁慈，早些把他送还给我们吧。” </p> 
<p>这“给我们”三个字在代理检察官听来很有些革命的味道。“哦，哦！”他思忖道“难道唐太斯是烧炭党［十九世纪初意大利的一个秘密政治组织，因经常装扮成烧炭人集会于树林，故称烧炭党。］分子，不然的话他的保护人要用这种态度来求情呢？我记得他是在一个酒店里被捕的，当时有许多人同他在一起，假如他是冤枉的，那你的求情一定不会落空的，但是如果他有罪，那也只能施以惩罚。否则在目前这个时期，有罪不惩可太危险了，我不得不行使我的职权。” </p> 
<p>这时，他已走到了自己的家门口，他的家就在法院隔壁，他态度冷淡地向船长行了个礼便进去了。那船主呆呆地立在维尔福离开他的地方，客厅里挤满了警察和宪兵，在他们中间，站着那个罪犯，他虽然被严加看管，却很镇定，而且还带着微笑。维尔福穿过客厅，瞥了唐太斯一眼，从一个宪兵手里接过一包东西，一边向里走，一边说：“把犯人带进来。” </p> 
<p>维尔福刚才那一瞥虽然急促，但对那个即将要审问的犯人却已经有了一个初步的看法，他已从他那饱满的前额上看出了他的聪慧，从那黑眼睛里和弯弯的眉毛看出了勇敢，从那半张着的，露出一排洁白的牙齿的厚嘴唇上看出了他的直率。 </p> 
<p>维尔福的第一个印象很不错，但他也常常听人讲。切勿信任第一次的冲动，他把这句格言也用到印象上了，而且不顾这两者间的差别了，所以他抑住心头的怜悯感，板起脸来，在他的办公桌前座了下来，过了一会，唐太斯进来了，他的脸色也很苍白，但是很镇定，还是带着微笑，他从容有礼的向法官行了个礼，四下里看了看，象找个座位，好象他是在莫雷尔先生的客厅里似的，就在这时，当他的目光接触到维尔福的目光——那种法官所特有的目光，似乎象要看透嫌疑犯脑子里的罪恶思想似的。 </p> 
<p>“你是干什么的？”维尔福一边问，一边翻阅着一堆文件，那里边有关于这个犯人的材料，就是他进来时那个宪兵给他的。 </p> 
<p>“我叫爱德蒙·唐太斯，”青年镇定地回答说，“我是法老号船上的大副，那条船属于摩来尔父子公司所有。” </p> 
<p>“你的年龄”维尔福又问。“十九岁”唐太斯回答。 </p> 
<p>“你被捕的时候在干什么？” </p> 
<p>“我是在请人吃喜酒，先生。”青年人说着，他的声音有点儿微微颤抖，刚才那个快乐的时刻与现在这种痛苦的经历对照起来，差别实在是太大了，而维尔福先生阴沉的脸色和唐太斯满脸红光对照起来，也实在是反差太大了。“你在请人吃喜酒？”代理检察官问道，不由自主地打了个寒噤。 </p> 
<p>“是的，先生，我正要娶一位我爱了三年的姑娘。”维尔福虽然仍面不改色，但却为这个巧合吃了一惊。唐太斯颤抖的声音告诉他在他的胸膛里引起了一阵同情的共鸣。唐太斯是在他的幸福时刻被人召来的，而他自己也快要结婚了，他也是在自己的幸福时刻被人召来的，而他又是来破坏另一个人的幸福的。这种哲学上的相似之处，，在圣·梅朗侯爵家里倒是一个极好的话题，大谈而特谈一通。他这样想着，当唐太斯等待他往下问的时候，他起码在整理着他的思绪，他越想越觉得这是很好的对称话题，而演说家们往往用对称话题来获得雄辨之誉，当这篇演讲整理好之后，维尔福想到他可能产生的效果，不禁微笑了一下，然后他，转过来向唐太斯说“往下说，先生。” </p> 
<p>“您让我继续说些什么？” </p> 
<p>“把你知道的一切都讲出来。” </p> 
<p>“告诉我您要知道哪一方面的事情，这样我才可以把我所知道的一切都讲出来。”只是，他苦笑了一下，又说，“我得事先告诉您，我知道的很少。” </p> 
<p>“你有没有在逆贼手下服务过？” </p> 
<p>“我刚编入皇家海军的时候，他就倒台了。” </p> 
<p>“有人报告说，你政见很极端。”维尔福说，其实他根本没听说过这类事，但他偏要这么一提，就如同提出一项指控一样。 </p> 
<p>“我的政见！我！”唐太斯问道，“唉，先生，我从来没有什么政见，我还没满１９岁，我什么都不知道，我起不了什么作用，假如我得到了我所希望的那个职位，应该归功莫雷尔先生，所以，我的全部见解——我不说政见，而只是私人见解——不出这三个范围：我亲爱的父亲，我尊敬的莫雷尔先生，我喜欢的美茜蒂丝。先生，这就是我所能告诉您的一切，您瞧，对这些事您不会感兴趣的。” </p> 
<p>唐太斯说话时，维尔福一直注视着他那温和而开朗的脸，耳边也似乎响起了蕾妮的话，蕾妮虽不认识这个嫌疑犯，但却替他求过情，请求他宽大处理，代理检察官根据案例和对犯人的审理来看，这个青年所说的每一字都愈来愈使他相信他是无辜的。这个孩子，——因为他还说不上是个成年人——单纯，自然说话时理直气壮充分显示出了他内心的坦然，他对每一个人都抱着好感，因为他很幸福。而即使在幸福产生了恶果的时候，他甚至还这般和蔼可亲，尽管维尔福装出一副可畏的目光和严厉的口吻。 </p> 
<p>“没错，”维尔福心想，“他是一个可爱的小伙子！看来我不难讨好蕾妮了，完成她第一次请求我做的事，这样我可以在公开场合吻她的手，还可以私下里讨一个甜蜜的吻”脑子里充满了这种想法，维尔福的脸也变得开朗起来了，所以当他转向唐太斯的时候，后者也注意到他脸色的改变，也微笑起来。 </p> 
<p>“先生”维尔福说，“你知不知道你有什么仇人吗？” </p> 
<p>“我有仇人？”唐太斯答道，“我的地位还不够那种资格。至于我自己的脾气，或许是有点急躁了，但我一直在努力地改正。我手下有十二三个水手，如果你问他们，他们会告诉您的，他们喜欢我尊敬我，把我看成是长兄一般，我不敢说敬我如父，因为我太年轻了。” </p> 
<p>“即使没有仇人，或许有人嫉妒你，你才１９岁就要做船长了——这对你来说算是一个很好的职位。你又要和一个爱你的姑娘结婚了，这两桩运气的事或许已引起另外一个人的嫉妒哩。” </p> 
<p>“您说的对。您对人们的了解比我深刻的多，我承认，您所说的这种事可能是存在的，但假如这些嫉妒的人是我的朋友，那我宁愿不知道他们，免得对他们产生仇恨。” </p> 
<p>“你错了，你应该随时尽可能地看清你周围的环境。你看来倒象是一个可敬的青年，我愿意破例帮你查出那个写这封信的发信人。信就在这儿，你认识这笔迹吗？”维尔福一边说一边从他的口袋里拿出了那封信，递给了唐太斯，唐太斯看完信。一片疑云浮上了他的眉头，他说；“不，先生，我不认识这笔迹，这是伪装过的，可是写的很流利。不管是谁写的，写这信的人很灵巧。”他感激地望着维尔福说：“我很幸运，能遇到象您这样的人来审问我。至于这个嫉妒我的人，倒真是个仇人。”从那青年人眼里射出来的急速的一瞥，维尔福看出来在温和的表面下蕴含着惊人的力量。 </p> 
<p>“现在，”代理检察官说：“坦白的告诉我——不是一个犯人面对法官，而是一个受委屈的孩子面对关心他的人。——这封匿名的告发信里究竟有多少是实情？”于是，维尔福把唐太斯刚才还给他的那封信轻蔑地扔在了他的办公桌上。 </p> 
<p>“没有一点儿是真的。我可以把实情告诉您。我以水手的名誉，以我对美塞苔丝的爱，以我父亲的生命向你发誓——” </p> 
<p>“说吧，先生，”维尔福说。然后，心想假如蕾妮看到我这个样子和场合，她一定很满意，一定不会再叫我刽子手了。 </p> 
<p>“唔，我们离开那不勒斯以后，莱克勒船长就突然得到了脑膜炎。我们船上没有医生，而他又急于要到爱尔巴去，所以沿途没有停靠任何港口。他的脑子愈来愈不清楚了，在第三天，快要过去的时候，他知道自己快不行了，就叫我到他那儿去。‘我亲爱的唐太斯，’他说，‘我要你发誓完成我将要你做的这件事，因为这是一件非常重要的大事。’“‘我发誓，船长，’我回答说。 </p> 
<p>“‘好，你是大副，我死后，这条船由你来指挥，把船驶向厄尔巴岛去，在费拉约岛靠岸，然后去找大元帅。把这封信交给他。也许他们会另外给你一封信，叫你当次信差。你一定要完成这本来应该是我去做的事，并享受它所带来的一切荣誉和利益。 </p> 
<p>“‘我一定照办，船长，但也许我去见大元帅时不象您预期的那样顺利，万一不让我见到他呢？’“‘这儿有一只戒指拿着他求见，就不会有问题了，船长说完就给了我这只戒指，他交给我的正是时候，两个小时后，他就昏迷不醒，第二天，他就去世了。’” </p> 
<p>“你当时怎么办了？” </p> 
<p>“我做了我应该做的事，不论谁处在我的位置上，他都会那样做的，不论在那里，一个人快要死的时候，他的最后请求，都是神圣的，对一个水手来说，他的上司最后的请求就是命令。我向厄尔巴岛驶去，第二天就到了。我命令所有的人都留在船上，而我自己一个人上岸去了，不出我所料，我想见大元帅却遇到了一些麻烦，我把船长交给我的那个戒指拿了出来，元帅看过之后，马上就获准了。他问了一些关于莱克勒船长去世的事。而且，正如船长所说的的那样，大元帅给了我一封信，要我带去给一个住在巴黎的人。我接过了那封信，因为这是船长命令我这样做的事。我在此地靠岸，安排了船上的事，就赶快去看我的未婚妻了，我发现她更可爱，比以前更爱我了。但得谢谢莫雷尔先生，一切手续都在以前办好了，一句话，很顺利再就是我请人吃喜酒了。再过一个小时，我就已经结婚了，我本来是预备明天动身到巴黎去的，由于这次告密，我就被捕了，我看您现在和我一样，是很鄙视这次告密的。” </p> 
<p>“是的，”维尔福说，“看来这象是实事，既使你有错，也只能算是疏忽罪，而且即然是奉了你船长的命令，这种疏忽罪就不算什么了，你把从厄尔巴岛带来的这封信交给我们，记下你的话，然后回到你的朋友那里去吧，需要你的时候，你再来。” </p> 
<p>“那么，我是自由的了，先生？”唐太斯高兴地喊到。 </p> 
<p>“是的，你得先把那封信给我。” </p> 
<p>“已经在您这儿了，他们已早从我身上把它搜去了，还有其它的信，我看到都在那包东西里面。 </p> 
<p>“等一等，”正当唐太斯去拿他的帽子和手套时，代理法官叫住了他，那封信是写给谁的。” </p> 
<p>“是给诺瓦蒂埃先生的，地址是巴黎高海隆路。” </p> 
<p>即使是一个霹雷炸响，也未必能使他维尔福如此震惊，如此的意外，悴不及防，他倒在椅子里，匆忙地翻着他的口袋，带着恐怖的神色盯着它。 </p> 
<p>“高海隆路１３号诺瓦蒂埃先生收。”他轻声地念着，脸色变的十分苍白。 </p> 
<p>“是的，”唐太斯说，他也吃了一惊，，“难道您认识他吗？” </p> 
<p>“不，”维尔福急忙回答，‘国王忠实的奴仆是不认识叛匪的。’“那么说，这是个谋反案了吧？”唐太斯问，他本以为自己获得了自由，但现在比以前更加惊惶了，“但是，我已经对您说过，先生，我对信的内容，是一点也不知道的。” </p> 
<p>“不错，但你知道收信人的名子。”维尔福说。 </p> 
<p>“我要去送信，就不得不知道那个人的地址。” </p> 
<p>“这封信你有没有给别人看过？”维尔福问，脸色变得越来越苍白了。 </p> 
<p>“没有，我可以发誓。” </p> 
<p>“没有人知道你从厄尔巴岛带一封信给诺瓦蒂埃先生吗？” </p> 
<p>“除了给我这封信的人外，没有人知道！” </p> 
<p>“这就够了，”维尔福轻声地说，他的脸色越来越沉着，他这种神态使唐太斯满心疑惧。 </p> 
<p>维尔福读完这封信，低下了头，并用双手遮住了他的脸。 </p> 
<p>“噢，怎么回事？”唐太斯胆怯地问。维尔福没有回答，只是抬起头来嘘了一口气，又继续读那封信。 </p> 
<p>“你能向我发誓，说绝对不知道这封信的内容吗？” </p> 
<p>“我向您发誓，先生，到底是怎么一回事？您是病了吧，我拉铃叫人来帮忙好吧？”唐太斯说。 </p> 
<p>“不，你不要动，这儿发命令的是我，而不是你！”维尔福站起来说。 </p> 
<p>“先生，我是叫人来照顾您，您好像是病了。” </p> 
<p>“不，我不需要，只是一时的不舒服罢了，还是当心儿你自己吧，别管我，回答我提出的问题！” </p> 
<p>但他什么也没有提，只是回到了椅子上，用手抹了一下他那大汗淋淋的额头，第三次读了那封信。“噢，如果他知道了内容，”他轻声地说，“那他就完了，而且知道诺瓦蒂埃就是维尔福的父亲，那我也就完了！”他用眼睛盯着爱德蒙，唐太斯好象要看穿他的心思似的。 </p> 
<p>“哦，用不着再怀疑了，他肯定已经知道了一切。”他突然大声喊。 </p> 
<p>“天哪，”那不幸的青年说，“假如您怀疑我，问我吧，我可以答应您的。” </p> 
<p>维尔福费了好大的劲，极力想使自己镇定下来，他说，“先生，这次审问的结果是你的罪名严重，我无法象刚才希望的那样立刻给你自由了。在做出这样的规定前，我必须先去同预审官商量一下，但我对你的态度如何，你是知道的。” </p> 
<p>“噢，先生，”唐太斯说，“您刚才待我象兄弟，是一个朋友，而不象是一个法官。” </p> 
<p>“那好，我要再耽搁你一会的时间，但我会尽可能使时间缩短，你主要的罪状是这封信，你看——”维尔福走近壁炉，把信投进了火里，直等到它完全烧荆“你看，我销毁了它。” </p> 
<p>“噢，您太公正了，简直是太好了。”唐太斯说道。 </p> 
<p>“听着，你刚才看见我所做的事了吧，现在可以相信我了吧，信任我了吧！”维尔福对他说。 </p> 
<p>“是的，请您吩咐我吧，我一定遵命。” </p> 
<p>“今晚之前，我得把你扣留在法院里，假如有谁来审问你，对于这封信你一定不要提。” </p> 
<p>“我答应。” </p> 
<p>现在看来倒好象是维尔福在求情，而犯人在安慰他了。你看，他说，“信是销毁了，只有你和我知道有这么一封信。所以，要是有人问到你，你就根本否认有这么一回事。” </p> 
<p>“放心，我一定否认的。” </p> 
<p>“你只有这一封信？” </p> 
<p>“是的。” </p> 
<p>“你发誓，” </p> 
<p>“我发誓！” </p> 
<p>维尔福拉响了铃，警长走进来，维尔福在他的耳边低声说了几句话，警长点点头会意。 </p> 
<p>“跟他去吧。”维尔福对唐太斯说。唐太斯向维尔福感激地行了个礼，就走出去了。他身后的门还没有完全关上，维尔福已经精疲力尽了，他再也支持不住了，昏昏沉沉地躺在了一张椅子上。 </p> 
<p>过了一会他喃喃地说：“啊，我的上帝，假如检察官此时在马赛，假如刚才不是叫我，而是找到了预审法官，那可就全完了，这封告发信，差点把我打入十八层地狱。噢，我的父亲，难道你过去的行为，将永远阻碍我的成功吗？”突然他的脸上掠过了一丝微笑，他那犹豫的眼光变得坚定了起来，他似乎全神贯注地在盘算着一个想法。 </p> 
<p>“这个办法很好，”他说，“这封信本来就是使我完蛋的，它也许会使我飞黄腾达起来的。”他四周看了看，确信犯人已经离开以后，代理检察官就赶快向他新娘的家里走去了。</p>
