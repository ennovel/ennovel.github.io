Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winklelistened with gloomy respect to the torrent of eloquence whichtheir leader poured forth from the sedan-chair, and the rapidcourse of which not all Mr. Tupman’s earnest entreaties to havethe lid of the vehicle closed, were able to check for an instant. ButMr. Weller’s anger quickly gave way to curiosity when theprocession turned down the identical courtyard in which he hadmet with the runaway Job Trotter; and curiosity was exchangedfor a feeling of the most gleeful astonishment, when the all-important Mr. Grummer, commanding the sedan-bearers to halt,advanced with dignified and portentous steps to the very greengate from which Job Trotter had emerged, and gave a mighty pullat the bell-handle which hung at the side thereof. The ring wasanswered by a very smart and pretty-faced servant-girl, who, afterholding up her hands in astonishment at the rebelliousappearance of the prisoners, and the impassioned language of Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick, summoned Mr. Muzzle. Mr. Muzzle opened one half ofthe carriage gate, to admit the sedan, the captured ones, and thespecials; and immediately slammed it in the faces of the mob, who,indignant at being excluded, and anxious to see what followed,relieved their feelings by kicking at the gate and ringing the bell,for an hour or two afterwards. In this amusement they all tookpart by turns, except three or four fortunate individuals, who,having discovered a grating in the gate, which commanded a viewof nothing, stared through it with the indefatigable perseverancewith which people will flatten their noses against the frontwindows of a chemist’s shop, when a drunken man, who has beenrun over by a dog-cart in the street, is undergoing a surgicalinspection in the back-parlour.</p> 
<p>　　At the foot of a flight of steps, leading to the house door, whichwas guarded on either side by an American aloe in a green tub,the sedan-chair stopped. Mr. Pickwick and his friends wereconducted into the hall, whence, having been previouslyannounced by Muzzle, and ordered in by Mr. Nupkins, they wereushered into the worshipful presence of that public-spiritedofficer.</p> 
<p>　　The scene was an impressive one, well calculated to striketerror to the hearts of culprits, and to impress them with anadequate idea of the stern majesty of the law. In front of a bigbook-case, in a big chair, behind a big table, and before a bigvolume, sat Mr. Nupkins, looking a full size larger than any one ofthem, big as they were. The table was adorned with piles ofpapers; and above the farther end of it, appeared the head andshoulders of Mr. Jinks, who was busily engaged in looking as busyas possible. The party having all entered, Muzzle carefully closedthe door, and placed himself behind his master’s chair to await hisorders. Mr. Nupkins threw himself back with thrilling solemnity,and scrutinised the faces of his unwilling visitors.</p> 
<p>　　‘Now, Grummer, who is that person?’ said Mr. Nupkins,pointing to Mr. Pickwick, who, as the spokesman of his friends,stood hat in hand, bowing with the utmost politeness and respect.</p> 
<p>　　‘This here’s Pickvick, your wash-up,’ said Grummer.</p> 
<p>　　‘Come, none o’ that ’ere, old Strike-a-light,’ interposed Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Weller, elbowing himself into the front rank. ‘Beg your pardon, sir,but this here officer o’ yourn in the gambooge tops, ’ull never earna decent livin’ as a master o’ the ceremonies any vere. This here,sir’ continued Mr. Weller, thrusting Grummer aside, andaddressing the magistrate with pleasant familiarity, ‘this here is S.</p> 
<p>　　Pickvick, Esquire; this here’s Mr. Tupman; that ’ere’s Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Snodgrass; and farder on, next him on the t’other side, Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Winkle―all wery nice gen’l’m’n, sir, as you’ll be wery happy tohave the acquaintance on; so the sooner you commits these hereofficers o’ yourn to the tread―mill for a month or two, the soonerwe shall begin to be on a pleasant understanding. Business first,pleasure arterwards, as King Richard the Third said when hestabbed the t’other king in the Tower, afore he smothered thebabbies.’</p> 
<p>　　At the conclusion of this address, Mr. Weller brushed his hatwith his right elbow, and nodded benignly to Jinks, who had heardhim throughout with unspeakable awe.</p> 
<p>　　‘Who is this man, Grummer?’ said the magistrate,.</p> 
<p>　　‘Wery desp’rate ch’racter, your wash-up,’ replied Grummer. ‘Heattempted to rescue the prisoners, and assaulted the officers; sowe took him into custody, and brought him here.’</p> 
<p>　　‘You did quite right,’ replied the magistrate. ‘He is evidently adesperate ruffian.’</p> 
<p>　　‘He is my servant, sir,’ said Mr. Pickwick angrily.</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh! he is your servant, is he?’ said Mr. Nupkins. ‘A conspiracyto defeat the ends of justice, and murder its officers. Pickwick’sservant. Put that down, Mr. Jinks.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Jinks did so.</p> 
<p>　　‘What’s your name, fellow?’ thundered Mr. Nupkins.</p> 
<p>　　‘Veller,’ replied Sam.</p> 
<p>　　‘A very good name for the Newgate Calendar,’ said Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Nupkins.</p> 
<p>　　This was a joke; so Jinks, Grummer, Dubbley, all the specials,and Muzzle, went into fits of laughter of five minutes’ duration.</p> 
<p>　　‘Put down his name, Mr. Jinks,’ said the magistrate.</p> 
<p>　　‘Two L’s, old feller,’ said Sam.</p> 
<p>　　Here an unfortunate special laughed again, whereupon themagistrate threatened to commit him instantly. It is a dangerousthing to laugh at the wrong man, in these cases.</p> 
<p>　　‘Where do you live?’ said the magistrate.</p> 
<p>　　‘Vere ever I can,’ replied Sam.</p> 
<p>　　‘Put down that, Mr. Jinks,’ said the magistrate, who was fastrising into a rage.</p> 
<p>　　‘Score it under,’ said Sam.</p> 
<p>　　‘He is a vagabond, Mr. Jinks,’ said the magistrate. ‘He is avagabond on his own statement,―is he not, Mr. Jinks?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Certainly, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Then I’ll commit him―I’ll commit him as such,’ said Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Nupkins.</p> 
<p>　　‘This is a wery impartial country for justice, ‘said Sam.’Thereain’t a magistrate goin’ as don’t commit himself twice as hecommits other people.’</p> 
<p>　　At this sally another special laughed, and then tried to look sosupernaturally solemn, that the magistrate detected himimmediately.</p> 
<p>　　‘Grummer,’ said Mr. Nupkins, reddening with passion, ‘howdare you select such an inefficient and disreputable person for aspecial constable, as that man? How dare you do it, sir?’</p> 
<p>　　‘I am very sorry, your wash-up,’ stammered Grummer.</p> 
<p>　　‘Very sorry!’ said the furious magistrate. ‘You shall repent ofthis neglect of duty, Mr. Grummer; you shall be made an exampleof. Take that fellow’s staff away. He’s drunk. You’re drunk, fellow.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I am not drunk, your Worship,’ said the man.</p> 
<p>　　‘You are drunk,’ returned the magistrate. ‘How dare you sayyou are not drunk, sir, when I say you are? Doesn’t he smell ofspirits, Grummer?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Horrid, your wash-up,’ replied Grummer, who had a vagueimpression that there was a smell of rum somewhere.</p> 
<p>　　‘I knew he did,’ said Mr. Nupkins. ‘I saw he was drunk when hefirst came into the room, by his excited eye. Did you observe hisexcited eye, Mr. Jinks?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Certainly, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I haven’t touched a drop of spirits this morning,’ said the man,who was as sober a fellow as need be.</p> 
<p>　　‘How dare you tell me a falsehood?’ said Mr. Nupkins. ‘Isn’t hedrunk at this moment, Mr. Jinks?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Certainly, sir,’ replied Jinks.</p> 
<p>　　‘Mr. Jinks,’ said the magistrate, ‘I shall commit that man forcontempt. Make out his committal, Mr. Jinks.’</p> 
<p>　　And committed the special would have been, only Jinks, whowas the magistrate’s adviser (having had a legal education of threeyears in a country attorney’s office), whispered the magistrate thathe thought it wouldn’t do; so the magistrate made a speech, andsaid, that in consideration of the special’s family, he would merelyreprimand and discharge him. Accordingly, the special wasabused, vehemently, for a quarter of an hour, and sent about hisbusiness; and Grummer, Dubbley, Muzzle, and all the otherspecials, murmured their admiration of the magnanimity of Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Nupkins.</p> 
<p>　　‘Now, Mr. Jinks,’ said the magistrate, ‘swear Grummer.’</p> 
<p>　　Grummer was sworn directly; but as Grummer wandered, andMr. Nupkins’s dinner was nearly ready, Mr. Nupkins cut thematter short, by putting leading questions to Grummer, whichGrummer answered as nearly in the affirmative as he could. Sothe examination went off, all very smooth and comfortable, andtwo assaults were proved against Mr. Weller, and a threat againstMr. Winkle, and a push against Mr. Snodgrass. When all this wasdone to the magistrate’s satisfaction, the magistrate and Mr. Jinksconsulted in whispers.</p> 
<p>　　The consultation having lasted about ten minutes, Mr. Jinksretired to his end of the table; and the magistrate, with apreparatory cough, drew himself up in his chair, and wasproceeding to commence his address, when Mr. Pickwickinterposed.</p> 
<p>　　‘I beg your pardon, sir, for interrupting you,’ said Mr. Pickwick;‘but before you proceed to express, and act upon, any opinion youmay have formed on the statements which have been made here, Imust claim my right to be heard so far as I am personallyconcerned.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Hold your tongue, sir,’ said the magistrate peremptorily.</p> 
<p>　　‘I must submit to you, sir―’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Hold your tongue, sir,’ interposed the magistrate, ‘or I shallorder an officer to remove you.’</p> 
<p>　　‘You may order your officers to do whatever you please, sir,’</p> 
<p>　　said Mr. Pickwick; ‘and I have no doubt, from the specimen I havehad of the subordination preserved amongst them, that whateveryou order, they will execute, sir; but I shall take the liberty, sir, ofclaiming my right to be heard, until I am removed by force.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Pickvick and principle!’ exclaimed Mr. Weller, in a veryaudible voice.</p> 
<p>　　‘Sam, be quiet,’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Dumb as a drum vith a hole in it, sir,’ replied Sam.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Nupkins looked at Mr. Pickwick with a gaze of intenseastonishment, at his displaying such unwonted temerity; and wasapparently about to return a very angry reply, when Mr. Jinkspulled him by the sleeve, and whispered something in his ear. Tothis, the magistrate returned a half-audible answer, and then thewhispering was renewed. Jinks was evidently remonstrating. Atlength the magistrate, gulping down, with a very bad grace, hisdisinclination to hear anything more, turned to Mr. Pickwick, andsaid sharply, ‘What do you want to say?’</p> 
<p>　　‘First,’ said Mr. Pickwick, sending a look through his spectacles,under which even Nupkins quailed, ‘first, I wish to know what Iand my friend have been brought here for?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Must I tell him?’ whispered the magistrate to Jinks.</p> 
<p>　　‘I think you had better, sir,’ whispered Jinks to the magistrate.</p> 
<p>　　‘An information has been sworn before me,’ said the magistrate,‘that it is apprehended you are going to fight a duel, and that theother man, Tupman, is your aider and abettor in it. Therefore―eh,Mr. Jinks?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Certainly, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Therefore, I call upon you both, to―I think that’s the course,Mr. Jinks?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Certainly, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘To―to―what, Mr. Jinks?’ said the magistrate pettishly.</p> 
<p>　　‘To find bail, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes. Therefore, I call upon you both―as I was about to saywhen I was interrupted by my clerk―to find bail.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Good bail,’ whispered Mr. Jinks.</p> 
<p>　　‘I shall require good bail,’ said the magistrate.</p> 
<p>　　‘Town’s-people,’ whispered Jinks.</p> 
<p>　　‘They must be townspeople,’ said the magistrate.</p> 
<p>　　‘Fifty pounds each,’ whispered Jinks, ‘and householders, ofcourse.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I shall require two sureties of fifty pounds each,’ said themagistrate aloud, with great dignity, ‘and they must behouseholders, of course.’</p> 
<p>　　‘But bless my heart, sir,’ said Mr. Pickwick, who, together withMr. Tupman, was all amazement and indignation; ‘we are perfectstrangers in this town. I have as little knowledge of anyhouseholders here, as I have intention of fighting a duel withanybody.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I dare say,’ replied the magistrate, ‘I dare say―don’t you, Mr.</p> 
<p>　　‘Certainly, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Have you anything more to say?’ inquired the magistrate.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick had a great deal more to say, which he would nodoubt have said, very little to his own advantage, or themagistrate’s satisfaction, if he had not, the moment he ceasedspeaking, been pulled by the sleeve by Mr. Weller, with whom hewas immediately engaged in so earnest a conversation, that hesuffered the magistrate’s inquiry to pass wholly unnoticed. Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Nupkins was not the man to ask a question of the kind twice over;and so, with another preparatory cough, he proceeded, amidst thereverential and admiring silence of the constables, to pronouncehis decision. He should fine Weller two pounds for the first assault,and three pounds for the second. He should fine Winkle twopounds, and Snodgrass one pound, besides requiring them toenter into their own recognisances to keep the peace towards allhis Majesty’s subjects, and especially towards his liege servant,Daniel Grummer. Pickwick and Tupman he had already held tobail.</p> 
<p>　　Immediately on the magistrate ceasing to speak, Mr. Pickwick,with a smile mantling on his again good-humoured countenance,stepped forward, and said―‘I beg the magistrate’s pardon, but may I request a few minutes’</p> 
<p>　　private conversation with him, on a matter of deep importance tohimself?’</p> 
<p>　　‘What?’ said the magistrate. Mr. Pickwick repeated his request.</p> 
<p>　　‘This is a most extraordinary request,’ said the magistrate. ‘Aprivate interview?’</p> 
<p>　　‘A private interview,’ replied Mr. Pickwick firmly; ‘only, as apart of the information which I wish to communicate is derivedfrom my servant, I should wish him to be present.’</p> 
<p>　　The magistrate looked at Mr. Jinks; Mr. Jinks looked at themagistrate; the officers looked at each other in amazement. Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Nupkins turned suddenly pale. Could the man Weller, in amoment of remorse, have divulged some secret conspiracy for hisassassination? It was a dreadful thought. He was a public man;and he turned paler, as he thought of Julius Caesar and Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Perceval.</p> 
<p>　　The magistrate looked at Mr. Pickwick again, and beckoned Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Jinks.</p> 
<p>　　‘What do you think of this request, Mr. Jinks?’ murmured Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Nupkins.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Jinks, who didn’t exactly know what to think of it, and wasafraid he might offend, smiled feebly, after a dubious fashion, and,screwing up the corners of his mouth, shook his head slowly fromside to side.</p> 
<p>　　‘Mr. Jinks,’ said the magistrate gravely, ‘you are an ass.’</p> 
<p>　　At this little expression of opinion, Mr. Jinks smiled again―rather more feebly than before―and edged himself, by degrees,back into his own corner.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Nupkins debated the matter within himself for a fewseconds, and then, rising from his chair, and requesting Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick and Sam to follow him, led the way into a small roomwhich opened into the justice-parlour. Desiring Mr. Pickwick towalk to the upper end of the little apartment, and holding his handupon the half-closed door, that he might be able to effect animmediate escape, in case there was the least tendency to adisplay of hostilities, Mr. Nupkins expressed his readiness to hearthe communication, whatever it might be.</p> 
<p>　　‘I will come to the point at once, sir,’ said Mr. Pickwick; ‘itaffects yourself and your credit materially. I have every reason tobelieve, sir, that you are harbouring in your house a grossimpostor!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Two,’ interrupted Sam. ‘Mulberry agin all natur, for tears andwillainny!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘if I am to render myself intelligible tothis gentleman, I must beg you to control your feelings.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Wery sorry, sir,’ replied Mr. Weller; ‘but when I think o’ that’ere Job, I can’t help opening the walve a inch or two.’</p> 
<p>　　‘In one word, sir,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘is my servant right insuspecting that a certain Captain Fitz-Marshall is in the habit ofvisiting here? Because,’ added Mr. Pickwick, as he saw that Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Nupkins was about to offer a very indignant interruption, ‘becauseif he be, I know that person to be a―’</p> 
<p>　　‘Hush, hush,’ said Mr. Nupkins, closing the door. ‘Know him tobe what, sir?’</p> 
<p>　　‘An unprincipled adventurer―a dishonourable character―aman who preys upon society, and makes easily-deceived peoplehis dupes, sir; his absurd, his foolish, his wretched dupes, sir,’ saidthe excited Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Dear me,’ said Mr. Nupkins, turning very red, and altering hiswhole manner directly. ‘Dear me, Mr.―’</p> 
<p>　　‘Pickvick,’ said Sam.</p> 
<p>　　‘Pickwick,’ said the magistrate, ‘dear me, Mr. Pickwick―praytake a seat―you cannot mean this? Captain Fitz-Marshall!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Don’t call him a cap’en,’ said Sam, ‘nor Fitz-Marshall neither;he ain’t neither one nor t’other. He’s a strolling actor, he is, and hisname’s Jingle; and if ever there was a wolf in a mulberry suit, that’ere Job Trotter’s him.’</p> 
<p>　　‘It is very true, sir,’ said Mr. Pickwick, replying to themagistrate’s look of amazement; ‘my only business in this town, isto expose the person of whom we now speak.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick proceeded to pour into the horror-stricken ear ofMr. Nupkins, an abridged account of all Mr. Jingle’s atrocities. Herelated how he had first met him; how he had eloped with MissWardle; how he had cheerfully resigned the lady for a pecuniaryconsideration; how he had entrapped himself into a lady’sboarding-school at midnight; and how he (Mr. Pickwick) now feltit his duty to expose his assumption of his present name and rank.</p> 
<p>　　As the narrative proceeded, all the warm blood in the body ofMr. Nupkins tingled up into the very tips of his ears. He hadpicked up the captain at a neighbouring race-course. Charmedwith his long list of aristocratic acquaintance, his extensive travel,and his fashionable demeanour, Mrs. Nupkins and Miss Nupkinshad exhibited Captain Fitz-Marshall, and quoted Captain Fitz-Marshall, and hurled Captain Fitz-Marshall at the devoted headsof their select circle of acquaintance, until their bosom friends,Mrs. Porkenham and the Misses Porkenhams, and Mr. SidneyPorkenham, were ready to burst with jealousy and despair. Andnow, to hear, after all, that he was a needy adventurer, a strollingplayer, and if not a swindler, something so very like it, that it washard to tell the difference! Heavens! what would the Porkenhamssay! What would be the triumph of Mr. Sidney Porkenham whenhe found that his addresses had been slighted for such a rival!</p> 
<p>　　How should he, Nupkins, meet the eye of old Porkenham at thenext quarter-sessions! And what a handle would it be for theopposition magisterial party if the story got abroad!</p> 
<p>　　‘But after all,’ said Mr. Nupkins, brightening for a moment,after a long pause; ‘after all, this is a mere statement. Captain Fitz-Marshall is a man of very engaging manners, and, I dare say, hasmany enemies. What proof have you of the truth of theserepresentations?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Confront me with him,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘that is all I ask, andall I require. Confront him with me and my friends here; you willwant no further proof.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Why,’ said Mr. Nupkins, ‘that might be very easily done, for hewill be here to-night, and then there would be no occasion to makethe matter public, just―just―for the young man’s own sake, youknow. I―I―should like to consult Mrs. Nupkins on the proprietyof the step, in the first instance, though. At all events, Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick, we must despatch this legal business before we can doanything else. Pray step back into the next room.’</p> 
<p>　　Into the next room they went.</p> 
<p>　　‘Grummer,’ said the magistrate, in an awful voice.</p> 
<p>　　‘Your wash-up,’ replied Grummer, with the smile of a favourite.</p> 
<p>　　‘Come, come, sir,’ said the magistrate sternly, ‘don’t let me seeany of this levity here. It is very unbecoming, and I can assure youthat you have very little to smile at. Was the account you gave mejust now strictly true? Now be careful, sir!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Your wash-up,’ stammered Grummer, ‘I―’</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh, you are confused, are you?’ said the magistrate. ‘Mr. Jinks,you observe this confusion?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Certainly, sir,’ replied Jinks.</p> 
<p>　　‘Now,’ said the magistrate, ‘repeat your statement, Grummer,and again I warn you to be careful. Mr. Jinks, take his wordsdown.’</p> 
<p>　　The unfortunate Grummer proceeded to re-state his complaint,but, what between Mr. Jinks’s taking down his words, and themagistrate’s taking them up, his natural tendency to rambling,and his extreme confusion, he managed to get involved, insomething under three minutes, in such a mass of entanglementand contradiction, that Mr. Nupkins at once declared he didn’tbelieve him. So the fines were remitted, and Mr. Jinks found acouple of bail in no time. And all these solemn proceedings havingbeen satisfactorily concluded, Mr. Grummer was ignominiouslyordered out―an awful instance of the instability of humangreatness, and the uncertain tenure of great men’s favour.</p> 
<p>　　Mrs. Nupkins was a majestic female in a pink gauze turban anda light brown wig. Miss Nupkins possessed all her mamma’shaughtiness without the turban, and all her ill-nature without thewig; and whenever the exercise of these two amiable qualitiesinvolved mother and daughter in some unpleasant dilemma, asthey not infrequently did, they both concurred in laying the blameon the shoulders of Mr. Nupkins. Accordingly, when Mr. Nupkinssought Mrs. Nupkins, and detailed the communication which hadbeen made by Mr. Pickwick, Mrs. Nupkins suddenly recollectedthat she had always expected something of the kind; that she hadalways said it would be so; that her advice was never taken; thatshe really did not know what Mr. Nupkins supposed she was; andso forth.</p> 
<p>　　‘The idea!’ said Miss Nupkins, forcing a tear of very scantyproportions into the corner of each eye; ‘the idea of my beingmade such a fool of!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Ah! you may thank your papa, my dear,’ said Mrs. Nupkins;‘how I have implored and begged that man to inquire into thecaptain’s family connections; how I have urged and entreated himto take some decisive step! I am quite certain nobody wouldbelieve it―quite.’</p> 
<p>　　‘But, my dear,’ said Mr. Nupkins.</p> 
<p>　　‘Don’t talk to me, you aggravating thing, don’t!’ said Mrs.</p> 
<p>　　Nupkins.</p> 
<p>　　‘My love,’ said Mr. Nupkins, ‘you professed yourself very fond ofCaptain Fitz-Marshall. You have constantly asked him here, mydear, and you have lost no opportunity of introducing himelsewhere.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Didn’t I say so, Henrietta?’ cried Mrs. Nupkins, appealing toher daughter with the air of a much-injured female. ‘Didn’t I saythat your papa would turn round and lay all this at my door?</p> 
<p>　　Didn’t I say so?’ Here Mrs. Nupkins sobbed.</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh, pa!’ remonstrated Miss Nupkins. And here she sobbed too.</p> 
<p>　　‘Isn’t it too much, when he has brought all this disgrace andridicule upon us, to taunt me with being the cause of it?’</p> 
<p>　　exclaimed Mrs. Nupkins.</p> 
<p>　　‘How can we ever show ourselves in society!’ said MissNupkins.</p> 
<p>　　‘How can we face the Porkenhams?’ cried Mrs. Nupkins.</p> 
<p>　　‘Or the Griggs!’ cried Miss Nupkins. ‘Or the Slummintowkens!’</p> 
<p>　　cried Mrs. Nupkins. ‘But what does your papa care! What is it tohim!’ At this dreadful reflection, Mrs. Nupkins wept mentalanguish, and Miss Nupkins followed on the same side.</p> 
<p>　　Mrs. Nupkins’s tears continued to gush forth, with greatvelocity, until she had gained a little time to think the matter over;when she decided, in her own mind, that the best thing to dowould be to ask Mr. Pickwick and his friends to remain until thecaptain’s arrival, and then to give Mr. Pickwick the opportunity hesought. If it appeared that he had spoken truly, the captain couldbe turned out of the house without noising the matter abroad, andthey could easily account to the Porkenhams for hisdisappearance, by saying that he had been appointed, through theCourt influence of his family, to the governor-generalship of SierraLeone, of Saugur Point, or any other of those salubrious climateswhich enchant Europeans so much, that when they once get there,they can hardly ever prevail upon themselves to come back again.</p> 
<p>　　When Mrs. Nupkins dried up her tears, Miss Nupkins dried uphers, and Mr. Nupkins was very glad to settle the matter as Mrs.</p> 
<p>　　Nupkins had proposed. So Mr. Pickwick and his friends, havingwashed off all marks of their late encounter, were introduced tothe ladies, and soon afterwards to their dinner; and Mr. Weller,whom the magistrate, with his peculiar sagacity, had discovered inhalf an hour to be one of the finest fellows alive, was consigned tothe care and guardianship of Mr. Muzzle, who was speciallyenjoined to take him below, and make much of him.</p> 
<p>　　‘How de do, sir?’ said Mr. Muzzle, as he conducted Mr. Wellerdown the kitchen stairs.</p> 
<p>　　‘Why, no considerable change has taken place in the state of mysystem, since I see you cocked up behind your governor’s chair inthe parlour, a little vile ago,’ replied Sam.</p> 
<p>　　‘You will excuse my not taking more notice of you then,’ saidMr. Muzzle. ‘You see, master hadn’t introduced us, then. Lord,how fond he is of you, Mr. Weller, to be sure!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Ah!’ said Sam, ‘what a pleasant chap he is!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Ain’t he?’ replied Mr. Muzzle.</p> 
<p>　　‘So much humour,’ said Sam.</p> 
<p>　　‘And such a man to speak,’ said Mr. Muzzle. ‘How his ideasflow, don’t they?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Wonderful,’ replied Sam; ‘they comes a-pouring out, knockingeach other’s heads so fast, that they seems to stun one another;you hardly know what he’s arter, do you?’</p> 
<p>　　‘That’s the great merit of his style of speaking,’ rejoined Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Muzzle. ‘Take care of the last step, Mr. Weller. Would you like towash your hands, sir, before we join the ladies? Here’s a sink, withthe water laid on, sir, and a clean jack towel behind the door.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Ah! perhaps I may as well have a rinse,’ replied Mr. Weller,applying plenty of yellow soap to the towel, and rubbing away tillhis face shone again. ‘How many ladies are there?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Only two in our kitchen,’ said Mr. Muzzle; ‘cook and ‘ouse-maid. We keep a boy to do the dirty work, and a gal besides, butthey dine in the wash’us.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh, they dines in the wash’us, do they?’ said Mr. Weller.</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes,’ replied Mr. Muzzle, ‘we tried ’em at our table when theyfirst come, but we couldn’t keep ’em. The gal’s manners isdreadful vulgar; and the boy breathes so very hard while he’seating, that we found it impossible to sit at table with him.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Young grampus!’ said Mr. Weller.</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh, dreadful,’ rejoined Mr. Muzzle; ‘but that is the worst ofcountry service, Mr. Weller; the juniors is always so very savage.</p> 
<p>　　This way, sir, if you please, this way.’</p> 
<p>　　Preceding Mr. Weller, with the utmost politeness, Mr. Muzzleconducted him into the kitchen.</p> 
<p>　　‘Mary,’ said Mr. Muzzle to the pretty servant-girl, ‘this is Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Weller; a gentleman as master has sent down, to be made ascomfortable as possible.’</p> 
<p>　　‘And your master’s a knowin’ hand, and has just sent me to theright place,’ said Mr. Weller, with a glance of admiration at Mary.</p> 
<p>　　‘If I wos master o’ this here house, I should alvays find thematerials for comfort vere Mary wos.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Lor, Mr. Weller!’ said Mary blushing.</p> 
<p>　　‘Well, I never!’ ejaculated the cook.</p> 
<p>　　‘Bless me, cook, I forgot you,’ said Mr. Muzzle. ‘Mr. Weller, letme introduce you.’</p> 
<p>　　‘How are you, ma’am?’ said Mr. Weller. ‘Wery glad to see you,indeed, and hope our acquaintance may be a long ’un , as thegen’l’m’n said to the fi’ pun’ note.’</p> 
<p>　　When this ceremony of introduction had been gone through,the cook and Mary retired into the back kitchen to titter, for tenminutes; then returning, all giggles and blushes, they sat down todinner. Mr. Weller’s easy manners and conversational powers hadsuch irresistible influence with his new friends, that before thedinner was half over, they were on a footing of perfect intimacy,and in possession of a full account of the delinquency of JobTrotter.</p> 
<p>　　‘I never could a-bear that Job,’ said Mary.</p> 
<p>　　‘No more you never ought to, my dear,’ replied Mr. Weller.</p> 
<p>　　‘Why not?’ inquired Mary.</p> 
<p>　　‘‘Cos ugliness and svindlin’ never ought to be formiliar withelegance and wirtew,’ replied Mr. Weller. ‘Ought they, Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Muzzle?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Not by no means,’ replied that gentleman.</p> 
<p>　　Here Mary laughed, and said the cook had made her; and thecook laughed, and said she hadn’t.</p> 
<p>　　‘I ha’n’t got a glass,’ said Mary.</p> 
<p>　　‘Drink with me, my dear,’ said Mr. Weller. ‘Put your lips to thishere tumbler, and then I can kiss you by deputy.’</p> 
<p>　　‘For shame, Mr. Weller!’ said Mary.</p> 
<p>　　‘What’s a shame, my dear?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Talkin’ in that way.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Nonsense; it ain’t no harm. It’s natur; ain’t it, cook?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Don’t ask me, imperence,’ replied the cook, in a high state ofdelight; and hereupon the cook and Mary laughed again, till whatbetween the beer, and the cold meat, and the laughter combined,the latter young lady was brought to the verge of choking―analarming crisis from which she was only recovered by sundry patson the back, and other necessary attentions, most delicatelyadministered by Mr. Samuel Weller.</p> 
<p>　　In the midst of all this jollity and conviviality, a loud ring washeard at the garden gate, to which the young gentleman who tookhis meals in the wash-house, immediately responded. Mr. Wellerwas in the height of his attentions to the pretty house-maid; Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Muzzle was busy doing the honours of the table; and the cook hadjust paused to laugh, in the very act of raising a huge morsel to herlips; when the kitchen door opened, and in walked Mr. JobTrotter.</p> 
<p>　　We have said in walked Mr. Job Trotter, but the statement isnot distinguished by our usual scrupulous adherence to fact. Thedoor opened and Mr. Trotter appeared. He would have walked in,and was in the very act of doing so, indeed, when catching sight ofMr. Weller, he involuntarily shrank back a pace or two, and stoodgazing on the unexpected scene before him, perfectly motionlesswith amazement and terror.</p> 
<p>　　‘Here he is!’ said Sam, rising with great glee. ‘Why we were thatwery moment a-speaking o’ you. How are you? Where have youbeen? Come in.’</p> 
<p>　　Laying his hand on the mulberry collar of the unresisting Job,Mr. Weller dragged him into the kitchen; and, locking the door,handed the key to Mr. Muzzle, who very coolly buttoned it up in aside pocket.</p> 
<p>　　‘Well, here’s a game!’ cried Sam. ‘Only think o’ my masterhavin’ the pleasure o’ meeting yourn upstairs, and me havin’ thejoy o’ meetin’ you down here. How are you gettin’ on, and how isthe chandlery bis’ness likely to do? Well, I am so glad to see you.</p> 
<p>　　How happy you look. It’s quite a treat to see you; ain’t it, Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Muzzle?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Quite,’ said Mr. Muzzle.</p> 
<p>　　‘So cheerful he is!’ said Sam.</p> 
<p>　　‘In such good spirits!’ said Muzzle. ‘And so glad to see us―thatmakes it so much more comfortable,’ said Sam. ‘Sit down; sitdown.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Trotter suffered himself to be forced into a chair by thefireside. He cast his small eyes, first on Mr. Weller, and then onMr. Muzzle, but said nothing.</p> 
<p>　　‘Well, now,’ said Sam, ‘afore these here ladies, I should jest liketo ask you, as a sort of curiosity, whether you don’t consideryourself as nice and well-behaved a young gen’l’m’n, as ever useda pink check pocket-handkerchief, and the number fourcollection?’</p> 
<p>　　‘And as was ever a-going to be married to a cook,’ said that ladyindignantly. ‘The willin!’</p> 
<p>　　‘And leave off his evil ways, and set up in the chandlery linearterwards,’ said the housemaid.</p> 
<p>　　‘Now, I’ll tell you what it is, young man,’ said Mr. Muzzlesolemnly, enraged at the last two allusions, ‘this here lady(pointing to the cook) keeps company with me; and when youpresume, sir, to talk of keeping chandlers’ shops with her, youinjure me in one of the most delicatest points in which one mancan injure another. Do you understand that, sir?’</p> 
<p>　　Here Mr. Muzzle, who had a great notion of his eloquence, inwhich he imitated his master, paused for a reply.</p> 
<p>　　But Mr. Trotter made no reply. So Mr. Muzzle proceeded in asolemn manner―‘It’s very probable, sir, that you won’t be wanted upstairs forseveral minutes, sir, because my master is at this momentparticularly engaged in settling the hash of your master, sir; andtherefore you’ll have leisure, sir, for a little private talk with me,sir. Do you understand that, sir?’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Muzzle again paused for a reply; and again Mr. Trotterdisappointed him.</p> 
<p>　　‘Well, then,’ said Mr. Muzzle, ‘I’m very sorry to have to explainmyself before ladies, but the urgency of the case will be my excuse.</p> 
<p>　　The back kitchen’s empty, sir. If you will step in there, sir, Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Weller will see fair, and we can have mutual satisfaction till thebell rings. Follow me, sir!’</p> 
<p>　　As Mr. Muzzle uttered these words, he took a step or twotowards the door; and, by way of saving time, began to pull off hiscoat as he walked along.</p> 
<p>　　Now, the cook no sooner heard the concluding words of thisdesperate challenge, and saw Mr. Muzzle about to put it intoexecution, than she uttered a loud and piercing shriek; andrushing on Mr. Job Trotter, who rose from his chair on the instant,tore and buffeted his large flat face, with an energy peculiar toexcited females, and twining her hands in his long black hair, toretherefrom about enough to make five or six dozen of the verylargest-sized mourning-rings. Having accomplished this feat withall the ardour which her devoted love for Mr. Muzzle inspired, shestaggered back; and being a lady of very excitable and delicatefeelings, she instantly fell under the dresser, and fainted away.</p> 
<p>　　At this moment, the bell rang.</p> 
<p>　　‘That’s for you, Job Trotter,’ said Sam; and before Mr. Trottercould offer remonstrance or reply―even before he had time tostanch the wounds inflicted by the insensible lady―Sam seizedone arm and Mr. Muzzle the other, and one pulling before, and theother pushing behind, they conveyed him upstairs, and into theparlour.</p> 
<p>　　It was an impressive tableau. Alfred Jingle, Esquire, aliasCaptain Fitz-Marshall, was standing near the door with his hat inhis hand, and a smile on his face, wholly unmoved by his veryunpleasant situation. Confronting him, stood Mr. Pickwick, whohad evidently been inculcating some high moral lesson; for his lefthand was beneath his coat tail, and his right extended in air, aswas his wont when delivering himself of an impressive address. Ata little distance, stood Mr. Tupman with indignant countenance,carefully held back by his two younger friends; at the farther endof the room were Mr. Nupkins, Mrs. Nupkins, and Miss Nupkins,gloomily grand and savagely vexed. ‘What prevents me,’ said Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Nupkins, with magisterial dignity, as Job was brought in―‘whatprevents me from detaining these men as rogues and impostors?</p> 
<p>　　It is a foolish mercy. What prevents me?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Pride, old fellow, pride,’ replied Jingle, quite at his ease.</p> 
<p>　　‘Wouldn’t do―no go―caught a captain, eh?―ha! ha! very good―husband for daughter―biter bit―make it public―not for worlds―look stupid―very!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Wretch,’ said Mr. Nupkins, ‘we scorn your base insinuations.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I always hated him,’ added Henrietta.</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh, of course,’ said Jingle. ‘Tall young man―old lover―SidneyPorkenham―rich―fine fellow―not so rich as captain, though,eh?―turn him away―off with him―anything for captain―nothing like captain anywhere―all the girls―raving mad―eh,Job, eh?’</p> 
<p>　　Here Mr. Jingle laughed very heartily; and Job, rubbing hishands with delight, uttered the first sound he had given vent tosince he entered the house―a low, noiseless chuckle, whichseemed to intimate that he enjoyed his laugh too much, to let anyof it escape in sound. ‘Mr. Nupkins,’ said the elder lady, ‘this is nota fit conversation for the servants to overhear. Let these wretchesbe removed.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Certainly, my dear,’ Said Mr, Nupkins. ‘Muzzle!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Your Worship.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Open the front door.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, your Worship.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Leave the house!’ said Mr. Nupkins, waving his handemphatically.</p> 
<p>　　Jingle smiled, and moved towards the door.</p> 
<p>　　‘Stay!’ said Mr. Pickwick. Jingle stopped.</p> 
<p>　　‘I might,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘have taken a much greaterrevenge for the treatment I have experienced at your hands, andthat of your hypocritical friend there.’</p> 
<p>　　Job Trotter bowed with great politeness, and laid his handupon his heart.</p> 
<p>　　‘I say,’ said Mr. Pickwick, growing gradually angry, ‘that I mighthave taken a greater revenge, but I content myself with exposingyou, which I consider a duty I owe to society. This is a leniency,sir, which I hope you will remember.’</p> 
<p>　　When Mr. Pickwick arrived at this point, Job Trotter, withfacetious gravity, applied his hand to his ear, as if desirous not tolose a syllable he uttered.</p> 
<p>　　‘And I have only to add, sir,’ said Mr. Pickwick, now thoroughlyangry, ‘that I consider you a rascal, and a―a―ruffian―and―andworse than any man I ever saw, or heard of, except that pious andsanctified vagabond in the mulberry livery.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Ha! ha!’ said Jingle, ‘good fellow, Pickwick―fine heart―stoutold boy―but must not be passionate―bad thing, very―bye, bye―see you again some day―keep up your spirits―now, Job―trot!’</p> 
<p>　　With these words, Mr. Jingle stuck on his hat in his old fashion,and strode out of the room. Job Trotter paused, looked round,smiled and then with a bow of mock solemnity to Mr. Pickwick,and a wink to Mr. Weller, the audacious slyness of which baffles alldescription, followed the footsteps of his hopeful master.</p> 
<p>　　‘Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick, as Mr. Weller was following.</p> 
<p>　　‘Sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Stay here.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Weller seemed uncertain.</p> 
<p>　　‘Stay here,’ repeated Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Mayn’t I polish that ’ere Job off, in the front garden?’ said Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Weller. ‘Certainly not,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Mayn’t I kick him out o’ the gate, sir?’ said Mr. Weller.</p> 
<p>　　‘Not on any account,’ replied his master.</p> 
<p>　　For the first time since his engagement, Mr. Weller looked, for amoment, discontented and unhappy. But his countenanceimmediately cleared up; for the wily Mr. Muzzle, by concealinghimself behind the street door, and rushing violently out, at theright instant, contrived with great dexterity to overturn both Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Jingle and his attendant, down the flight of steps, into theAmerican aloe tubs that stood beneath.</p> 
<p>　　‘Having discharged my duty, sir,’ said Mr. Pickwick to Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Nupkins, ‘I will, with my friends, bid you farewell. While we thankyou for such hospitality as we have received, permit me to assureyou, in our joint names, that we should not have accepted it, orhave consented to extricate ourselves in this way, from ourprevious dilEmma, had we not been impelled by a strong sense ofduty. We return to London to-morrow. Your secret is safe with us.’</p> 
<p>　　Having thus entered his protest against their treatment of themorning, Mr. Pickwick bowed low to the ladies, andnotwithstanding the solicitations of the family, left the room withhis friends.</p> 
<p>　　‘Get your hat, Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘It’s below stairs, sir,’ said Sam, and he ran down after it.</p> 
<p>　　Now, there was nobody in the kitchen, but the prettyhousemaid; and as Sam’s hat was mislaid, he had to look for it,and the pretty housemaid lighted him. They had to look all overthe place for the hat. The pretty housemaid, in her anxiety to findit, went down on her knees, and turned over all the things thatwere heaped together in a little corner by the door. It was anawkward corner. You couldn’t get at it without shutting the doorfirst.</p> 
<p>　　‘Here it is,’ said the pretty housemaid. ‘This is it, ain’t it?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Let me look,’ said Sam.</p> 
<p>　　The pretty housemaid had stood the candle on the floor; and, asit gave a very dim light, Sam was obliged to go down on his kneesbefore he could see whether it really was his own hat or not. it wasa remarkably small corner, and so―it was nobody’s fault but theman’s who built the house―Sam and the pretty housemaid werenecessarily very close together.</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, this is it,’ said Sam. ‘Good-bye!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Good-bye!’ said the pretty housemaid.</p> 
<p>　　‘Good-bye!’ said Sam; and as he said it, he dropped the hat thathad cost so much trouble in looking for.</p> 
<p>　　‘How awkward you are,’ said the pretty housemaid. ‘You’ll loseit again, if you don’t take care.’</p> 
<p>　　So just to prevent his losing it again, she put it on for him.</p> 
<p>　　Whether it was that the pretty housemaid’s face looked prettierstill, when it was raised towards Sam’s, or whether it was theaccidental consequence of their being so near to each other, ismatter of uncertainty to this day; but Sam kissed her.</p> 
<p>　　‘You don’t mean to say you did that on purpose,’ said the prettyhousemaid, blushing.</p> 
<p>　　‘No, I didn’t then,’ said Sam; ‘but I will now.’</p> 
<p>　　So he kissed her again. ‘Sam!’ said Mr. Pickwick, calling overthe banisters.</p> 
<p>　　‘Coming, sir,’ replied Sam, running upstairs.</p> 
<p>　　‘How long you have been!’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘There was something behind the door, sir, which perwentedour getting it open, for ever so long, sir,’ replied Sam.</p> 
<p>　　And this was the first passage of Mr. Weller’s first love.</p>
