It was a remarkably fine day;and he had not turned the matter over in his mind ten minutes,when he was suddenly stricken filial and affectionate; and itoccurred to him so strongly that he ought to go down and see hisfather, and pay his duty to his mother-in-law, that he was lost inastonishment at his own remissness in never thinking of thismoral obligation before. Anxious to atone for his past neglectwithout another hour’s delay, he straightway walked upstairs toMr. Pickwick, and requested leave of absence for this laudablepurpose.</p> 
<p>　　‘Certainly, Sam, certainly,’ said Mr. Pickwick, his eyesglistening with delight at this manifestation of filial feeling on thepart of his attendant; ‘certainly, Sam.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Weller made a grateful bow.</p> 
<p>　　‘I am very glad to see that you have so high a sense of yourduties as a son, Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘I always had, sir,’ replied Mr. Weller.</p> 
<p>　　‘That’s a very gratifying reflection, Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwickapprovingly.</p> 
<p>　　‘Wery, sir,’ replied Mr. Weller; ‘if ever I wanted anythin’ o’ myfather, I always asked for it in a wery ’spectful and obligin’</p> 
<p>　　manner. If he didn’t give it me, I took it, for fear I should be led todo anythin’ wrong, through not havin’ it. I saved him a world o’</p> 
<p>　　trouble this vay, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘That’s not precisely what I meant, Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick,shaking his head, with a slight smile.</p> 
<p>　　‘All good feelin’, sir―the wery best intentions, as the gen’l’m’nsaid ven he run away from his wife ’cos she seemed unhappy withhim,’ replied Mr. Weller.</p> 
<p>　　‘You may go, Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Thank’ee, sir,’ replied Mr. Weller; and having made his bestbow, and put on his best clothes, Sam planted himself on the topof the Arundel coach, and journeyed on to Dorking.</p> 
<p>　　The Marquis of Granby, in Mrs. Weller’s time, was quite amodel of a roadside public-house of the better class―just largeenough to be convenient, and small enough to be snug. On theopposite side of the road was a large sign-board on a high post,representing the head and shoulders of a gentleman with anapoplectic countenance, in a red coat with deep blue facings, and atouch of the same blue over his three-cornered hat, for a sky. Overthat again were a pair of flags; beneath the last button of his coatwere a couple of cannon; and the whole formed an expressive andundoubted likeness of the Marquis of Granby of glorious memory.</p> 
<p>　　The bar window displayed a choice collection of geraniumplants, and a well-dusted row of spirit phials. The open shuttersbore a variety of golden inscriptions, eulogistic of good beds andneat wines; and the choice group of countrymen and hostlerslounging about the stable door and horse-trough, affordedpresumptive proof of the excellent quality of the ale and spiritswhich were sold within. Sam Weller paused, when he dismountedfrom the coach, to note all these little indications of a thrivingbusiness, with the eye of an experienced traveller; and havingdone so, stepped in at once, highly satisfied with everything hehad observed.</p> 
<p>　　‘Now, then!’ said a shrill female voice the instant Sam thrust hishead in at the door, ‘what do you want, young man?’</p> 
<p>　　Sam looked round in the direction whence the voice proceeded.</p> 
<p>　　It came from a rather stout lady of comfortable appearance, whowas seated beside the fireplace in the bar, blowing the fire to makethe kettle boil for tea. She was not alone; for on the other side ofthe fireplace, sitting bolt upright in a high-backed chair, was aman in threadbare black clothes, with a back almost as long andstiff as that of the chair itself, who caught Sam’s most particularand especial attention at once.</p> 
<p>　　He was a prim-faced, red-nosed man, with a long, thincountenance, and a semi-rattlesnake sort of eye―rather sharp, butdecidedly bad. He wore very short trousers, and black cottonstockings, which, like the rest of his apparel, were particularlyrusty. His looks were starched, but his white neckerchief was not,and its long limp ends straggled over his closely-buttonedwaistcoat in a very uncouth and unpicturesque fashion. A pair ofold, worn, beaver gloves, a broad-brimmed hat, and a faded greenumbrella, with plenty of whalebone sticking through the bottom,as if to counterbalance the want of a handle at the top, lay on achair beside him; and, being disposed in a very tidy and carefulmanner, seemed to imply that the red-nosed man, whoever hewas, had no intention of going away in a hurry.</p> 
<p>　　To do the red-nosed man justice, he would have been very farfrom wise if he had entertained any such intention; for, to judgefrom all appearances, he must have been possessed of a mostdesirable circle of acquaintance, if he could have reasonablyexpected to be more comfortable anywhere else. The fire wasblazing brightly under the influence of the bellows, and the kettlewas singing gaily under the influence of both. A small tray of tea-things was arranged on the table; a plate of hot buttered toast wasgently simmering before the fire; and the red-nosed man himselfwas busily engaged in converting a large slice of bread into thesame agreeable edible, through the instrumentality of a long brasstoasting-fork. Beside him stood a glass of reeking hot pine-applerum-and-water, with a slice of lemon in it; and every time the red-nosed man stopped to bring the round of toast to his eye, with theview of ascertaining how it got on, he imbibed a drop or two of thehot pine-apple rum-and-water, and smiled upon the rather stoutlady, as she blew the fire.</p> 
<p>　　Sam was so lost in the contemplation of this comfortable scene,that he suffered the first inquiry of the rather stout lady to passunheeded. It was not until it had been twice repeated, each time ina shriller tone, that he became conscious of the impropriety of hisbehaviour.</p> 
<p>　　‘Governor in?’ inquired Sam, in reply to the question.</p> 
<p>　　‘No, he isn’t,’ replied Mrs. Weller; for the rather stout lady wasno other than the quondam relict and sole executrix of the dead-and-gone Mr. Clarke; ‘no, he isn’t, and I don’t expect him, either.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I suppose he’s drivin’ up to-day?’ said Sam.</p> 
<p>　　‘He may be, or he may not,’ replied Mrs. Weller, buttering theround of toast which the red-nosed man had just finished. ‘I don’tknow, and, what’s more, I don’t care.―Ask a blessin’, Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Stiggins.’</p> 
<p>　　The red-nosed man did as he was desired, and instantlycommenced on the toast with fierce voracity.</p> 
<p>　　The appearance of the red-nosed man had induced Sam, at firstsight, to more than half suspect that he was the deputy-shepherdof whom his estimable parent had spoken. The moment he sawhim eat, all doubt on the subject was removed, and he perceived atonce that if he purposed to take up his temporary quarters wherehe was, he must make his footing good without delay. He thereforecommenced proceedings by putting his arm over the half-door ofthe bar, coolly unbolting it, and leisurely walking in.</p> 
<p>　　‘Mother-in-law,’ said Sam, ‘how are you?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Why, I do believe he is a Weller!’ said Mrs. W., raising her eyesto Sam’s face, with no very gratified expression of countenance.</p> 
<p>　　‘I rayther think he is,’ said the imperturbable Sam; ‘and I hopethis here reverend gen’l’m’n ‘ll excuse me saying that I wish I wasthe Weller as owns you, mother-in-law.’</p> 
<p>　　This was a double-barrelled compliment. It implied that Mrs.</p> 
<p>　　Weller was a most agreeable female, and also that Mr. Stigginshad a clerical appearance. It made a visible impression at once;and Sam followed up his advantage by kissing his mother-in-law.</p> 
<p>　　‘Get along with you!’ said Mrs. Weller, pushing him away. ‘Forshame, young man!’ said the gentleman with the red nose.</p> 
<p>　　‘No offence, sir, no offence,’ replied Sam; ‘you’re wery right,though; it ain’t the right sort o’ thing, ven mothers-in-law is youngand good-looking, is it, sir?’</p> 
<p>　　‘It’s all vanity,’ said Mr. Stiggins.</p> 
<p>　　‘Ah, so it is,’ said Mrs. Weller, setting her cap to rights.</p> 
<p>　　Sam thought it was, too, but he held his peace.</p> 
<p>　　The deputy-shepherd seemed by no means best pleased withSam’s arrival; and when the first effervescence of the complimenthad subsided, even Mrs. Weller looked as if she could have sparedhim without the smallest inconvenience. However, there he was;and as he couldn’t be decently turned out, they all three sat downto tea.</p> 
<p>　　‘And how’s father?’ said Sam.</p> 
<p>　　At this inquiry, Mrs. Weller raised her hands, and turned up hereyes, as if the subject were too painful to be alluded to.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Stiggins groaned.</p> 
<p>　　‘What’s the matter with that ’ere gen’l’m’n?’ inquired Sam.</p> 
<p>　　‘He’s shocked at the way your father goes on in,’ replied Mrs.</p> 
<p>　　Weller.</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh, he is, is he?’ said Sam.</p> 
<p>　　‘And with too good reason,’ added Mrs. Weller gravely.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Stiggins took up a fresh piece of toast, and groaned heavily.</p> 
<p>　　‘He is a dreadful reprobate,’ said Mrs. Weller.</p> 
<p>　　‘A man of wrath!’ exclaimed Mr. Stiggins. He took a large semi-circular bite out of the toast, and groaned again.</p> 
<p>　　Sam felt very strongly disposed to give the reverend Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Stiggins something to groan for, but he repressed his inclination,and merely asked, ‘What’s the old ’un up to now?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Up to, indeed!’ said Mrs. Weller, ‘Oh, he has a hard heart.</p> 
<p>　　Night after night does this excellent man―don’t frown, Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Stiggins; I will say you are an excellent man―come and sit here,for hours together, and it has not the least effect upon him.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Well, that is odd,’ said Sam; ‘it ’ud have a wery considerableeffect upon me, if I wos in his place; I know that.’</p> 
<p>　　‘The fact is, my young friend,’ said Mr. Stiggins solemnly, ‘hehas an obderrate bosom. Oh, my young friend, who else couldhave resisted the pleading of sixteen of our fairest sisters, andwithstood their exhortations to subscribe to our noble society forproviding the infant negroes in the West Indies with flannelwaistcoats and moral pocket-handkerchiefs?’</p> 
<p>　　‘What’s a moral pocket-ankercher?’ said Sam; ‘I never see oneo’ them articles o’ furniter.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Those which combine amusement With instruction, my youngfriend,’ replied Mr. Stiggins, ‘blending select tales with wood-cuts.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh, I know,’ said Sam; ‘them as hangs up in the linen-drapers’</p> 
<p>　　shops, with beggars’ petitions and all that ’ere upon ‘em?’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Stiggins began a third round of toast, and nodded assent.</p> 
<p>　　‘And he wouldn’t be persuaded by the ladies, wouldn’t he?’ saidSam.</p> 
<p>　　‘Sat and smoked his pipe, and said the infant negroes were―what did he say the infant negroes were?’ said Mrs. Weller.</p> 
<p>　　‘Little humbugs,’ replied Mr. Stiggins, deeply affected.</p> 
<p>　　‘Said the infant negroes were little humbugs,’ repeated Mrs.</p> 
<p>　　Weller. And they both groaned at the atrocious conduct of theelder Mr. Weller.</p> 
<p>　　A great many more iniquities of a similar nature might havebeen disclosed, only the toast being all eaten, the tea having gotvery weak, and Sam holding out no indications of meaning to go,Mr. Stiggins suddenly recollected that he had a most pressingappointment with the shepherd, and took himself off accordingly.</p> 
<p>　　The tea-things had been scarcely put away, and the hearthswept up, when the London coach deposited Mr. Weller, senior, atthe door; his legs deposited him in the bar; and his eyes showedhim his son.</p> 
<p>　　‘What, Sammy!’ exclaimed the father.</p> 
<p>　　‘What, old Nobs!’ ejaculated the son. And they shook handsheartily.</p> 
<p>　　‘Wery glad to see you, Sammy,’ said the elder Mr. Weller,‘though how you’ve managed to get over your mother-in-law, is amystery to me. I only vish you’d write me out the receipt, that’sall.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Hush!’ said Sam, ‘she’s at home, old feller.’</p> 
<p>　　‘She ain’t vithin hearin’,’ replied Mr. Weller; ‘she always goesand blows up, downstairs, for a couple of hours arter tea; so we’lljust give ourselves a damp, Sammy.’</p> 
<p>　　Saying this, Mr. Weller mixed two glasses of spirits-and-water,and produced a couple of pipes. The father and son sitting downopposite each other; Sam on one side of the fire, in the high-backed chair, and Mr. Weller, senior, on the other, in an easy ditto,they proceeded to enjoy themselves with all due gravity.</p> 
<p>　　‘Anybody been here, Sammy?’ asked Mr. Weller, senior, dryly,after a long silence.</p> 
<p>　　Sam nodded an expressive assent.</p> 
<p>　　‘Red-nosed chap?’ inquired Mr. Weller.</p> 
<p>　　Sam nodded again.</p> 
<p>　　‘Amiable man that ’ere, Sammy,’ said Mr. Weller, smokingviolently.</p> 
<p>　　‘Seems so,’ observed Sam.</p> 
<p>　　‘Good hand at accounts,’ said Mr. Weller. ‘Is he?’ said Sam.</p> 
<p>　　‘Borrows eighteenpence on Monday, and comes on Tuesday fora shillin’ to make it up half-a-crown; calls again on Vensday foranother half-crown to make it five shillin’s; and goes on, doubling,till he gets it up to a five pund note in no time, like them sums inthe ’rithmetic book ’bout the nails in the horse’s shoes, Sammy.’</p> 
<p>　　Sam intimated by a nod that he recollected the problem alludedto by his parent.</p> 
<p>　　‘So you vouldn’t subscribe to the flannel veskits?’ said Sam,after another interval of smoking.</p> 
<p>　　‘Cert’nly not,’ replied Mr. Weller; ‘what’s the good o’ flannelveskits to the young niggers abroad? But I’ll tell you what it is,Sammy,’ said Mr. Weller, lowering his voice, and bending acrossthe fireplace; ‘I’d come down wery handsome towards straitveskits for some people at home.’</p> 
<p>　　As Mr. Weller said this, he slowly recovered his former position,and winked at his first-born, in a profound manner.</p> 
<p>　　‘It cert’nly seems a queer start to send out pocket-’ankerchersto people as don’t know the use on ’em,’ observed Sam.</p> 
<p>　　‘They’re alvays a-doin’ some gammon of that sort, Sammy,’</p> 
<p>　　replied his father. ‘T’other Sunday I wos walkin’ up the road, wenwho should I see, a-standin’ at a chapel door, with a blue soup-plate in her hand, but your mother-in-law! I werily believe therewas change for a couple o’ suv’rins in it, then, Sammy, all inha’pence; and as the people come out, they rattled the pennies init, till you’d ha’ thought that no mortal plate as ever was baked,could ha’ stood the wear and tear. What d’ye think it was all for?’</p> 
<p>　　‘For another tea-drinkin’, perhaps,’ said Sam.</p> 
<p>　　‘Not a bit on it,’ replied the father; ‘for the shepherd’s water-rate, Sammy.’</p> 
<p>　　‘The shepherd’s water-rate!’ said Sam.</p> 
<p>　　‘Ay,’ replied Mr. Weller, ‘there was three quarters owin’, andthe shepherd hadn’t paid a farden, not he―perhaps it might be onaccount that the water warn’t o’ much use to him, for it’s werylittle o’ that tap he drinks, Sammy, wery; he knows a trick worth agood half-dozen of that, he does. Hows’ever, it warn’t paid, and sothey cuts the water off. Down goes the shepherd to chapel, givesout as he’s a persecuted saint, and says he hopes the heart of theturncock as cut the water off, ‘ll be softened, and turned in theright vay, but he rayther thinks he’s booked for somethin’</p> 
<p>　　uncomfortable. Upon this, the women calls a meetin’, sings ahymn, wotes your mother-in-law into the chair, wolunteers acollection next Sunday, and hands it all over to the shepherd. Andif he ain’t got enough out on ’em, Sammy, to make him free of thewater company for life,’ said Mr. Weller, in conclusion, ‘I’m oneDutchman, and you’re another, and that’s all about it.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Weller smoked for some minutes in silence, and thenresumed―‘The worst o’ these here shepherds is, my boy, that theyreg’larly turns the heads of all the young ladies, about here. Lordbless their little hearts, they thinks it’s all right, and don’t know nobetter; but they’re the wictims o’ gammon, Samivel, they’re thewictims o’ gammon.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I s’pose they are,’ said Sam.</p> 
<p>　　‘Nothin’ else,’ said Mr. Weller, shaking his head gravely; ‘andwot aggrawates me, Samivel, is to see ’em a-wastin’ all their timeand labour in making clothes for copper-coloured people as don’twant ’em, and taking no notice of flesh-coloured Christians as do.</p> 
<p>　　If I’d my vay, Samivel, I’d just stick some o’ these here lazyshepherds behind a heavy wheelbarrow, and run ’em up and downa fourteen-inch-wide plank all day. That ’ud shake the nonsenseout of ’em, if anythin’ vould.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Weller, having delivered this gentle recipe with strongemphasis, eked out by a variety of nods and contortions of the eye,emptied his glass at a draught, and knocked the ashes out of hispipe, with native dignity.</p> 
<p>　　He was engaged in this operation, when a shrill voice was heardin the passage.</p> 
<p>　　‘Here’s your dear relation, Sammy,’ said Mr. Weller; and Mrs.</p> 
<p>　　W. hurried into the room.</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh, you’ve come back, have you!’ said Mrs. Weller.</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, my dear,’ replied Mr. Weller, filling a fresh pipe.</p> 
<p>　　‘Has Mr. Stiggins been back?’ said Mrs. Weller.</p> 
<p>　　‘No, my dear, he hasn’t,’ replied Mr. Weller, lighting the pipe bythe ingenious process of holding to the bowl thereof, between thetongs, a red-hot coal from the adjacent fire; and what’s more, mydear, I shall manage to surwive it, if he don’t come back at all.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Ugh, you wretch!’ said Mrs. Weller.</p> 
<p>　　‘Thank’ee, my love,’ said Mr. Weller. ‘Come, come, father,’ saidSam, ‘none o’ these little lovin’s afore strangers. Here’s thereverend gen’l’m’n a-comin’ in now.’ At this announcement, Mrs.</p> 
<p>　　Weller hastily wiped off the tears which she had just begun toforce on; and Mr. W. drew his chair sullenly into the chimney-corner.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Stiggins was easily prevailed on to take another glass of thehot pine-apple rum-and-water, and a second, and a third, and thento refresh himself with a slight supper, previous to beginningagain. He sat on the same side as Mr. Weller, senior; and everytime he could contrive to do so, unseen by his wife, that gentlemanindicated to his son the hidden emotions of his bosom, by shakinghis fist over the deputy-shepherd’s head; a process which affordedhis son the most unmingled delight and satisfaction, the moreespecially as Mr. Stiggins went on, quietly drinking the hot pine-apple rum-and-water, wholly unconscious of what was goingforward.</p> 
<p>　　The major part of the conversation was confined to Mrs. Wellerand the reverend Mr. Stiggins; and the topics principallydescanted on, were the virtues of the shepherd, the worthiness ofhis flock, and the high crimes and misdemeanours of everybodybeside―dissertations which the elder Mr. Weller occasionallyinterrupted by half-suppressed references to a gentleman of thename of Walker, and other running commentaries of the samekind.</p> 
<p>　　At length Mr. Stiggins, with several most indubitable symptomsof having quite as much pine-apple rum-and-water about him ashe could comfortably accommodate, took his hat, and his leave;and Sam was, immediately afterwards, shown to bed by his father.</p> 
<p>　　The respectable old gentleman wrung his hand fervently, andseemed disposed to address some observation to his son; but onMrs. Weller advancing towards him, he appeared to relinquishthat intention, and abruptly bade him good-night.</p> 
<p>　　Sam was up betimes next day, and having partaken of a hastybreakfast, prepared to return to London. He had scarcely set footwithout the house, when his father stood before him.</p> 
<p>　　‘Goin’, Sammy?’ inquired Mr. Weller.</p> 
<p>　　‘Off at once,’ replied Sam.</p> 
<p>　　‘I vish you could muffle that ’ere Stiggins, and take him vithyou,’ said Mr. Weller.</p> 
<p>　　‘I am ashamed on you!’ said Sam reproachfully; ‘what do you lethim show his red nose in the Markis o’ Granby at all, for?’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Weller the elder fixed on his son an earnest look, andreplied, ‘’Cause I’m a married man, Samivel, ’cause I’m a marriedman. Ven you’re a married man, Samivel, you’ll understand agood many things as you don’t understand now; but vether it’sworth while goin’ through so much, to learn so little, as thecharity-boy said ven he got to the end of the alphabet, is a mattero’ taste. I rayther think it isn’t.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Well,’ said Sam, ‘good-bye.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Tar, tar, Sammy,’ replied his father.</p> 
<p>　　‘I’ve only got to say this here,’ said Sam, stopping short, ‘that if Iwas the properiator o’ the Markis o’ Granby, and that ’ere Stigginscame and made toast in my bar, I’d―’</p> 
<p>　　‘What?’ interposed Mr. Weller, with great anxiety. ‘What?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Pison his rum-and-water,’ said Sam.</p> 
<p>　　‘No!’ said Mr. Weller, shaking his son eagerly by the hand,‘would you raly, Sammy-would you, though?’</p> 
<p>　　‘I would,’ said Sam. ‘I wouldn’t be too hard upon him at first. I’ddrop him in the water-butt, and put the lid on; and if I found hewas insensible to kindness, I’d try the other persvasion.’</p> 
<p>　　The elder Mr. Weller bestowed a look of deep, unspeakableadmiration on his son, and, having once more grasped his hand,walked slowly away, revolving in his mind the numerousreflections to which his advice had given rise.</p> 
<p>　　Sam looked after him, until he turned a corner of the road; andthen set forward on his walk to London. He meditated at first, onthe probable consequences of his own advice, and the likelihood ofhis father’s adopting it. He dismissed the subject from his mind,however, with the consolatory reflection that time alone wouldshow; and this is the reflection we would impress upon the reader.</p>
