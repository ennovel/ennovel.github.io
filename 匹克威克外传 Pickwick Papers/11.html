That illustrious man had been separatedfrom his friends and followers for two whole days; and it was witha degree of pleasure and delight, which no common imaginationcan adequately conceive, that he stepped forward to greet Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass, as he encountered those gentlemen onhis return from his early walk. The pleasure was mutual; for whocould ever gaze on Mr. Pickwick’s beaming face withoutexperiencing the sensation? But still a cloud seemed to hang overhis companions which that great man could not but be sensible of,and was wholly at a loss to account for. There was a mysterious airabout them both, as unusual as it was alarming.</p> 
<p>　　‘And how,’ said Mr. Pickwick, when he had grasped hisfollowers by the hand, and exchanged warm salutations ofwelcome―‘how is Tupman?’</p> 
<p>　　A Mr. Winkle, to whom the question was more peculiarlyaddressed, made no reply. He turned away his head, and appearedabsorbed in melancholy reflection.</p> 
<p>　　‘Snodgrass,’ said Mr. Pickwick earnestly, ‘how is our friend―heis not ill?’</p> 
<p>　　‘No,’ replied Mr. Snodgrass; and a tear trembled on hissentimental eyelid, like a rain-drop on a window-frame-’no; he isnot ill.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick stopped, and gazed on each of his friends in turn.</p> 
<p>　　‘Winkle―Snodgrass,’ said Mr. Pickwick; ‘what does this mean?</p> 
<p>　　Where is our friend? What has happened? Speak―I conjure, Ientreat―nay, I command you, speak.’</p> 
<p>　　There was a solemnity―a dignity―in Mr. Pickwick’s manner,not to be withstood.</p> 
<p>　　‘He is gone,’ said Mr. Snodgrass.</p> 
<p>　　‘Gone!’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick. ‘Gone!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Gone,’ repeated Mr. Snodgrass.</p> 
<p>　　‘Where!’ ejaculated Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘We can only guess, from that communication,’ replied Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Snodgrass, taking a letter from his pocket, and placing it in hisfriend’s hand. ‘Yesterday morning, when a letter was receivedfrom Mr. Wardle, stating that you would be home with his sister atnight, the melancholy which had hung over our friend during thewhole of the previous day, was observed to increase. He shortlyafterwards disappeared: he was missing during the whole day, andin the evening this letter was brought by the hostler from theCrown, at Muggleton. It had been left in his charge in themorning, with a strict injunction that it should not be delivereduntil night.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick opened the epistle. It was in his friend’s hand-writing, and these were its contents:―‘My Dear Pickwick,You, my dear friend, are placed far beyond the reach of manymortal frailties and weaknesses which ordinary people cannotovercome. You do not know what it is, at one blow, to be desertedby a lovely and fascinating creature, and to fall a victim to theartifices of a villain, who had the grin of cunning beneath the maskof friendship. I hope you never may.</p> 
<p>　　‘Any letter addressed to me at the Leather Bottle, Cobham,Kent, will be forwarded―supposing I still exist. I hasten from thesight of that world, which has become odious to me. Should Ihasten from it altogether, pity―forgive me. Life, my dearPickwick, has become insupportable to me. The spirit which burnswithin us, is a porter’s knot, on which to rest the heavy load ofworldly cares and troubles; and when that spirit fails us, theburden is too heavy to be borne. We sink beneath it. You may tellRachael―Ah, that name!―‘TRACY TUPMAN.’</p> 
<p>　　‘We must leave this place directly,’ said Mr. Pickwick, as herefolded the note. ‘It would not have been decent for us to remainhere, under any circumstances, after what has happened; and nowwe are bound to follow in search of our friend.’ And so saying, heled the way to the house.</p> 
<p>　　His intention was rapidly communicated. The entreaties toremain were pressing, but Mr. Pickwick was inflexible. Business,he said, required his immediate attendance.</p> 
<p>　　The old clergyman was present.</p> 
<p>　　‘You are not really going?’ said he, taking Mr. Pickwick aside.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick reiterated his former determination.</p> 
<p>　　‘Then here,’ said the old gentleman, ‘is a little manuscript,which I had hoped to have the pleasure of reading to you myself. Ifound it on the death of a friend of mine―a medical man, engagedin our county lunatic asylum―among a variety of papers, which Ihad the option of destroying or preserving, as I thought proper. Ican hardly believe that the manuscript is genuine, though itcertainly is not in my friend’s hand. However, whether it be thegenuine production of a maniac, or founded upon the ravings ofsome unhappy being (which I think more probable), read it, andjudge for yourself.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick received the manuscript, and parted from thebenevolent old gentleman with many expressions of good-will andesteem.</p> 
<p>　　It was a more difficult task to take leave of the inmates ofManor Farm, from whom they had received so much hospitalityand kindness. Mr. Pickwick kissed the young ladies―we weregoing to say, as if they were his own daughters, only, as he mightpossibly have infused a little more warmth into the salutation, thecomparison would not be quite appropriate―hugged the old ladywith filial cordiality; and patted the rosy cheeks of the femaleservants in a most patriarchal manner, as he slipped into thehands of each some more substantial expression of his approval.</p> 
<p>　　The exchange of cordialities with their fine old host and Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Trundle was even more hearty and prolonged; and it was not untilMr. Snodgrass had been several times called for, and at lastemerged from a dark passage followed soon after by Emily (whosebright eyes looked unusually dim), that the three friends wereenabled to tear themselves from their friendly entertainers. Manya backward look they gave at the farm, as they walked slowlyaway; and many a kiss did Mr. Snodgrass waft in the air, inacknowledgment of something very like a lady’s handkerchief,which was waved from one of the upper windows, until a turn ofthe lane hid the old house from their sight.</p> 
<p>　　At Muggleton they procured a conveyance to Rochester. By thetime they reached the last-named place, the violence of their griefhad sufficiently abated to admit of their making a very excellentearly dinner; and having procured the necessary informationrelative to the road, the three friends set forward again in theafternoon to walk to Cobham. A delightful walk it was; for it was a pleasant afternoon in June,and their way lay through a deep and shady wood, cooled by thelight wind which gently rustled the thick foliage, and enlivened bythe songs of the birds that perched upon the boughs. The ivy andthe moss crept in thick clusters over the old trees, and the softgreen turf overspread the ground like a silken mat. They emergedupon an open park, with an ancient hall, displaying the quaint andpicturesque architecture of Elizabeth’s time. Long vistas of statelyoaks and elm trees appeared on every side; large herds of deerwere cropping the fresh grass; and occasionally a startled harescoured along the ground, with the speed of the shadows thrownby the light clouds which swept across a sunny landscape like apassing breath of summer.</p> 
<p>　　‘If this,’ said Mr. Pickwick, looking about him―‘if this were theplace to which all who are troubled with our friend’s complaintcame, I fancy their old attachment to this world would very soonreturn.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I think so too,’ said Mr. Winkle.</p> 
<p>　　‘And really,’ added Mr. Pickwick, after half an hour’s walkinghad brought them to the village, ‘really, for a misanthrope’schoice, this is one of the prettiest and most desirable places ofresidence I ever met with.’</p> 
<p>　　In this opinion also, both Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrassexpressed their concurrence; and having been directed to theLeather Bottle, a clean and commodious village ale-house, thethree travellers entered, and at once inquired for a gentleman ofthe name of Tupman.</p> 
<p>　　‘Show the gentlemen into the parlour, Tom,’ said the landlady.</p> 
<p>　　A stout country lad opened a door at the end of the passage,and the three friends entered a long, low-roofed room, furnishedwith a large number of high-backed leather-cushioned chairs, offantastic shapes, and embellished with a great variety of oldportraits and roughly-coloured prints of some antiquity. At theupper end of the room was a table, with a white cloth upon it, wellcovered with a roast fowl, bacon, ale, and et ceteras; and at thetable sat Mr. Tupman, looking as unlike a man who had taken hisleave of the world, as possible.</p> 
<p>　　On the entrance of his friends, that gentleman laid down hisknife and fork, and with a mournful air advanced to meet them.</p> 
<p>　　‘I did not expect to see you here,’ he said, as he grasped Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick’s hand. ‘It’s very kind.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Ah!’ said Mr. Pickwick, sitting down, and wiping from hisforehead the perspiration which the walk had engendered. ‘Finishyour dinner, and walk out with me. I wish to speak to you alone.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Tupman did as he was desired; and Mr. Pickwick havingrefreshed himself with a copious draught of ale, waited his friend’sleisure. The dinner was quickly despatched, and they walked outtogether.</p> 
<p>　　For half an hour, their forms might have been seen pacing thechurchyard to and fro, while Mr. Pickwick was engaged incombating his companion’s resolution. Any repetition of hisarguments would be useless; for what language could convey tothem that energy and force which their great originator’s mannercommunicated? Whether Mr. Tupman was already tired ofretirement, or whether he was wholly unable to resist the eloquentappeal which was made to him, matters not, he did not resist it atlast.</p> 
<p>　　‘It mattered little to him,’ he said, ‘where he dragged out themiserable remainder of his days; and since his friend laid so muchstress upon his humble companionship, he was willing to share hisadventures.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick smiled; they shook hands, and walked back torejoin their companions.</p> 
<p>　　It was at this moment that Mr. Pickwick made that immortaldiscovery, which has been the pride and boast of his friends, andthe envy of every antiquarian in this or any other country. Theyhad passed the door of their inn, and walked a little way down thevillage, before they recollected the precise spot in which it stood.</p> 
<p>　　As they turned back, Mr. Pickwick’s eye fell upon a small brokenstone, partially buried in the ground, in front of a cottage door. Hepaused.</p> 
<p>　　‘This is very strange,’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘What is strange?’ inquired Mr. Tupman, staring eagerly atevery object near him, but the right one. ‘God bless me, what’s thematter?’</p> 
<p>　　This last was an ejaculation of irrepressible astonishment,occasioned by seeing Mr. Pickwick, in his enthusiasm fordiscovery, fall on his knees before the little stone, and commencewiping the dust off it with his pocket-handkerchief.</p> 
<p>　　‘There is an inscription here,’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Is it possible?’ said Mr. Tupman.</p> 
<p>　　‘I can discern,’ continued Mr. Pickwick, rubbing away with allhis might, and gazing intently through his spectacles―‘I candiscern a cross, and a 13, and then a T. This is important,’</p> 
<p>　　continued Mr. Pickwick, starting up. ‘This is some very oldinscription, existing perhaps long before the ancient alms-housesin this place. It must not be lost.’</p> 
<p>　　He tapped at the cottage door. A labouring man opened it.</p> 
<p>　　‘Do you know how this stone came here, my friend?’ inquiredthe benevolent Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘No, I doan’t, sir,’ replied the man civilly. ‘It was here long aforeI was born, or any on us.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick glanced triumphantly at his companion.</p> 
<p>　　‘You―you―are not particularly attached to it, I dare say,’ saidMr. Pickwick, trembling with anxiety. ‘You wouldn’t mind sellingit, now?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Ah! but who’d buy it?’ inquired the man, with an expression offace which he probably meant to be very cunning.</p> 
<p>　　‘I’ll give you ten shillings for it, at once,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘ifyou would take it up for me.’</p> 
<p>　　The astonishment of the village may be easily imagined, when(the little stone having been raised with one wrench of a spade)Mr. Pickwick, by dint of great personal exertion, bore it with hisown hands to the inn, and after having carefully washed it,deposited it on the table.</p> 
<p>　　The exultation and joy of the Pickwickians knew no bounds,when their patience and assiduity, their washing and scraping,were crowned with success. The stone was uneven and broken,and the letters were straggling and irregular, but the followingfragment of an inscription was clearly to be deciphered:―Mr. Pickwick’s eyes sparkled with delight, as he sat and gloatedover the treasure he had discovered. He had attained one of thegreatest objects of his ambition. In a county known to abound inthe remains of the early ages; in a village in which there stillexisted some memorials of the olden time, he―he, the chairman ofthe Pickwick Club―had discovered a strange and curiousinscription of unquestionable antiquity, which had wholly escapedthe observation of the many learned men who had preceded him.</p> 
<p>　　He could hardly trust the evidence of his senses.</p> 
<p>　　‘This―this,’ said he, ‘determines me. We return to town to-morrow.’</p> 
<p>　　‘To-morrow!’ exclaimed his admiring followers.</p> 
<p>　　‘To-morrow,’ said Mr. Pickwick. ‘This treasure must be at oncedeposited where it can be thoroughly investigated and properlyunderstood. I have another reason for this step. In a few days, anelection is to take place for the borough of Eatanswill, at which Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Perker, a gentleman whom I lately met, is the agent of one of thecandidates. We will behold, and minutely examine, a scene sointeresting to every Englishman.’</p> 
<p>　　‘We will,’ was the animated cry of three voices.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick looked round him. The attachment and fervour ofhis followers lighted up a glow of enthusiasm within him. He wastheir leader, and he felt it.</p> 
<p>　　‘Let us celebrate this happy meeting with a convivial glass,’ saidhe. This proposition, like the other, was received with unanimousapplause. Having himself deposited the important stone in a smalldeal box, purchased from the landlady for the purpose, he placedhimself in an arm-chair, at the head of the table; and the eveningwas devoted to festivity and conversation.</p> 
<p>　　It was past eleven o’clock―a late hour for the little village ofCobham―when Mr. Pickwick retired to the bedroom which hadbeen prepared for his reception. He threw open the latticewindow, and setting his light upon the table, fell into a train ofmeditation on the hurried events of the two preceding days.</p> 
<p>　　The hour and the place were both favourable to contemplation;Mr. Pickwick was roused by the church clock striking twelve. Thefirst stroke of the hour sounded solemnly in his ear, but when thebell ceased the stillness seemed insupportable―he almost felt as ifhe had lost a companion. He was nervous and excited; and hastilyundressing himself and placing his light in the chimney, got intobed.</p> 
<p>　　Every one has experienced that disagreeable state of mind, inwhich a sensation of bodily weariness in vain contends against aninability to sleep. It was Mr. Pickwick’s condition at this moment:</p> 
<p>　　he tossed first on one side and then on the other; andperseveringly closed his eyes as if to coax himself to slumber. Itwas of no use. Whether it was the unwonted exertion he hadundergone, or the heat, or the brandy-and-water, or the strangebed―whatever it was, his thoughts kept reverting veryuncomfortably to the grim pictures downstairs, and the old storiesto which they had given rise in the course of the evening. Afterhalf an hour’s tumbling about, he came to the unsatisfactoryconclusion, that it was of no use trying to sleep; so he got up andpartially dressed himself. Anything, he thought, was better thanlying there fancying all kinds of horrors. He looked out of thewindow―it was very dark. He walked about the room―it was verylonely.</p> 
<p>　　He had taken a few turns from the door to the window, andfrom the window to the door, when the clergyman’s manuscriptfor the first time entered his head. It was a good thought. if it failedto interest him, it might send him to sleep. He took it from his coatpocket, and drawing a small table towards his bedside, trimmedthe light, put on his spectacles, and composed himself to read. Itwas a strange handwriting, and the paper was much soiled andblotted. The title gave him a sudden start, too; and he could notavoid casting a wistful glance round the room. Reflecting on theabsurdity of giving way to such feelings, however, he trimmed thelight again, and read as follows:―‘Yes!―a madman’s! How that word would have struck to myheart, many years ago! How it would have roused the terror thatused to come upon me sometimes, sending the blood hissing andtingling through my veins, till the cold dew of fear stood in largedrops upon my skin, and my knees knocked together with fright! Ilike it now though. It’s a fine name. Show me the monarch whoseangry frown was ever feared like the glare of a madman’s eye―whose cord and axe were ever half so sure as a madman’s gripe.</p> 
<p>　　Ho! ho! It’s a grand thing to be mad! to be peeped at like a wildlion through the iron bars―to gnash one’s teeth and howl, throughthe long still night, to the merry ring of a heavy chain and to rolland twine among the straw, transported with such brave music.</p> 
<p>　　Hurrah for the madhouse! Oh, it’s a rare place!</p> 
<p>　　‘I remember days when I was afraid of being mad; when I usedto start from my sleep, and fall upon my knees, and pray to bespared from the curse of my race; when I rushed from the sight ofmerriment or happiness, to hide myself in some lonely place, andspend the weary hours in watching the progress of the fever thatwas to consume my brain. I knew that madness was mixed up withmy very blood, and the marrow of my bones! that one generationhad passed away without the pestilence appearing among them,and that I was the first in whom it would revive. I knew it must beso: that so it always had been, and so it ever would be: and when Icowered in some obscure corner of a crowded room, and saw menwhisper, and point, and turn their eyes towards me, I knew theywere telling each other of the doomed madman; and I slunk awayagain to mope in solitude.</p> 
<p>　　‘I did this for years; long, long years they were. The nights hereare long sometimes―very long; but they are nothing to therestless nights, and dreadful dreams I had at that time. It makesme cold to remember them. Large dusky forms with sly andjeering faces crouched in the corners of the room, and bent overmy bed at night, tempting me to madness. They told me in lowwhispers, that the floor of the old house in which my father died,was stained with his own blood, shed by his own hand in ragingmadness. I drove my fingers into my ears, but they screamed intomy head till the room rang with it, that in one generation beforehim the madness slumbered, but that his grandfather had lived foryears with his hands fettered to the ground, to prevent his tearinghimself to pieces. I knew they told the truth―I knew it well. I hadfound it out years before, though they had tried to keep it from me.</p> 
<p>　　Ha! ha! I was too cunning for them, madman as they thought me.</p> 
<p>　　‘At last it came upon me, and I wondered how I could ever havefeared it. I could go into the world now, and laugh and shout withthe best among them. I knew I was mad, but they did not evensuspect it. How I used to hug myself with delight, when I thoughtof the fine trick I was playing them after their old pointing andleering, when I was not mad, but only dreading that I might oneday become so! And how I used to laugh for joy, when I was alone,and thought how well I kept my secret, and how quickly my kindfriends would have fallen from me, if they had known the truth. Icould have screamed with ecstasy when I dined alone with somefine roaring fellow, to think how pale he would have turned, andhow fast he would have run, if he had known that the dear friendwho sat close to him, sharpening a bright, glittering knife, was amadman with all the power, and half the will, to plunge it in hisheart. Oh, it was a merry life!</p> 
<p>　　‘Riches became mine, wealth poured in upon me, and I riotedin pleasures enhanced a thousandfold to me by the consciousnessof my well-kept secret. I inherited an estate. The law―the eagle-eyed law itself―had been deceived, and had handed over disputedthousands to a madman’s hands. Where was the wit of the sharp-sighted men of sound mind? Where the dexterity of the lawyers,eager to discover a flaw? The madman’s cunning had overreachedthem all.</p> 
<p>　　‘I had money. How I was courted! I spent it profusely. How Iwas praised! How those three proud, overbearing brothershumbled themselves before me! The old, white-headed father,too―such deference―such respect―such devoted friendship―heworshipped me! The old man had a daughter, and the young mena sister; and all the five were poor. I was rich; and when I marriedthe girl, I saw a smile of triumph play upon the faces of her needyrelatives, as they thought of their well-planned scheme, and theirfine prize. It was for me to smile. To smile! To laugh outright, andtear my hair, and roll upon the ground with shrieks of merriment.</p> 
<p>　　They little thought they had married her to a madman.</p> 
<p>　　‘Stay. If they had known it, would they have saved her? Asister’s happiness against her husband’s gold. The lightest featherI blow into the air, against the gay chain that ornaments my body!</p> 
<p>　　‘In one thing I was deceived with all my cunning. If I had notbeen mad―for though we madmen are sharp-witted enough, weget bewildered sometimes―I should have known that the girlwould rather have been placed, stiff and cold in a dull leadencoffin, than borne an envied bride to my rich, glittering house. Ishould have known that her heart was with the dark-eyed boywhose name I once heard her breathe in her troubled sleep; andthat she had been sacrificed to me, to relieve the poverty of theold, white-headed man and the haughty brothers.</p> 
<p>　　‘I don’t remember forms or faces now, but I know the girl wasbeautiful. I know she was; for in the bright moonlight nights, whenI start up from my sleep, and all is quiet about me, I see, standingstill and motionless in one corner of this cell, a slight and wastedfigure with long black hair, which, streaming down her back, stirswith no earthly wind, and eyes that fix their gaze on me, and neverwink or close. Hush! the blood chills at my heart as I write itdown―that form is hers; the face is very pale, and the eyes areglassy bright; but I know them well. That figure never moves; itnever frowns and mouths as others do, that fill this placesometimes; but it is much more dreadful to me, even than thespirits that tempted me many years ago―it comes fresh from thegrave; and is so very death-like.</p> 
<p>　　‘For nearly a year I saw that face grow paler; for nearly a year Isaw the tears steal down the mournful cheeks, and never knew thecause. I found it out at last though. They could not keep it from melong. She had never liked me; I had never thought she did: shedespised my wealth, and hated the splendour in which she lived;but I had not expected that. She loved another. This I had neverthought of. Strange feelings came over me, and thoughts, forcedupon me by some secret power, whirled round and round mybrain. I did not hate her, though I hated the boy she still wept for. Ipitied―yes, I pitied―the wretched life to which her cold andselfish relations had doomed her. I knew that she could not livelong; but the thought that before her death she might give birth tosome ill-fated being, destined to hand down madness to itsoffspring, determined me. I resolved to kill her.</p> 
<p>　　‘For many weeks I thought of poison, and then of drowning,and then of fire. A fine sight, the grand house in flames, and themadman’s wife smouldering away to cinders. Think of the jest of alarge reward, too, and of some sane man swinging in the wind fora deed he never did, and all through a madman’s cunning! Ithought often of this, but I gave it up at last. Oh! the pleasure ofstropping the razor day after day, feeling the sharp edge, andthinking of the gash one stroke of its thin, bright edge wouldmake!</p> 
<p>　　‘At last the old spirits who had been with me so often beforewhispered in my ear that the time was come, and thrust the openrazor into my hand. I grasped it firmly, rose softly from the bed,and leaned over my sleeping wife. Her face was buried in herhands. I withdrew them softly, and they fell listlessly on herbosom. She had been weeping; for the traces of the tears were stillwet upon her cheek. Her face was calm and placid; and even as Ilooked upon it, a tranquil smile lighted up her pale features. I laidmy hand softly on her shoulder. She started―it was only a passingdream. I leaned forward again. She screamed, and woke.</p> 
<p>　　‘One motion of my hand, and she would never again haveuttered cry or sound. But I was startled, and drew back. Her eyeswere fixed on mine. I knew not how it was, but they cowed andfrightened me; and I quailed beneath them. She rose from the bed,still gazing fixedly and steadily on me. I trembled; the razor was inmy hand, but I could not move. She made towards the door. Asshe neared it, she turned, and withdrew her eyes from my face.</p> 
<p>　　The spell was broken. I bounded forward, and clutched her by thearm. Uttering shriek upon shriek, she sank upon the ground.</p> 
<p>　　‘Now I could have killed her without a struggle; but the housewas alarmed. I heard the tread of footsteps on the stairs. I replacedthe razor in its usual drawer, unfastened the door, and calledloudly for assistance.</p> 
<p>　　‘They came, and raised her, and placed her on the bed. She laybereft of animation for hours; and when life, look, and speechreturned, her senses had deserted her, and she raved wildly andfuriously.</p> 
<p>　　‘Doctors were called in―great men who rolled up to my door ineasy carriages, with fine horses and gaudy servants. They were ather bedside for weeks. They had a great meeting and consultedtogether in low and solemn voices in another room. One, thecleverest and most celebrated among them, took me aside, andbidding me prepare for the worst, told me―me, the madman!―that my wife was mad. He stood close beside me at an openwindow, his eyes looking in my face, and his hand laid upon myarm. With one effort, I could have hurled him into the streetbeneath. It would have been rare sport to have done it; but mysecret was at stake, and I let him go. A few days after, they told meI must place her under some restraint: I must provide a keeper forher. I! I went into the open fields where none could hear me, andlaughed till the air resounded with my shouts!</p> 
<p>　　‘She died next day. The white-headed old man followed her tothe grave, and the proud brothers dropped a tear over theinsensible corpse of her whose sufferings they had regarded in herlifetime with muscles of iron. All this was food for my secret mirth,and I laughed behind the white handkerchief which I held up tomy face, as we rode home, till the tears Came into my eyes.</p> 
<p>　　‘But though I had carried my object and killed her, I wasrestless and disturbed, and I felt that before long my secret mustbe known. I could not hide the wild mirth and joy which boiledwithin me, and made me when I was alone, at home, jump up andbeat my hands together, and dance round and round, and roaraloud. When I went out, and saw the busy crowds hurrying aboutthe streets; or to the theatre, and heard the sound of music, andbeheld the people dancing, I felt such glee, that I could haverushed among them, and torn them to pieces limb from limb, andhowled in transport. But I ground my teeth, and struck my feetupon the floor, and drove my sharp nails into my hands. I kept itdown; and no one knew I was a madman yet.</p> 
<p>　　‘I remember―though it’s one of the last things I can remember:</p> 
<p>　　for now I mix up realities with my dreams, and having so much todo, and being always hurried here, have no time to separate thetwo, from some strange confusion in which they get involved―Iremember how I let it out at last. Ha! ha! I think I see theirfrightened looks now, and feel the ease with which I flung themfrom me, and dashed my clenched fist into their white faces, andthen flew like the wind, and left them screaming and shouting farbehind. The strength of a giant comes upon me when I think of it.</p> 
<p>　　There―see how this iron bar bends beneath my furious wrench. Icould snap it like a twig, only there are long galleries here withmany doors―I don’t think I could find my way along them; andeven if I could, I know there are iron gates below which they keeplocked and barred. hey know what a clever madman I have been,and they are proud to have me here, to show.</p> 
<p>　　‘Let me see: yes, I had been out. It was late at night when Ireached home, and found the proudest of the three proud brotherswaiting to see me―urgent business he said: I recollect it well. Ihated that man with all a madman’s hate. Many and many a timehad my fingers longed to tear him. They told me he was there. Iran swiftly upstairs. He had a word to say to me. I dismissed theservants. It was late, and we were alone together―for the firsttime.</p> 
<p>　　‘I kept my eyes carefully from him at first, for I knew what helittle thought―and I gloried in the knowledge―that the light ofmadness gleamed from them like fire. We sat in silence for a fewminutes. He spoke at last. My recent dissipation, and strangeremarks, made so soon after his sister’s death, were an insult toher memory. Coupling together many circumstances which had atfirst escaped his observation, he thought I had not treated herwell. He wished to know whether he was right in inferring that Imeant to cast a reproach upon her memory, and a disrespect uponher family. It was due to the uniform he wore, to demand thisexplanation.</p> 
<p>　　‘This man had a commission in the army―a commission,purchased with my money, and his sister’s misery! This was theman who had been foremost in the plot to ensnare me, and graspmy wealth. This was the man who had been the main instrumentin forcing his sister to wed me; well knowing that her heart wasgiven to that puling boy. Due to his uniform! The livery of hisdegradation! I turned my eyes upon him―I could not help it―butI spoke not a word.</p> 
<p>　　‘I saw the sudden change that came upon him beneath my gaze.</p> 
<p>　　He was a bold man, but the colour faded from his face, and hedrew back his chair. I dragged mine nearer to him; and Ilaughed―I was very merry then―I saw him shudder. I felt themadness rising within me. He was afraid of me.</p> 
<p>　　‘“You were very fond of your sister when she was alive,” Isaid.―“Very.”</p> 
<p>　　‘He looked uneasily round him, and I saw his hand grasp theback of his chair; but he said nothing.</p> 
<p>　　‘“You villain,” said I, “I found you out: I discovered your hellishplots against me; I know her heart was fixed on some one elsebefore you compelled her to marry me. I know it―I know it.”</p> 
<p>　　‘He jumped suddenly from his chair, brandished it aloft, andbid me stand back―for I took care to be getting closer to him allthe time I spoke.</p> 
<p>　　‘I screamed rather than talked, for I felt tumultuous passionseddying through my veins, and the old spirits whispering andtaunting me to tear his heart out.</p> 
<p>　　‘“Damn you,” said I, starting up, and rushing upon him; “Ikilled her. I am a madman. Down with you. Blood, blood! I willhave it!”</p> 
<p>　　‘I turned aside with one blow the chair he hurled at me in histerror, and closed with him; and with a heavy crash we rolledupon the floor together.</p> 
<p>　　‘It was a fine struggle that; for he was a tall, strong man,fighting for his life; and I, a powerful madman, thirsting to destroyhim. I knew no strength could equal mine, and I was right. Rightagain, though a madman! His struggles grew fainter. I knelt uponhis chest, and clasped his brawny throat firmly with both hands.</p> 
<p>　　His face grew purple; his eyes were starting from his head, andwith protruded tongue, he seemed to mock me. I squeezed thetighter.</p> 
<p>　　‘The door was suddenly burst open with a loud noise, and acrowd of people rushed forward, crying aloud to each other tosecure the madman.</p> 
<p>　　‘My secret was out; and my only struggle now was for libertyand freedom. I gained my feet before a hand was on me, threwmyself among my assailants, and cleared my way with my strongarm, as if I bore a hatchet in my hand, and hewed them downbefore me. I gained the door, dropped over the banisters, and inan instant was in the street.</p> 
<p>　　‘Straight and swift I ran, and no one dared to stop me. I heardthe noise of the feet behind, and redoubled my speed. It grewfainter and fainter in the distance, and at length died awayaltogether; but on I bounded, through marsh and rivulet, overfence and wall, with a wild shout which was taken up by thestrange beings that flocked around me on every side, and swelledthe sound, till it pierced the air. I was borne upon the arms ofdemons who swept along upon the wind, and bore down bank andhedge before them, and spun me round and round with a rustleand a spe ed that made my head swim, until at last they threw mefrom them with a violent shock, and I fell heavily upon the earth.</p> 
<p>　　When I woke I found myself here―here in this gray cell, where thesunlight seldom comes, and the moon steals in, in rays which onlyserve to show the dark shadows about me, and that silent figure inits old corner. When I lie awake, I can sometimes hear strangeshrieks and cries from distant parts of this large place. What theyare, I know not; but they neither come from that pale form, nordoes it regard them. For from the first shades of dusk till theearliest light of morning, it still stands motionless in the sameplace, listening to the music of my iron chain, and watching mygambols on my straw bed.’</p> 
<p>　　At the end of the manuscript was written, in another hand, thisnote:―[The unhappy man whose ravings are recorded above, was amelancholy instance of the baneful results of energies misdirectedin early life, and excesses prolonged until their consequencescould never be repaired. The thoughtless riot, dissipation, anddebauchery of his younger days produced fever and delirium. Thefirst effects of the latter was the strange delusion, founded upon awell-known medical theory, strongly contended for by some, andas strongly contested by others, that an hereditary madnessexisted in his family. This produced a settled gloom, which in timedeveloped a morbid insanity, and finally terminated in ravingmadness. There is every reason to believe that the events hedetailed, though distorted in the description by his diseasedimagination, really happened. It is only matter of wonder to thosewho were acquainted with the vices of his early career, that hispassions, when no longer controlled by reason, did not lead him tothe commission of still more frightful deeds.]</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick’s candle was just expiring in the socket, as heconcluded the perusal of the old clergyman’s manuscript; andwhen the light went suddenly out, without any previous flicker byway of warning, it communicated a very considerable start to hisexcited frame. Hastily throwing off such articles of clothing as hehad put on when he rose from his uneasy bed, and casting afearful glance around, he once more scrambled hastily betweenthe sheets, and soon fell fast asleep.</p> 
<p>　　The sun was shining brilliantly into his chamber, when heawoke, and the morning was far advanced. The gloom which hadoppressed him on the previous night had disappeared with thedark shadows which shrouded the landscape, and his thoughtsand feelings were as light and gay as the morning itself. After ahearty breakfast, the four gentlemen sallied forth to walk toGravesend, followed by a man bearing the stone in its deal box.</p> 
<p>　　They reached the town about one o’clock (their luggage they haddirected to be forwarded to the city, from Rochester), and beingfortunate enough to secure places on the outside of a coach,arrived in London in sound health and spirits, on that sameafternoon.</p> 
<p>　　The next three or four days were occupied with thepreparations which were necessary for their journey to theborough of Eatanswill. As any references to that most importantundertaking demands a separate chapter, we may devote the fewlines which remain at the close of this, to narrate, with greatbrevity, the history of the antiquarian discovery.</p> 
<p>　　It appears from the Transactions of the Club, then, that Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick lectured upon the discovery at a General Club Meeting,convened on the night succeeding their return, and entered into avariety of ingenious and erudite speculations on the meaning ofthe inscription. It also appears that a skilful artist executed afaithful delineation of the curiosity, which was engraven on stone,and presented to the Royal Antiquarian Society, and other learnedbodies: that heart-burnings and jealousies without number werecreated by rival controversies which were penned upon thesubject; and that Mr. Pickwick himself wrote a pamphlet,containing ninety-six pages of very small print, and twenty-sevendifferent readings of the inscription: that three old gentlemen cutoff their eldest sons with a shilling a-piece for presuming to doubtthe antiquity of the fragment; and that one enthusiastic individualcut himself off prematurely, in despair at being unable to fathomits meaning: that Mr. Pickwick was elected an honorary memberof seventeen native and foreign societies, for making thediscovery: that none of the seventeen could make anything of it;but that all the seventeen agreed it was very extraordinary.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Blotton, indeed―and the name will be doomed to theundying contempt of those who cultivate the mysterious and thesublime―Mr. Blotton, we say, with the doubt and cavillingpeculiar to vulgar minds, presumed to state a view of the case, asdegrading as ridiculous. Mr. Blotton, with a mean desire to tarnishthe lustre of the immortal name of Pickwick, actually undertook ajourney to Cobham in person, and on his return, sarcasticallyobserved in an oration at the club, that he had seen the man fromwhom the stone was purchased; that the man presumed the stoneto be ancient, but solemnly denied the antiquity of theinscription―inasmuch as he represented it to have been rudelycarved by himself in an idle mood, and to display letters intendedto bear neither more or less than the simple construction of―‘BILL STUMPS, HIS MARK’; and that Mr. Stumps, being little inthe habit of original composition, and more accustomed to beguided by the sound of words than by the strict rules oforthography, had omitted the concluding ‘L’ of his Christianname.</p> 
<p>　　The Pickwick Club (as might have been expected from soenlightened an institution) received this statement with thecontempt it deserved, expelled the presumptuous and ill-conditioned Blotton from the society, and voted Mr. Pickwick apair of gold spectacles, in token of their confidence andapprobation: in return for which, Mr. Pickwick caused a portrait ofhimself to be painted, and hung up in the club room.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Blotton was ejected but not conquered. He also wrote apamphlet, addressed to the seventeen learned societies, native andforeign, containing a repetition of the statement he had alreadymade, and rather more than half intimating his opinion that theseventeen learned societies were so many ‘humbugs.’ Hereupon,the virtuous indignation of the seventeen learned societies beingroused, several fresh pamphlets appeared; the foreign learnedsocieties corresponded with the native learned societies; the nativelearned societies translated the pamphlets of the foreign learnedsocieties into English; the foreign learned societies translated thepamphlets of the native learned societies into all sorts oflanguages; and thus commenced that celebrated scientificdiscussion so well known to all men, as the Pickwick controversy.</p> 
<p>　　But this base attempt to injure Mr. Pickwick recoiled upon thehead of its calumnious author. The seventeen learned societiesunanimously voted the presumptuous Blotton an ignorantmeddler, and forthwith set to work upon more treatises than ever.</p> 
<p>　　And to this day the stone remains, an illegible monument of Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick’s greatness, and a lasting trophy to the littleness of hisenemies.</p>
