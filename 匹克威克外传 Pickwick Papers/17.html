Mr. Pickwick was laid upwith an attack of rheumatism.</p> 
<p>　　But although the bodily powers of the great man were thusimpaired, his mental energies retained their pristine vigour. Hisspirits were elastic; his good-humour was restored. Even thevexation consequent upon his recent adventure had vanishedfrom his mind; and he could join in the hearty laughter, which anyallusion to it excited in Mr. Wardle, without anger and withoutembarrassment. Nay, more. During the two days Mr. Pickwick wasconfined to bed, Sam was his constant attendant. On the first, heendeavoured to amuse his master by anecdote and conversation;on the second, Mr. Pickwick demanded his writing-desk, and penand ink, and was deeply engaged during the whole day. On thethird, being able to sit up in his bedchamber, he despatched hisvalet with a message to Mr. Wardle and Mr. Trundle, intimatingthat if they would take their wine there, that evening, they wouldgreatly oblige him. The invitation was most willingly accepted; andwhen they were seated over their wine, Mr. Pickwick, with sundryblushes, produced the following little tale, as having been ‘edited’</p> 
<p>　　by himself, during his recent indisposition, from his notes of Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Weller’s unsophisticated recital.</p> 
<p>　　THE PARISH CLERKA Tale Of True Love‘Once upon a time, in a very small country town, at a considerabledistance from London, there lived a little man named NathanielPipkin, who was the parish clerk of the little town, and lived in alittle house in the little High Street, within ten minutes’ walk fromthe little church; and who was to be found every day, from nine tillfour, teaching a little learning to the little boys. Nathaniel Pipkinwas a harmless, inoffensive, good-natured being, with a turned-upnose, and rather turned-in legs, a cast in his eye, and a halt in hisgait; and he divided his time between the church and his school,verily believing that there existed not, on the face of the earth, soclever a man as the curate, so imposing an apartment as thevestry-room, or so well-ordered a seminary as his own. Once, andonly once, in his life, Nathaniel Pipkin had seen a bishop―a realbishop, with his arms in lawn sleeves, and his head in a wig. Hehad seen him walk, and heard him talk, at a confirmation, onwhich momentous occasion Nathaniel Pipkin was so overcomewith reverence and awe, when the aforesaid bishop laid his handon his head, that he fainted right clean away, and was borne out ofchurch in the arms of the beadle.</p> 
<p>　　‘This was a great event, a tremendous era, in Nathaniel Pipkin’slife, and it was the only one that had ever occurred to ruffle thesmooth current of his quiet existence, when happening one fineafternoon, in a fit of mental abstraction, to raise his eyes from theslate on which he was devising some tremendous problem incompound addition for an offending urchin to solve, they suddenlyrested on the blooming countenance of Maria Lobbs, the onlydaughter of old Lobbs, the great saddler over the way. Now, theeyes of Mr. Pipkin had rested on the pretty face of Maria Lobbsmany a time and oft before, at church and elsewhere; but the eyesof Maria Lobbs had never looked so bright, the cheeks of MariaLobbs had never looked so ruddy, as upon this particularoccasion. No wonder then, that Nathaniel Pipkin was unable totake his eyes from the countenance of Miss Lobbs; no wonder thatMiss Lobbs, finding herself stared at by a young man, withdrewher head from the window out of which she had been peeping, andshut the casement and pulled down the blind; no wonder thatNathaniel Pipkin, immediately thereafter, fell upon the youngurchin who had previously offended, and cuffed and knocked himabout to his heart’s content. All this was very natural, and there’snothing at all to wonder at about it.</p> 
<p>　　‘It is matter of wonder, though, that anyone of Mr. NathanielPipkin’s retiring disposition, nervous temperament, and mostparticularly diminutive income, should from this day forth, havedared to aspire to the hand and heart of the only daughter of thefiery old Lobbs―of old Lobbs, the great saddler, who could havebought up the whole village at one stroke of his pen, and never feltthe outlay―old Lobbs, who was well known to have heaps ofmoney, invested in the bank at the nearest market town―who wasreported to have countless and inexhaustible treasures hoardedup in the little iron safe with the big keyhole, over the chimney-piece in the back parlour―and who, it was well known, on festiveoccasions garnished his board with a real silver teapot, cream-ewer, and sugar-basin, which he was wont, in the pride of hisheart, to boast should be his daughter’s property when she found aman to her mind. I repeat it, to be matter of profoundastonishment and intense wonder, that Nathaniel Pipkin shouldhave had the temerity to cast his eyes in this direction. But love isblind; and Nathaniel had a cast in his eye; and perhaps these twocircumstances, taken together, prevented his seeing the matter inits proper light.</p> 
<p>　　‘Now, if old Lobbs had entertained the most remote or distantidea of the state of the affections of Nathaniel Pipkin, he wouldjust have razed the school-room to the ground, or exterminated itsmaster from the surface of the earth, or committed some otheroutrage and atrocity of an equally ferocious and violentdescription; for he was a terrible old fellow, was Lobbs, when hispride was injured, or his blood was up. Swear! Such trains of oathswould come rolling and pealing over the way, sometimes, when hewas denouncing the idleness of the bony apprentice with the thinlegs, that Nathaniel Pipkin would shake in his shoes with horror,and the hair of the pupils’ heads would stand on end with fright.</p> 
<p>　　‘Well! Day after day, when school was over, and the pupils gone,did Nathaniel Pipkin sit himself down at the front window, and,while he feigned to be reading a book, throw sidelong glances overthe way in search of the bright eyes of Maria Lobbs; and he hadn’tsat there many days, before the bright eyes appeared at an upperwindow, apparently deeply engaged in reading too. This wasdelightful, and gladdening to the heart of Nathaniel Pipkin. It wassomething to sit there for hours together, and look upon thatpretty face when the eyes were cast down; but when Maria Lobbsbegan to raise her eyes from her book, and dart their rays in thedirection of Nathaniel Pipkin, his delight and admiration wereperfectly boundless. At last, one day when he knew old Lobbs wasout, Nathaniel Pipkin had the temerity to kiss his hand to MariaLobbs; and Maria Lobbs, instead of shutting the window, andpulling down the blind, kissed hers to him, and smiled. Uponwhich Nathaniel Pipkin determined, that, come what might, hewould develop the state of his feelings, without further delay.</p> 
<p>　　‘A prettier foot, a gayer heart, a more dimpled face, or a smarterform, never bounded so lightly over the earth they graced, as didthose of Maria Lobbs, the old saddler’s daughter. There was aroguish twinkle in her sparkling eyes, that would have made itsway to far less susceptible bosoms than that of Nathaniel Pipkin;and there was such a joyous sound in her merry laugh, that thesternest misanthrope must have smiled to hear it. Even old Lobbshimself, in the very height of his ferocity, couldn’t resist thecoaxing of his pretty daughter; and when she, and her cousinKate―an arch, impudent-looking, bewitching little person―madea dead set upon the old man together, as, to say the truth, theyvery often did, he could have refused them nothing, even had theyasked for a portion of the countless and inexhaustible treasures,which were hidden from the light, in the iron safe.</p> 
<p>　　‘Nathaniel Pipkin’s heart beat high within him, when he sawthis enticing little couple some hundred yards before him onesummer’s evening, in the very field in which he had many a timestrolled about till night-time, and pondered on the beauty of MariaLobbs. But though he had often thought then, how briskly hewould walk up to Maria Lobbs and tell her of his passion if hecould only meet her, he felt, now that she was unexpectedly beforehim, all the blood in his body mounting to his face, manifestly tothe great detriment of his legs, which, deprived of their usualportion, trembled beneath him. When they stopped to gather ahedge flower, or listen to a bird, Nathaniel Pipkin stopped too, andpretended to be absorbed in meditation, as indeed he really was;for he was thinking what on earth he should ever do, when theyturned back, as they inevitably must in time, and meet him face toface. But though he was afraid to make up to them, he couldn’tbear to lose sight of them; so when they walked faster he walkedfaster, when they lingered he lingered, and when they stopped hestopped; and so they might have gone on, until the darknessprevented them, if Kate had not looked slyly back, andencouragingly beckoned Nathaniel to advance. There wassomething in Kate’s manner that was not to be resisted, and soNathaniel Pipkin complied with the invitation; and after a greatdeal of blushing on his part, and immoderate laughter on that ofthe wicked little cousin, Nathaniel Pipkin went down on his kneeson the dewy grass, and declared his resolution to remain there forever, unless he were permitted to rise the accepted lover of MariaLobbs. Upon this, the merry laughter of Miss Lobbs rang throughthe calm evening air―without seeming to disturb it, though; it hadsuch a pleasant sound―and the wicked little cousin laughed moreimmoderately than before, and Nathaniel Pipkin blushed deeperthan ever. At length, Maria Lobbs being more strenuously urgedby the love-worn little man, turned away her head, and whisperedher cousin to say, or at all events Kate did say, that she felt muchhonoured by Mr. Pipkin’s addresses; that her hand and heart wereat her father’s disposal; but that nobody could be insensible to Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pipkin’s merits. As all this was said with much gravity, and asNathaniel Pipkin walked home with Maria Lobbs, and struggledfor a kiss at parting, he went to bed a happy man, and dreamed allnight long, of softening old Lobbs, opening the strong box, andmarrying Maria.</p> 
<p>　　The next day, Nathaniel Pipkin saw old Lobbs go out upon hisold gray pony, and after a great many signs at the window fromthe wicked little cousin, the object and meaning of which he couldby no means understand, the bony apprentice with the thin legscame over to say that his master wasn’t coming home all night,and that the ladies expected Mr. Pipkin to tea, at six o’clockprecisely. How the lessons were got through that day, neitherNathaniel Pipkin nor his pupils knew any more than you do; butthey were got through somehow, and, after the boys had gone,Nathaniel Pipkin took till full six o’clock to dress himself to hissatisfaction. Not that it took long to select the garments he shouldwear, inasmuch as he had no choice about the matter; but theputting of them on to the best advantage, and the touching of themup previously, was a task of no inconsiderable difficulty orimportance.</p> 
<p>　　‘There was a very snug little party, consisting of Maria Lobbsand her cousin Kate, and three or four romping, good-humoured,rosy-cheeked girls. Nathaniel Pipkin had ocular demonstration ofthe fact, that the rumours of old Lobbs’s treasures were notexaggerated. There were the real solid silver teapot, cream-ewer,and sugar-basin, on the table, and real silver spoons to stir the teawith, and real china cups to drink it out of, and plates of the same,to hold the cakes and toast in. The only eye-sore in the whole placewas another cousin of Maria Lobbs’s, and a brother of Kate, whomMaria Lobbs called “Henry,” and who seemed to keep MariaLobbs all to himself, up in one corner of the table. It’s a delightfulthing to see affection in families, but it may be carried rather toofar, and Nathaniel Pipkin could not help thinking that MariaLobbs must be very particularly fond of her relations, if she paidas much attention to all of them as to this individual cousin. Aftertea, too, when the wicked little cousin proposed a game at blindman’s buff, it somehow or other happened that Nathaniel Pipkinwas nearly always blind, and whenever he laid his hand upon themale cousin, he was sure to find that Maria Lobbs was not far off.</p> 
<p>　　And though the wicked little cousin and the other girls pinchedhim, and pulled his hair, and pushed chairs in his way, and allsorts of things, Maria Lobbs never seemed to come near him at all;and once―once―Nathaniel Pipkin could have sworn he heard thesound of a kiss, followed by a faint remonstrance from MariaLobbs, and a half-suppressed laugh from her female friends. Allthis was odd―very odd―and there is no saying what NathanielPipkin might or might not have done, in consequence, if histhoughts had not been suddenly directed into a new channel.</p> 
<p>　　‘The circumstance which directed his thoughts into a newchannel was a loud knocking at the street door, and the personwho made this loud knocking at the street door was no other thanold Lobbs himself, who had unexpectedly returned, and washammering away, like a coffin-maker; for he wanted his supper.</p> 
<p>　　The alarming intelligence was no sooner communicated by thebony apprentice with the thin legs, than the girls tripped upstairsto Maria Lobbs’s bedroom, and the male cousin and NathanielPipkin were thrust into a couple of closets in the sitting-room, forwant of any better places of concealment; and when Maria Lobbsand the wicked little cousin had stowed them away, and put theroom to rights, they opened the street door to old Lobbs, who hadnever left off knocking since he first began.</p> 
<p>　　‘Now it did unfortunately happen that old Lobbs being veryhungry was monstrous cross. Nathaniel Pipkin could hear himgrowling away like an old mastiff with a sore throat; and wheneverthe unfortunate apprentice with the thin legs came into the room,so surely did old Lobbs commence swearing at him in a mostSaracenic and ferocious manner, though apparently with no otherend or object than that of easing his bosom by the discharge of afew superfluous oaths. At length some supper, which had beenwarming up, was placed on the table, and then old Lobbs fell to, inregular style; and having made clear work of it in no time, kissedhis daughter, and demanded his pipe.</p> 
<p>　　‘Nature had placed Nathaniel Pipkin’s knees in very closejuxtaposition, but when he heard old Lobbs demand his pipe, theyknocked together, as if they were going to reduce each other topowder; for, depending from a couple of hooks, in the very closetin which he stood, was a large, brown-stemmed, silver-bowledpipe, which pipe he himself had seen in the mouth of old Lobbs,regularly every afternoon and evening, for the last five years. Thetwo girls went downstairs for the pipe, and upstairs for the pipe,and everywhere but where they knew the pipe was, and old Lobbsstormed away meanwhile, in the most wonderful manner. At lasthe thought of the closet, and walked up to it. It was of no use alittle man like Nathaniel Pipkin pulling the door inwards, when agreat strong fellow like old Lobbs was pulling it outwards. OldLobbs gave it one tug, and open it flew, disclosing NathanielPipkin standing bolt upright inside, and shaking withapprehension from head to foot. Bless us! what an appalling lookold Lobbs gave him, as he dragged him out by the collar, and heldhim at arm’s length.</p> 
<p>　　‘“Why, what the devil do you want here?” said old Lobbs, in afearful voice.</p> 
<p>　　‘Nathaniel Pipkin could make no reply, so old Lobbs shook himbackwards and forwards, for two or three minutes, by way ofarranging his ideas for him.</p> 
<p>　　‘“What do you want here?” roared Lobbs; “I suppose you havecome after my daughter, now!”</p> 
<p>　　‘Old Lobbs merely said this as a sneer: for he did not believethat mortal presumption could have carried Nathaniel Pipkin sofar. What was his indignation, when that poor man replied―‘“Yes,I did, Mr. Lobbs, I did come after your daughter. I love her, Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Lobbs.”</p> 
<p>　　‘“Why, you snivelling, wry-faced, puny villain,” gasped oldLobbs, paralysed by the atrocious confession; “what do you meanby that? Say this to my face! Damme, I’ll throttle you!”</p> 
<p>　　‘It is by no means improbable that old Lobbs would havecarried his threat into execution, in the excess of his rage, if hisarm had not been stayed by a very unexpected apparition: to wit,the male cousin, who, stepping out of his closet, and walking up toold Lobbs, said―‘“I cannot allow this harmless person, sir, who has been askedhere, in some girlish frolic, to take upon himself, in a very noblemanner, the fault (if fault it is) which I am guilty of, and am readyto avow. I love your daughter, sir; and I came here for the purposeof meeting her.”</p> 
<p>　　‘Old Lobbs opened his eyes very wide at this, but not widerthan Nathaniel Pipkin. ‘“You did?” said Lobbs, at last finding breath to speak.</p> 
<p>　　‘“I did.”</p> 
<p>　　‘“And I forbade you this house, long ago.”</p> 
<p>　　‘“You did, or I should not have been here, clandestinely, to-night.”</p> 
<p>　　‘I am sorry to record it of old Lobbs, but I think he would havestruck the cousin, if his pretty daughter, with her bright eyesswimming in tears, had not clung to his arm.</p> 
<p>　　‘“Don’t stop him, Maria,” said the young man; “if he has the willto strike me, let him. I would not hurt a hair of his gray head, forthe riches of the world.”</p> 
<p>　　‘The old man cast down his eyes at this reproof, and they metthose of his daughter. I have hinted once or twice before, that theywere very bright eyes, and, though they were tearful now, theirinfluence was by no means lessened. Old Lobbs turned his headaway, as if to avoid being persuaded by them, when, as fortunewould have it, he encountered the face of the wicked little cousin,who, half afraid for her brother, and half laughing at NathanielPipkin, presented as bewitching an expression of countenance,with a touch of slyness in it, too, as any man, old or young, needlook upon. She drew her arm coaxingly through the old man’s, andwhispered something in his ear; and do what he would, old Lobbscouldn’t help breaking out into a smile, while a tear stole down hischeek at the same time. ‘Five minutes after this, the girls werebrought down from the bedroom with a great deal of giggling andmodesty; and while the young people were making themselvesperfectly happy, old Lobbs got down the pipe, and smoked it; andit was a remarkable circumstance about that particular pipe oftobacco, that it was the most soothing and delightful one he eversmoked.</p> 
<p>　　‘Nathaniel Pipkin thought it best to keep his own counsel, andby so doing gradually rose into high favour with old Lobbs. whotaught him to smoke in time; and they used to sit out in the gardenon the fine evenings, for many years afterwards, smoking anddrinking in great state. He soon recovered the effects of hisattachment, for we find his name in the parish register, as awitness to the marriage of Maria Lobbs to her cousin; and it alsoappears, by reference to other documents, that on the night of thewedding he was incarcerated in the village cage, for having, in astate of extreme intoxication, committed sundry excesses in thestreets, in all of which he was aided and abetted by the bonyapprentice with the thin legs.’</p>
