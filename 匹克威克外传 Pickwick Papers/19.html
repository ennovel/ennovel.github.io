Many a youngpartridge who strutted complacently among the stubble, with allthe finicking coxcombry of youth, and many an older one whowatched his levity out of his little round eye, with thecontemptuous air of a bird of wisdom and experience, alikeunconscious of their approaching doom, basked in the freshmorning air with lively and blithesome feelings, and a few hoursafterwards were laid low upon the earth. But we grow affecting:</p> 
<p>　　let us proceed.</p> 
<p>　　In plain commonplace matter-of-fact, then, it was a finemorning―so fine that you would scarcely have believed that thefew months of an English summer had yet flown by. Hedges,fields, and trees, hill and moorland, presented to the eye theirever-varying shades of deep rich green; scarce a leaf had fallen,scarce a sprinkle of yellow mingled with the hues of summer,warned you that autumn had begun. The sky was cloudless; thesun shone out bright and warm; the songs of birds, the hum ofmyriads of summer insects, filled the air; and the cottage gardens,crowded with flowers of every rich and beautiful tint, sparkled, inthe heavy dew, like beds of glittering jewels. Everything bore thestamp of summer, and none of its beautiful colour had yet fadedfrom the die.</p> 
<p>　　Such was the morning, when an open carriage, in which werethree Pickwickians (Mr. Snodgrass having preferred to remain athome), Mr. Wardle, and Mr. Trundle, with Sam Weller on the boxbeside the driver, pulled up by a gate at the roadside, before whichstood a tall, raw-boned gamekeeper, and a half-booted, leather-legginged boy, each bearing a bag of capacious dimensions, andaccompanied by a brace of pointers.</p> 
<p>　　‘I say,’ whispered Mr. Winkle to Wardle, as the man let downthe steps, ‘they don’t suppose we’re going to kill game enough tofill those bags, do they?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Fill them!’ exclaimed old Wardle. ‘Bless you, yes! You shall fillone, and I the other; and when we’ve done with them, the pocketsof our shooting-jackets will hold as much more.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Winkle dismounted without saying anything in reply to thisobservation; but he thought within himself, that if the partyremained in the open air, till he had filled one of the bags, theystood a considerable chance of catching colds in their heads.</p> 
<p>　　‘Hi, Juno, lass-hi, old girl; down, Daph, down,’ said Wardle,caressing the dogs. ‘Sir Geoffrey still in Scotland, of course,Martin?’</p> 
<p>　　The tall gamekeeper replied in the affirmative, and looked withsome surprise from Mr. Winkle, who was holding his gun as if hewished his coat pocket to save him the trouble of pulling thetrigger, to Mr. Tupman, who was holding his as if he was afraid ofit―as there is no earthly reason to doubt he really was.</p> 
<p>　　‘My friends are not much in the way of this sort of thing yet,Martin,’ said Wardle, noticing the look. ‘Live and learn, you know.</p> 
<p>　　They’ll be good shots one of these days. I beg my friend Winkle’spardon, though; he has had some practice.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Winkle smiled feebly over his blue neckerchief inacknowledgment of the compliment, and got himself somysteriously entangled with his gun, in his modest confusion, thatif the piece had been loaded, he must inevitably have shot himselfdead upon the spot.</p> 
<p>　　‘You mustn’t handle your piece in that ’ere way, when you cometo have the charge in it, sir,’ said the tall gamekeeper gruffly; ‘orI’m damned if you won’t make cold meat of some on us.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Winkle, thus admonished, abruptly altered his position, andin so doing, contrived to bring the barrel into pretty smart contactwith Mr. Weller’s head.</p> 
<p>　　‘Hollo!’ said Sam, picking up his hat, which had been knockedoff, and rubbing his temple. ‘Hollo, sir! if you comes it this vay,you’ll fill one o’ them bags, and something to spare, at one fire.’</p> 
<p>　　Here the leather-legginged boy laughed very heartily, and thentried to look as if it was somebody else, whereat Mr. Winklefrowned majestically.</p> 
<p>　　‘Where did you tell the boy to meet us with the snack, Martin?’</p> 
<p>　　inquired Wardle.</p> 
<p>　　‘Side of One-tree Hill, at twelve o’clock, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘That’s not Sir Geoffrey’s land, is it?’</p> 
<p>　　‘No, sir; but it’s close by it. It’s Captain Boldwig’s land; butthere’ll be nobody to interrupt us, and there’s a fine bit of turfthere.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Very well,’ said old Wardle. ‘Now the sooner we’re off thebetter. Will you join us at twelve, then, Pickwick?’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick was particularly desirous to view the sport, themore especially as he was rather anxious in respect of Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Winkle’s life and limbs. On so inviting a morning, too, it was verytantalising to turn back, and leave his friends to enjoy themselves.</p> 
<p>　　It was, therefore, with a very rueful air that he replied―‘Why, I suppose I must.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Ain’t the gentleman a shot, sir?’ inquired the long gamekeeper.</p> 
<p>　　‘No,’ replied Wardle; ‘and he’s lame besides.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I should very much like to go,’ said Mr. Pickwick―‘very much.’</p> 
<p>　　There was a short pause of commiseration.</p> 
<p>　　‘There’s a barrow t’other side the hedge,’ said the boy. ‘If thegentleman’s servant would wheel along the paths, he could keepnigh us, and we could lift it over the stiles, and that.’</p> 
<p>　　‘The wery thing,’ said Mr. Weller, who was a party interested,inasmuch as he ardently longed to see the sport. ‘The wery thing.</p> 
<p>　　Well said, Smallcheek; I’ll have it out in a minute.’</p> 
<p>　　But here a difficulty arose. The long gamekeeper resolutelyprotested against the introduction into a shooting party, of agentleman in a barrow, as a gross violation of all established rulesand precedents. It was a great objection, but not aninsurmountable one. The gamekeeper having been coaxed andfeed, and having, moreover, eased his mind by ‘punching’ the headof the inventive youth who had first suggested the use of themachine, Mr. Pickwick was placed in it, and off the party set;Wardle and the long gamekeeper leading the way, and Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick in the barrow, propelled by Sam, bringing up the rear.</p> 
<p>　　‘Stop, Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick, when they had got half acrossthe first field.</p> 
<p>　　‘What’s the matter now?’ said Wardle.</p> 
<p>　　‘I won’t suffer this barrow to be moved another step,’ said Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick, resolutely, ’un less Winkle carries that gun of his in adifferent manner.’</p> 
<p>　　‘How am I to carry it?’ said the wretched Winkle. ‘Carry it withthe muzzle to the ground,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘It’s so unsportsmanlike,’ reasoned Winkle.</p> 
<p>　　‘I don’t care whether it’s unsportsmanlike or not,’ replied Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick; ‘I am not going to be shot in a wheel-barrow, for thesake of appearances, to please anybody.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I know the gentleman’ll put that ’ere charge into somebodyafore he’s done,’ growled the long man.</p> 
<p>　　‘Well, well―I don’t mind,’ said poor Winkle, turning his gun-stock uppermost―‘there.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Anythin’ for a quiet life,’ said Mr. Weller; and on they wentagain.</p> 
<p>　　‘Stop!’ said Mr. Pickwick, after they had gone a few yardsfarther.</p> 
<p>　　‘What now?’ said Wardle.</p> 
<p>　　‘That gun of Tupman’s is not safe: I know it isn’t,’ said Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Eh? What! not safe?’ said Mr. Tupman, in a tone of greatalarm.</p> 
<p>　　‘Not as you are carrying it,’ said Mr. Pickwick. ‘I am very sorryto make any further objection, but I cannot consent to go on,unless you carry it as Winkle does his.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I think you had better, sir,’ said the long gamekeeper, ‘oryou’re quite as likely to lodge the charge in yourself as in anythingelse.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Tupman, with the most obliging haste, placed his piece in the position required, and the party moved on again; the twoamateurs marching with reversed arms, like a couple of privates ata royal funeral.</p> 
<p>　　The dogs suddenly came to a dead stop, and the partyadvancing stealthily a single pace, stopped too.</p> 
<p>　　‘What’s the matter with the dogs’ legs?’ whispered Mr. Winkle.</p> 
<p>　　‘How queer they’re standing.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Hush, can’t you?’ replied Wardle softly. ‘Don’t you see, they’remaking a point?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Making a point!’ said Mr. Winkle, staring about him, as if heexpected to discover some particular beauty in the landscape,which the sagacious animals were calling special attention to.</p> 
<p>　　‘Making a point! What are they pointing at?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Keep your eyes open,’ said Wardle, not heeding the question inthe excitement of the moment. ‘Now then.’</p> 
<p>　　There was a sharp whirring noise, that made Mr. Winkle startback as if he had been shot himself. Bang, bang, went a couple ofguns―the smoke swept quickly away over the field, and curledinto the air.</p> 
<p>　　‘Where are they!’ said Mr. Winkle, in a state of the highestexcitement, turning round and round in all directions. ‘Where arethey? Tell me when to fire. Where are they―where are they?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Where are they!’ said Wardle, taking up a brace of birds whichthe dogs had deposited at his feet. ‘Why, here they are.’</p> 
<p>　　‘No, no; I mean the others,’ said the bewildered Winkle.</p> 
<p>　　‘Far enough off, by this time,’ replied Wardle, coolly reloadinghis gun.</p> 
<p>　　‘We shall very likely be up with another covey in five minutes,’</p> 
<p>　　said the long gamekeeper. ‘If the gentleman begins to fire now,perhaps he’ll just get the shot out of the barrel by the time theyrise.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Ha! ha! ha!’ roared Mr. Weller.</p> 
<p>　　‘Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick, compassionating his follower’sconfusion and embarrassment.</p> 
<p>　　‘Sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Don’t laugh.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Certainly not, sir.’ So, by way of indemnification, Mr. Wellercontorted his features from behind the wheel-barrow, for theexclusive amusement of the boy with the leggings, who thereuponburst into a boisterous laugh, and was summarily cuffed by thelong gamekeeper, who wanted a pretext for turning round, to hidehis own merriment.</p> 
<p>　　‘Bravo, old fellow!’ said Wardle to Mr. Tupman; ‘you fired thattime, at all events.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh, yes,’ replied Mr. Tupman, with conscious pride. ‘I let it off.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Well done. You’ll hit something next time, if you look sharp.</p> 
<p>　　Very easy, ain’t it?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, it’s very easy,’ said Mr. Tupman. ‘How it hurts one’sshoulder, though. It nearly knocked me backwards. I had no ideathese small firearms kicked so.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Ah,’ said the old gentleman, smiling, ‘you’ll get used to it intime. Now then―all ready―all right with the barrow there?’</p> 
<p>　　‘All right, sir,’ replied Mr. Weller.</p> 
<p>　　‘Come along, then.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Hold hard, sir,’ said Sam, raising the barrow.</p> 
<p>　　‘Aye, aye,’ replied Mr. Pickwick; and on they went, as briskly asneed be.</p> 
<p>　　‘Keep that barrow back now,’ cried Wardle, when it had beenhoisted over a stile into another field, and Mr. Pickwick had beendeposited in it once more.</p> 
<p>　　‘All right, sir,’ replied Mr. Weller, pausing.</p> 
<p>　　‘Now, Winkle,’ said the old gentleman, ‘follow me softly, anddon’t be too late this time.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Never fear,’ said Mr. Winkle. ‘Are they pointing?’</p> 
<p>　　‘No, no; not now. Quietly now, quietly.’ On they crept, and veryquietly they would have advanced, if Mr. Winkle, in theperformance of some very intricate evolutions with his gun, hadnot accidentally fired, at the most critical moment, over the boy’shead, exactly in the very spot where the tall man’s brain wouldhave been, had he been there instead.</p> 
<p>　　‘Why, what on earth did you do that for?’ said old Wardle, asthe birds flew unharmed away.</p> 
<p>　　‘I never saw such a gun in my life,’ replied poor Mr. Winkle,looking at the lock, as if that would do any good. ‘It goes off of itsown accord. It will do it.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Will do it!’ echoed Wardle, with something of irritation in hismanner. ‘I wish it would kill something of its own accord.’</p> 
<p>　　‘It’ll do that afore long, sir,’ observed the tall man, in a low,prophetic voice.</p> 
<p>　　‘What do you mean by that observation, sir?’ inquired Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Winkle, angrily.</p> 
<p>　　‘Never mind, sir, never mind,’ replied the long gamekeeper;‘I’ve no family myself, sir; and this here boy’s mother will getsomething handsome from Sir Geoffrey, if he’s killed on his land.</p> 
<p>　　Load again, sir, load again.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Take away his gun,’ cried Mr. Pickwick from the barrow,horror-stricken at the long man’s dark insinuations. ‘Take awayhis gun, do you hear, somebody?’</p> 
<p>　　Nobody, however, volunteered to obey the command; and Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Winkle, after darting a rebellious glance at Mr. Pickwick, reloadedhis gun, and proceeded onwards with the rest.</p> 
<p>　　We are bound, on the authority of Mr. Pickwick, to state, thatMr. Tupman’s mode of proceeding evinced far more of prudenceand deliberation, than that adopted by Mr. Winkle. Still, this by nomeans detracts from the great authority of the latter gentleman,on all matters connected with the field; because, as Mr. Pickwickbeautifully observes, it has somehow or other happened, from timeimmemorial, that many of the best and ablest philosophers, whohave been perfect lights of science in matters of theory, have beenwholly unable to reduce them to practice.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Tupman’s process, like many of our most sublimediscoveries, was extremely simple. With the quickness andpenetration of a man of genius, he had at once observed that thetwo great points to be attained were―first, to discharge his piecewithout injury to himself, and, secondly, to do so, without dangerto the bystanders―obviously, the best thing to do, aftersurmounting the difficulty of firing at all, was to shut his eyesfirmly, and fire into the air.</p> 
<p>　　On one occasion, after performing this feat, Mr. Tupman, onopening his eyes, beheld a plump partridge in the act of falling,wounded, to the ground. He was on the point of congratulatingMr. Wardle on his invariable success, when that gentlemanadvanced towards him, and grasped him warmly by the hand.</p> 
<p>　　‘Tupman,’ said the old gentleman, ‘you singled out thatparticular bird?’</p> 
<p>　　‘No,’ said Mr. Tupman―‘no.’</p> 
<p>　　‘You did,’ said Wardle. ‘I saw you do it―I observed you pickhim out―I noticed you, as you raised your piece to take aim; and Iwill say this, that the best shot in existence could not have done itmore beautifully. You are an older hand at this than I thought you,Tupman; you have been out before.’ It was in vain for Mr. Tupmanto protest, with a smile of self-denial, that he never had. The verysmile was taken as evidence to the contrary; and from that timeforth his reputation was established. It is not the only reputationthat has been acquired as easily, nor are such fortunatecircumstances confined to partridge-shooting.</p> 
<p>　　Meanwhile, Mr. Winkle flashed, and blazed, and smoked away,without producing any material results worthy of being noteddown; sometimes expending his charge in mid-air, and at otherssending it skimming along so near the surface of the ground as toplace the lives of the two dogs on a rather uncertain andprecarious tenure. As a display of fancy-shooting, it was extremelyvaried and curious; as an exhibition of firing with any preciseobject, it was, upon the whole, perhaps a failure. It is anestablished axiom, that ‘every bullet has its billet.’ If it apply in anequal degree to shot, those of Mr. Winkle were unfortunatefoundlings, deprived of their natural rights, cast loose upon theworld, and billeted nowhere. ‘Well,’ said Wardle, walking up to theside of the barrow, and wiping the streams of perspiration fromhis jolly red face; ‘smoking day, isn’t it?’</p> 
<p>　　‘It is, indeed,’ replied Mr. Pickwick. The sun is tremendouslyhot, even to me. I don’t know how you must feel it.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Why,’ said the old gentleman, ‘pretty hot. It’s past twelve,though. You see that green hill there?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Certainly.’</p> 
<p>　　‘That’s the place where we are to lunch; and, by Jove, there’sthe boy with the basket, punctual as clockwork!’</p> 
<p>　　‘So he is,’ said Mr. Pickwick, brightening up. ‘Good boy, that.</p> 
<p>　　I’ll give him a shilling, presently. Now, then, Sam, wheel away.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Hold on, sir,’ said Mr. Weller, invigorated with the prospect ofrefreshments. ‘Out of the vay, young leathers. If you walley myprecious life don’t upset me, as the gen’l’m’n said to the driverwhen they was a-carryin’ him to Tyburn.’ And quickening his paceto a sharp run, Mr. Weller wheeled his master nimbly to the greenhill, shot him dexterously out by the very side of the basket, andproceeded to unpack it with the utmost despatch.</p> 
<p>　　‘Weal pie,’ said Mr. Weller, soliloquising, as he arranged theeatables on the grass. ‘Wery good thing is weal pie, when youknow the lady as made it, and is quite sure it ain’t kittens; andarter all though, where’s the odds, when they’re so like weal thatthe wery piemen themselves don’t know the difference?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Don’t they, Sam?’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Not they, sir,’ replied Mr. Weller, touching his hat. ‘I lodged inthe same house vith a pieman once, sir, and a wery nice man hewas―reg’lar clever chap, too―make pies out o’ anything, hecould. “What a number o’ cats you keep, Mr. Brooks,” says I, whenI’d got intimate with him. “Ah,” says he, “I do―a good many,” sayshe, “You must be wery fond o’ cats,” says I. “Other people is,” sayshe, a-winkin’ at me; “they ain’t in season till the winter though,”</p> 
<p>　　says he. “Not in season!” says I. “No,” says he, “fruits is in, cats isout.” “Why, what do you mean?” says I. “Mean!” says he. “That I’llnever be a party to the combination o’ the butchers, to keep up theprice o’ meat,” says he. “Mr. Weller,” says he, a-squeezing myhand wery hard, and vispering in my ear―“don’t mention thishere agin―but it’s the seasonin’ as does it. They’re all made o’</p> 
<p>　　them noble animals,” says he, a-pointin’ to a wery nice little tabby kitten, “and I seasons ’em for beefsteak, weal or kidney, ’cordingto the demand. And more than that,” says he, “I can make a weal abeef-steak, or a beef-steak a kidney, or any one on ’em a mutton, ata minute’s notice, just as the market changes, and appetiteswary!”’</p> 
<p>　　‘He must have been a very ingenious young man, that, Sam,’</p> 
<p>　　said Mr. Pickwick, with a slight shudder.</p> 
<p>　　‘Just was, sir,’ replied Mr. Weller, continuing his occupation ofemptying the basket, ‘and the pies was beautiful. Tongue―, wellthat’s a wery good thing when it ain’t a woman’s. Bread―knuckleo’ ham, reg’lar picter―cold beef in slices, wery good. What’s inthem stone jars, young touch-and-go?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Beer in this one,’ replied the boy, taking from his shoulder acouple of large stone bottles, fastened together by a leathernstrap―‘cold punch in t’other.’</p> 
<p>　　‘And a wery good notion of a lunch it is, take it altogether,’ saidMr. Weller, surveying his arrangement of the repast with greatsatisfaction. ‘Now, gen’l’m’n, “fall on,” as the English said to theFrench when they fixed bagginets.’</p> 
<p>　　It needed no second invitation to induce the party to yield fulljustice to the meal; and as little pressing did it require to induceMr. Weller, the long gamekeeper, and the two boys, to stationthemselves on the grass, at a little distance, and do good executionupon a decent proportion of the viands. An old oak afforded apleasant shelter to the group, and a rich prospect of arable andmeadow land, intersected with luxuriant hedges, and richlyornamented with wood, lay spread out before them.</p> 
<p>　　‘This is delightful―thoroughly delightful!’ said Mr. Pickwick;the skin of whose expressive countenance was rapidly peeling off,with exposure to the sun.</p> 
<p>　　‘So it is―so it is, old fellow,’ replied Wardle. ‘Come; a glass ofpunch!’</p> 
<p>　　‘With great pleasure,’ said Mr. Pickwick; the satisfaction ofwhose countenance, after drinking it, bore testimony to thesincerity of the reply.</p> 
<p>　　‘Good,’ said Mr. Pickwick, smacking his lips. ‘Very good. I’lltake another. Cool; very cool. Come, gentlemen,’ continued Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick, still retaining his hold upon the jar, ‘a toast. Our friendsat Dingley Dell.’</p> 
<p>　　The toast was drunk with loud acclamations.</p> 
<p>　　‘I’ll tell you what I shall do, to get up my shooting again,’ saidMr. Winkle, who was eating bread and ham with a pocket-knife.</p> 
<p>　　‘I’ll put a stuffed partridge on the top of a post, and practise at it,beginning at a short distance, and lengthening it by degrees. Iunderstand it’s capital practice.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I know a gen’l’man, sir,’ said Mr. Weller, ‘as did that, andbegun at two yards; but he never tried it on agin; for he blowed thebird right clean away at the first fire, and nobody ever seed afeather on him arterwards.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Sir,’ replied Mr. Weller.</p> 
<p>　　‘Have the goodness to reserve your anecdotes till they arecalled for.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Cert’nly, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　Here Mr. Weller winked the eye which was not concealed bythe beer-can he was raising to his lips, with such exquisitefacetiousness, that the two boys went into spontaneousconvulsions, and even the long man condescended to smile.</p> 
<p>　　‘Well, that certainly is most capital cold punch,’ said Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick, looking earnestly at the stone bottle; ‘and the day isextremely warm, and―Tupman, my dear friend, a glass of punch?’</p> 
<p>　　‘With the greatest delight,’ replied Mr. Tupman; and havingdrank that glass, Mr. Pickwick took another, just to see whetherthere was any orange peel in the punch, because orange peelalways disagreed with him; and finding that there was not, Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick took another glass to the health of their absent friend,and then felt himself imperatively called upon to propose anotherin honour of the punch-compounder, unknown.</p> 
<p>　　This constant succession of glasses produced considerableeffect upon Mr. Pickwick; his countenance beamed with the mostsunny smiles, laughter played around his lips, and good-humouredmerriment twinkled in his eye. Yielding by degrees to theinfluence of the exciting liquid, rendered more so by the heat, Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick expressed a strong desire to recollect a song which hehad heard in his infancy, and the attempt proving abortive, soughtto stimulate his memory with more glasses of punch, whichappeared to have quite a contrary effect; for, from forgetting thewords of the song, he began to forget how to articulate any wordsat all; and finally, after rising to his legs to address the company inan eloquent speech, he fell into the barrow, and fast asleep,simultaneously.</p> 
<p>　　The basket having been repacked, and it being found perfectlyimpossible to awaken Mr. Pickwick from his torpor, somediscussion took place whether it would be better for Mr. Weller towheel his master back again, or to leave him where he was, untilthey should all be ready to return. The latter course was at lengthdecided on; and as the further expedition was not to exceed anhour’s duration, and as Mr. Weller begged very hard to be one ofthe party, it was determined to leave Mr. Pickwick asleep in thebarrow, and to call for him on their return. So away they went,leaving Mr. Pickwick snoring most comfortably in the shade.</p> 
<p>　　That Mr. Pickwick would have continued to snore in the shadeuntil his friends came back, or, in default thereof, until the shadesof evening had fallen on the landscape, there appears noreasonable cause to doubt; always supposing that he had beensuffered to remain there in peace. But he was not suffered toremain there in peace. And this was what prevented him.</p> 
<p>　　Captain Boldwig was a little fierce man in a stiff blackneckerchief and blue surtout, who, when he did condescend towalk about his property, did it in company with a thick rattan stickwith a brass ferrule, and a gardener and sub-gardener with meekfaces, to whom (the gardeners, not the stick) Captain Boldwig gavehis orders with all due grandeur and ferocity; for CaptainBoldwig’s wife’s sister had married a marquis, and the captain’shouse was a villa, and his land ‘grounds,’ and it was all very high,and mighty, and great.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick had not been asleep half an hour when littleCaptain Boldwig, followed by the two gardeners, came stridingalong as fast as his size and importance would let him; and whenhe came near the oak tree, Captain Boldwig paused and drew along breath, and looked at the prospect as if he thought theprospect ought to be highly gratified at having him to take noticeof it; and then he struck the ground emphatically with his stick,and summoned the head-gardener.</p> 
<p>　　‘Hunt,’ said Captain Boldwig.</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, sir,’ said the gardener.</p> 
<p>　　‘Roll this place to-morrow morning―do you hear, Hunt?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘And take care that you keep this place in good order―do youhear, Hunt?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘And remind me to have a board done about trespassers, andspring guns, and all that sort of thing, to keep the common peopleout. Do you hear, Hunt; do you hear?’</p> 
<p>　　‘I’ll not forget it, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I beg your pardon, sir,’ said the other man, advancing, with hishand to his hat.</p> 
<p>　　‘Well, Wilkins, what’s the matter with you?’ said CaptainBoldwig.</p> 
<p>　　‘I beg your pardon, sir―but I think there have been trespassershere to-day.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Ha!’ said the captain, scowling around him.</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, sir―they have been dining here, I think, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Why, damn their audacity, so they have,’ said Captain Boldwig,as the crumbs and fragments that were strewn upon the grass methis eye. ‘They have actually been devouring their food here. I wishI had the vagabonds here!’ said the captain, clenching the thickstick.</p> 
<p>　　‘I wish I had the vagabonds here,’ said the captain wrathfully.</p> 
<p>　　‘Beg your pardon, sir,’ said Wilkins, ‘but―’</p> 
<p>　　‘But what? Eh?’ roared the captain; and following the timidglance of Wilkins, his eyes encountered the wheel-barrow and Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　 ‘Who are you, you rascal?’ said the captain, administeringseveral pokes to Mr. Pickwick’s body with the thick stick. ‘What’syour name?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Cold punch,’ murmured Mr. Pickwick, as he sank to sleepagain.</p> 
<p>　　‘What?’ demanded Captain Boldwig.</p> 
<p>　　No reply.</p> 
<p>　　‘What did he say his name was?’ asked the captain.</p> 
<p>　　‘Punch, I think, sir,’ replied Wilkins.</p> 
<p>　　‘That’s his impudence―that’s his confounded impudence,’ saidCaptain Boldwig. ‘He’s only feigning to be asleep now,’ said thecaptain, in a high passion. ‘He’s drunk; he’s a drunken plebeian.</p> 
<p>　　Wheel him away, Wilkins, wheel him away directly.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Where shall I wheel him to, sir?’ inquired Wilkins, with greattimidity.</p> 
<p>　　‘Wheel him to the devil,’ replied Captain Boldwig.</p> 
<p>　　‘Very well, sir,’ said Wilkins.</p> 
<p>　　‘Stay,’ said the captain.</p> 
<p>　　Wilkins stopped accordingly.</p> 
<p>　　‘Wheel him,’ said the captain―‘wheel him to the pound; and letus see whether he calls himself Punch when he comes to himself.</p> 
<p>　　He shall not bully me―he shall not bully me. Wheel him away.’</p> 
<p>　　Away Mr. Pickwick was wheeled in compliance with thisimperious mandate; and the great Captain Boldwig, swelling with indignation, proceeded on his walk.</p> 
<p>　　Inexpressible was the astonishment of the little party when theyreturned, to find that Mr. Pickwick had disappeared, and takenthe wheel-barrow with him. It was the most mysterious andunaccountable thing that was ever heard of For a lame man tohave got upon his legs without any previous notice, and walkedoff, would have been most extraordinary; but when it came to hiswheeling a heavy barrow before him, by way of amusement, itgrew positively miraculous. They searched every nook and cornerround, together and separately; they shouted, whistled, laughed,called―and all with the same result. Mr. Pickwick was not to befound. After some hours of fruitless search, they arrived at theunwelcome conclusion that they must go home without him.</p> 
<p>　　Meanwhile Mr. Pickwick had been wheeled to the pound, andsafely deposited therein, fast asleep in the wheel-barrow, to theimmeasurable delight and satisfaction not only of all the boys inthe village, but three-fourths of the whole population, who hadgathered round, in expectation of his waking. If their most intensegratification had been awakened by seeing him wheeled in, howmany hundredfold was their joy increased when, after a fewindistinct cries of ‘Sam!’ he sat up in the barrow, and gazed withindescribable astonishment on the faces before him.</p> 
<p>　　A general shout was of course the signal of his having woke up;and his involuntary inquiry of ‘What’s the matter?’ occasionedanother, louder than the first, if possible.</p> 
<p>　　‘Here’s a game!’ roared the populace.</p> 
<p>　　‘Where am I?’ exclaimed Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘In the pound,’ replied the mob.</p> 
<p>　　‘How came I here? What was I doing? Where was I broughtfrom?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Boldwig! Captain Boldwig!’ was the only reply.</p> 
<p>　　‘Let me out,’ cried Mr. Pickwick. ‘Where’s my servant? Whereare my friends?’</p> 
<p>　　‘You ain’t got no friends. Hurrah!’ Then there came a turnip,then a potato, and then an egg; with a few other little tokens of theplayful disposition of the many-headed.</p> 
<p>　　How long this scene might have lasted, or how much Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick might have suffered, no one can tell, had not a carriage,which was driving swiftly by, suddenly pulled up, from whencethere descended old Wardle and Sam Weller, the former of whom,in far less time than it takes to write it, if not to read it, had madehis way to Mr. Pickwick’s side, and placed him in the vehicle, justas the latter had concluded the third and last round of a singlecombat with the town-beadle.</p> 
<p>　　‘Run to the justice’s!’ cried a dozen voices.</p> 
<p>　　‘Ah, run avay,’ said Mr. Weller, jumping up on the box. ‘Give mycompliments―Mr. Veller’s compliments―to the justice, and tellhim I’ve spiled his beadle, and that, if he’ll swear in a new ’un , I’llcome back again to-morrow and spile him. Drive on, old feller.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I’ll give directions for the commencement of an action for falseimprisonment against this Captain Boldwig, directly I get toLondon,’ said Mr. Pickwick, as soon as the carriage turned out ofthe town.</p> 
<p>　　‘We were trespassing, it seems,’ said Wardle.</p> 
<p>　　‘I don’t care,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘I’ll bring the action.’</p> 
<p>　　‘No, you won’t,’ said Wardle.</p> 
<p>　　‘I will, by―’ But as there was a humorous expression inWardle’s face, Mr. Pickwick checked himself, and said, ‘Why not?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Because,’ said old Wardle, half-bursting with laughter,‘because they might turn on some of us, and say we had taken toomuch cold punch.’</p> 
<p>　　Do what he would, a smile would come into Mr. Pickwick’s face;the smile extended into a laugh; the laugh into a roar; the roarbecame general. So, to keep up their good-humour, they stoppedat the first roadside tavern they came to, and ordered a glass ofbrandy-and-water all round, with a magnum of extra strength forMr. Samuel Weller.</p>
