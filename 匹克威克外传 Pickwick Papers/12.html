Pickwick’s apartments in Goswell Street, although ona limited scale, were not only of a very neat andcomfortable description, but peculiarly adapted for theresidence of a man of his genius and observation. His sitting-roomwas the first-floor front, his bedroom the second-floor front; andthus, whether he were sitting at his desk in his parlour, orstanding before the dressing-glass in his dormitory, he had anequal opportunity of contemplating human nature in all thenumerous phases it exhibits, in that not more populous thanpopular thoroughfare. His landlady, Mrs. Bardell―the relict andsole executrix of a deceased custom-house officer―was a comelywoman of bustling manners and agreeable appearance, with anatural genius for cooking, improved by study and long practice,into an exquisite talent. There were no children, no servants, nofowls. The only other inmates of the house were a large man and asmall boy; the first a lodger, the second a production of Mrs.</p> 
<p>　　Bardell’s. The large man was always home precisely at ten o’clockat night, at which hour he regularly condensed himself into thelimits of a dwarfish French bedstead in the back parlour; and theinfantine sports and gymnastic exercises of Master Bardell wereexclusively confined to the neighbouring pavements and gutters.</p> 
<p>　　Cleanliness and quiet reigned throughout the house; and in it Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick’s will was law.</p> 
<p>　　To any one acquainted with these points of the domesticeconomy of the establishment, and conversant with the admirableregulation of Mr. Pickwick’s mind, his appearance and behaviouron the morning previous to that which had been fixed upon for thejourney to Eatanswill would have been most mysterious andunaccountable. He paced the room to and fro with hurried steps,popped his head out of the window at intervals of about threeminutes each, constantly referred to his watch, and exhibitedmany other manifestations of impatience very unusual with him. Itwas evident that something of great importance was incontemplation, but what that something was, not even Mrs.</p> 
<p>　　Bardell had been enabled to discover.</p> 
<p>　　‘Mrs. Bardell,’ said Mr. Pickwick, at last, as that amiable femaleapproached the termination of a prolonged dusting of theapartment.</p> 
<p>　　‘Sir,’ said Mrs. Bardell.</p> 
<p>　　‘Your little boy is a very long time gone.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Why it’s a good long way to the Borough, sir,’ remonstratedMrs. Bardell.</p> 
<p>　　‘Ah,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘very true; so it is.’ Mr. Pickwickrelapsed into silence, and Mrs. Bardell resumed her dusting.</p> 
<p>　　‘Mrs. Bardell,’ said Mr. Pickwick, at the expiration of a fewminutes.</p> 
<p>　　‘Sir,’ said Mrs. Bardell again. ‘Do you think it a much greaterexpense to keep two people, than to keep one?’</p> 
<p>　　‘La, Mr. Pickwick,’ said Mrs. Bardell, colouring up to the veryborder of her cap, as she fancied she observed a species ofmatrimonial twinkle in the eyes of her lodger; ‘La, Mr. Pickwick,what a question!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Well, but do you?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘That depends,’ said Mrs. Bardell, approaching the duster verynear to Mr. Pickwick’s elbow which was planted on the table. ‘thatdepends a good deal upon the person, you know, Mr. Pickwick;and whether it’s a saving and careful person, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘That’s very true,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘but the person I have inmy eye (here he looked very hard at Mrs. Bardell) I thinkpossesses these qualities; and has, moreover, a considerableknowledge of the world, and a great deal of sharpness, Mrs.</p> 
<p>　　Bardell, which may be of material use to me.’</p> 
<p>　　‘La, Mr. Pickwick,’ said Mrs. Bardell, the crimson rising to hercap-border again.</p> 
<p>　　‘I do,’ said Mr. Pickwick, growing energetic, as was his wont inspeaking of a subject which interested him―‘I do, indeed; and totell you the truth, Mrs. Bardell, I have made up my mind.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Dear me, sir,’ exclaimed Mrs. Bardell.</p> 
<p>　　‘You’ll think it very strange now,’ said the amiable Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick, with a good-humoured glance at his companion, ‘that Inever consulted you about this matter, and never even mentionedit, till I sent your little boy out this morning―eh?’</p> 
<p>　　Mrs. Bardell could only reply by a look. She had longworshipped Mr. Pickwick at a distance, but here she was, all atonce, raised to a pinnacle to which her wildest and mostextravagant hopes had never dared to aspire. Mr. Pickwick wasgoing to propose―a deliberate plan, too―sent her little boy to theBorough, to get him out of the way―how thoughtful―howconsiderate!</p> 
<p>　　‘Well,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘what do you think?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh, Mr. Pickwick,’ said Mrs. Bardell, trembling with agitation,‘you’re very kind, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘It’ll save you a good deal of trouble, won’t it?’ said Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick. ‘Oh, I never thought anything of the trouble, sir,’ repliedMrs. Bardell; ‘and, of course, I should take more trouble to pleaseyou then, than ever; but it is so kind of you, Mr. Pickwick, to haveso much consideration for my loneliness.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Ah, to be sure,’ said Mr. Pickwick; ‘I never thought of that.</p> 
<p>　　When I am in town, you’ll always have somebody to sit with you.</p> 
<p>　　To be sure, so you will.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I am sure I ought to be a very happy woman,’ said Mrs. Bardell.</p> 
<p>　　‘And your little boy―’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Bless his heart!’ interposed Mrs. Bardell, with a maternal sob.</p> 
<p>　　‘He, too, will have a companion,’ resumed Mr. Pickwick, ‘alively one, who’ll teach him, I’ll be bound, more tricks in a weekthan he would ever learn in a year.’ And Mr. Pickwick smiledplacidly.</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh, you dear―’ said Mrs. Bardell.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick started.</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh, you kind, good, playful dear,’ said Mrs. Bardell; andwithout more ado, she rose from her chair, and flung her armsround Mr. Pickwick’s neck, with a cataract of tears and a chorus ofsobs.</p> 
<p>　　‘Bless my soul,’ cried the astonished Mr. Pickwick; ‘Mrs.</p> 
<p>　　Bardell, my good woman―dear me, what a situation―prayconsider.―Mrs. Bardell, don’t―if anybody should come―’</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh, let them come,’ exclaimed Mrs. Bardell frantically; ‘I’llnever leave you―dear, kind, good soul;’ and, with these words,Mrs. Bardell clung the tighter.</p> 
<p>　　‘Mercy upon me,’ said Mr. Pickwick, struggling violently, ‘I hearsomebody coming up the stairs. Don’t, don’t, there’s a goodcreature, don’t.’ But entreaty and remonstrance were alikeunavailing; for Mrs. Bardell had fainted in Mr. Pickwick’s arms;and before he could gain time to deposit her on a chair, MasterBardell entered the room, ushering in Mr. Tupman, Mr. Winkle,and Mr. Snodgrass.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick was struck motionless and speechless. He stoodwith his lovely burden in his arms, gazing vacantly on thecountenances of his friends, without the slightest attempt atrecognition or explanation. They, in their turn, stared at him; andMaster Bardell, in his turn, stared at everybody.</p> 
<p>　　The astonishment of the Pickwickians was so absorbing, andthe perplexity of Mr. Pickwick was so extreme, that they mighthave remained in exactly the same relative situations until thesuspended animation of the lady was restored, had it not been fora most beautiful and touching expression of filial affection on thepart of her youthful son. Clad in a tight suit of corduroy, spangledwith brass buttons of a very considerable size, he at first stood atthe door astounded and uncertain; but by degrees, the impressionthat his mother must have suffered some personal damagepervaded his partially developed mind, and considering Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick as the aggressor, he set up an appalling and semi-earthlykind of howling, and butting forward with his head, commencedassailing that immortal gentleman about the back and legs, withsuch blows and pinches as the strength of his arm, and theviolence of his excitement, allowed.</p> 
<p>　　‘Take this little villain away,’ said the agonised Mr. Pickwick,‘he’s mad.’</p> 
<p>　　‘What is the matter?’ said the three tongue-tied Pickwickians.</p> 
<p>　　‘I don’t know,’ replied Mr. Pickwick pettishly. ‘Take away theboy.’ (Here Mr. Winkle carried the interesting boy, screaming andstruggling, to the farther end of the apartment.) ‘Now help me,lead this woman downstairs.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh, I am better now,’ said Mrs. Bardell faintly.</p> 
<p>　　‘Let me lead you downstairs,’ said the ever-gallant Mr. Tupman.</p> 
<p>　　‘Thank you, sir―thank you;’ exclaimed Mrs. Bardellhysterically. And downstairs she was led accordingly,accompanied by her affectionate son.</p> 
<p>　　‘I cannot conceive,’ said Mr. Pickwick when his friendreturned―‘I cannot conceive what has been the matter with thatwoman. I had merely announced to her my intention of keeping aman-servant, when she fell into the extraordinary paroxysm inwhich you found her. Very extraordinary thing.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Very,’ said his three friends.</p> 
<p>　　‘Placed me in such an extremely awkward situation,’ continuedMr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Very,’ was the reply of his followers, as they coughed slightly,and looked dubiously at each other.</p> 
<p>　　This behaviour was not lost upon Mr. Pickwick. He remarkedtheir incredulity. They evidently suspected him.</p> 
<p>　　‘There is a man in the passage now,’ said Mr. Tupman.</p> 
<p>　　‘It’s the man I spoke to you about,’ said Mr. Pickwick; ‘I sent forhim to the Borough this morning. Have the goodness to call himup, Snodgrass.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Snodgrass did as he was desired; and Mr. Samuel Wellerforthwith presented himself.</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh―you remember me, I suppose?’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘I should think so,’ replied Sam, with a patronising wink. ‘Queerstart that ’ere, but he was one too many for you, warn’t he? Up tosnuff and a pinch or two over―eh?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Never mind that matter now,’ said Mr. Pickwick hastily; ‘I wantto speak to you about something else. Sit down.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Thank’ee, sir,’ said Sam. And down he sat without furtherbidding, having previously deposited his old white hat on thelanding outside the door. ‘‘Tain’t a wery good ’un to look at,’ saidSam, ‘but it’s an astonishin’ ’un to wear; and afore the brim went,it was a wery handsome tile. Hows’ever it’s lighter without it,that’s one thing, and every hole lets in some air, that’s another―wentilation gossamer I calls it.’ On the delivery of this sentiment,Mr. Weller smiled agreeably upon the assembled Pickwickians.</p> 
<p>　　‘Now with regard to the matter on which I, with theconcurrence of these gentlemen, sent for you,’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘That’s the pint, sir,’ interposed Sam; ‘out vith it, as the fathersaid to his child, when he swallowed a farden.’</p> 
<p>　　‘We want to know, in the first place,’ said Mr. Pickwick,‘whether you have any reason to be discontented with yourpresent situation.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Afore I answers that ’ere question, gen’l’m’n,’ replied Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Weller, ‘I should like to know, in the first place, whether you’re a-goin’ to purwide me with a better?’</p> 
<p>　　A sunbeam of placid benevolence played on Mr. Pickwick’sfeatures as he said, ‘I have half made up my mind to engage youmyself.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Have you, though?’ said Sam.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick nodded in the affirmative. ‘Wages?’ inquired Sam.</p> 
<p>　　‘Twelve pounds a year,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Clothes?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Two suits.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Work?’</p> 
<p>　　‘To attend upon me; and travel about with me and thesegentlemen here.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Take the bill down,’ said Sam emphatically. ‘I’m let to a singlegentleman, and the terms is agreed upon.’</p> 
<p>　　‘You accept the situation?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick. ‘Cert’nly,’</p> 
<p>　　replied Sam. ‘If the clothes fits me half as well as the place, they’lldo.’</p> 
<p>　　‘You can get a character of course?’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Ask the landlady o’ the White Hart about that, sir,’ repliedSam.</p> 
<p>　　‘Can you come this evening?’</p> 
<p>　　‘I’ll get into the clothes this minute, if they’re here,’ said Sam,with great alacrity.</p> 
<p>　　‘Call at eight this evening,’ said Mr. Pickwick; ‘and if theinquiries are satisfactory, they shall be provided.’</p> 
<p>　　With the single exception of one amiable indiscretion, in whichan assistant housemaid had equally participated, the history of Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Weller’s conduct was so very blameless, that Mr. Pickwick feltfully justified in closing the engagement that very evening. Withthe promptness and energy which characterised not only thepublic proceedings, but all the private actions of this extraordinaryman, he at once led his new attendant to one of those convenientemporiums where gentlemen’s new and second-hand clothes areprovided, and the troublesome and inconvenient formality ofmeasurement dispensed with; and before night had closed in, Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Weller was furnished with a grey coat with the P. C. button, ablack hat with a cockade to it, a pink striped waistcoat, lightbreeches and gaiters, and a variety of other necessaries, toonumerous to recapitulate.</p> 
<p>　　‘Well,’ said that suddenly-transformed individual, as he took hisseat on the outside of the Eatanswill coach next morning; ‘Iwonder whether I’m meant to be a footman, or a groom, or agamekeeper, or a seedsman. I looks like a sort of compo of everyone on ’em. Never mind; there’s a change of air, plenty to see, andlittle to do; and all this suits my complaint uncommon; so long lifeto the Pickvicks, says I!’</p>
