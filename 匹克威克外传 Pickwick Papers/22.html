<p>　　Weller of his affectionate son, as he entered the yard ofthe Bull Inn, Whitechapel, with a travelling-bag and asmall portmanteau.</p> 
<p>　　‘You might ha’ made a worser guess than that, old feller,’</p> 
<p>　　replied Mr. Weller the younger, setting down his burden in theyard, and sitting himself down upon it afterwards. ‘The governorhisself’ll be down here presently.’</p> 
<p>　　‘He’s a-cabbin’ it, I suppose?’ said the father.</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, he’s a havin’ two mile o’ danger at eight-pence,’ respondedthe son. ‘How’s mother-in-law this mornin’?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Queer, Sammy, queer,’ replied the elder Mr. Weller, withimpressive gravity. ‘She’s been gettin’ rayther in the Methodisticalorder lately, Sammy; and she is uncommon pious, to be sure.</p> 
<p>　　She’s too good a creetur for me, Sammy. I feel I don’t deserve her.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Ah,’ said Mr. Samuel. ‘that’s wery self-denyin’ o’ you.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Wery,’ replied his parent, with a sigh. ‘She’s got hold o’ someinwention for grown-up people being born again, Sammy―thenew birth, I think they calls it. I should wery much like to see thatsystem in haction, Sammy. I should wery much like to see yourmother-in-law born again. Wouldn’t I put her out to nurse!’</p> 
<p>　　‘What do you think them women does t’other day,’ continuedMr. Weller, after a short pause, during which he had significantlystruck the side of his nose with his forefinger some half-dozentimes. ‘What do you think they does, t’other day, Sammy?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Don’t know,’ replied Sam, ‘what?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Goes and gets up a grand tea drinkin’ for a feller they callstheir shepherd,’ said Mr. Weller. ‘I was a-standing starin’ in at thepictur shop down at our place, when I sees a little bill about it;“tickets half-a-crown. All applications to be made to thecommittee. Secretary, Mrs. Weller”; and when I got home therewas the committee a-sittin’ in our back parlour. Fourteen women;I wish you could ha’ heard ’em, Sammy. There they was, a-passin’</p> 
<p>　　resolutions, and wotin’ supplies, and all sorts o’ games. Well, whatwith your mother-in-law a-worrying me to go, and what with mylooking for’ard to seein’ some queer starts if I did, I put my namedown for a ticket; at six o’clock on the Friday evenin’ I dressesmyself out wery smart, and off I goes with the old ’ooman, and upwe walks into a fust-floor where there was tea-things for thirty,and a whole lot o’ women as begins whisperin’ to one another, andlookin’ at me, as if they’d never seen a rayther stout gen’l’m’n ofeight-and-fifty afore. By and by, there comes a great bustledownstairs, and a lanky chap with a red nose and a whiteneckcloth rushes up, and sings out, “Here’s the shepherd a-coming to wisit his faithful flock;” and in comes a fat chap in black,vith a great white face, a-smilin’ avay like clockwork. Such goin’son, Sammy! “The kiss of peace,” says the shepherd; and then hekissed the women all round, and ven he’d done, the man vith thered nose began. I was just a-thinkin’ whether I hadn’t better begintoo―’specially as there was a wery nice lady a-sittin’ next me―venin comes the tea, and your mother-in-law, as had been makin’ thekettle bile downstairs. At it they went, tooth and nail. Such aprecious loud hymn, Sammy, while the tea was a brewing; such agrace, such eatin’ and drinkin’! I wish you could ha’ seen theshepherd walkin’ into the ham and muffins. I never see such achap to eat and drink―never. The red-nosed man warn’t by nomeans the sort of person you’d like to grub by contract, but he wasnothin’ to the shepherd. Well; arter the tea was over, they sanganother hymn, and then the shepherd began to preach: and werywell he did it, considerin’ how heavy them muffins must have liedon his chest. Presently he pulls up, all of a sudden, and hollers out,“Where is the sinner; where is the mis’rable sinner?” Upon which,all the women looked at me, and began to groan as if they was a-dying. I thought it was rather sing’ler, but howsoever, I saysnothing. Presently he pulls up again, and lookin’ wery hard at me,says, “Where is the sinner; where is the mis’rable sinner?” and allthe women groans again, ten times louder than afore. I got rathersavage at this, so I takes a step or two for’ard and says, “Myfriend,” says I, “did you apply that ’ere obserwation to me?” ‘Steadof beggin’ my pardon as any gen’l’m’n would ha’ done, he got moreabusive than ever:―called me a wessel, Sammy―a wessel ofwrath―and all sorts o’ names. So my blood being reg’larly up, Ifirst gave him two or three for himself, and then two or three moreto hand over to the man with the red nose, and walked off. I wishyou could ha’ heard how the women screamed, Sammy, ven theypicked up the shepherd from underneath the table―Hollo! here’sthe governor, the size of life.’</p> 
<p>　　As Mr. Weller spoke, Mr. Pickwick dismounted from a cab, andentered the yard. ‘Fine mornin’, sir,’ said Mr. Weller, senior.</p> 
<p>　　‘Beautiful indeed,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Beautiful indeed,’ echoes a red-haired man with an inquisitivenose and green spectacles, who had unpacked himself from a cabat the same moment as Mr. Pickwick. ‘Going to Ipswich, sir?’</p> 
<p>　　‘I am,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Extraordinary coincidence. So am I.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick bowed.</p> 
<p>　　‘Going outside?’ said the red-haired man. Mr. Pickwick bowedagain.</p> 
<p>　　‘Bless my soul, how remarkable―I am going outside, too,’ saidthe red-haired man; ‘we are positively going together.’ And thered-haired man, who was an important-looking, sharp-nosed,mysterious-spoken personage, with a bird-like habit of giving hishead a jerk every time he said anything, smiled as if he had madeone of the strangest discoveries that ever fell to the lot of humanwisdom.</p> 
<p>　　‘I am happy in the prospect of your company, sir,’ said Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Ah,’ said the new-comer, ‘it’s a good thing for both of us, isn’tit? Company, you see―company―is―is―it’s a very differentthing from solitude―ain’t it?’</p> 
<p>　　‘There’s no denying that ’ere,’ said Mr. Weller, joining in theconversation, with an affable smile. ‘That’s what I call a self-evident proposition, as the dog’s-meat man said, when thehousemaid told him he warn’t a gentleman.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Ah,’ said the red-haired man, surveying Mr. Weller from headto foot with a supercilious look. ‘Friend of yours, sir?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Not exactly a friend,’ replied Mr. Pickwick, in a low tone. ‘Thefact is, he is my servant, but I allow him to take a good manyliberties; for, between ourselves, I flatter myself he is an original,and I am rather proud of him.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Ah,’ said the red-haired man, ‘that, you see, is a matter of taste.</p> 
<p>　　I am not fond of anything original; I don’t like it; don’t see thenecessity for it. What’s your name, sir?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Here is my card, sir,’ replied Mr. Pickwick, much amused bythe abruptness of the question, and the singular manner of thestranger.</p> 
<p>　　‘Ah,’ said the red-haired man, placing the card in his pocket-book, ‘Pickwick; very good. I like to know a man’s name, it savesso much trouble. That’s my card, sir. Magnus, you will perceive,sir―Magnus is my name. It’s rather a good name, I think, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘A very good name, indeed,’ said Mr. Pickwick, wholly unable torepress a smile.</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, I think it is,’ resumed Mr. Magnus. ‘There’s a good namebefore it, too, you will observe. Permit me, sir―if you hold thecard a little slanting, this way, you catch the light upon the up-stroke. There―Peter Magnus―sounds well, I think, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Very,’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Curious circumstance about those initials, sir,’ said Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Magnus. ‘You will observe―P.M.―post meridian. In hasty notesto intimate acquaintance, I sometimes sign myself “Afternoon.” Itamuses my friends very much, Mr. Pickwick.’</p> 
<p>　　‘It is calculated to afford them the highest gratification, I shouldconceive,’ said Mr. Pickwick, rather envying the ease with whichMr. Magnus’s friends were entertained.</p> 
<p>　　‘Now, gen’l’m’n,’ said the hostler, ‘coach is ready, if you please.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Is all my luggage in?’ inquired Mr. Magnus.</p> 
<p>　　‘All right, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Is the red bag in?’</p> 
<p>　　‘All right, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘And the striped bag?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Fore boot, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘And the brown-paper parcel?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Under the seat, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘And the leather hat-box?’</p> 
<p>　　‘They’re all in, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Now, will you get up?’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Excuse me,’ replied Magnus, standing on the wheel. ‘Excuseme, Mr. Pickwick. I cannot consent to get up, in this state ofuncertainty. I am quite satisfied from that man’s manner, that theleather hat-box is not in.’</p> 
<p>　　The solemn protestations of the hostler being whollyunavailing, the leather hat-box was obliged to be raked up fromthe lowest depth of the boot, to satisfy him that it had been safelypacked; and after he had been assured on this head, he felt asolemn presentiment, first, that the red bag was mislaid, and nextthat the striped bag had been stolen, and then that the brown-paper parcel ‘had come untied.’ At length when he had receivedocular demonstration of the groundless nature of each and everyof these suspicions, he consented to climb up to the roof of thecoach, observing that now he had taken everything off his mind,he felt quite comfortable and happy.</p> 
<p>　　‘You’re given to nervousness, ain’t you, sir?’ inquired Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Weller, senior, eyeing the stranger askance, as he mounted to hisplace.</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes; I always am rather about these little matters,’ said thestranger, ‘but I am all right now―quite right.’</p> 
<p>　　 ‘Well, that’s a blessin’, said Mr. Weller. ‘Sammy, help yourmaster up to the box; t’other leg, sir, that’s it; give us your hand,sir. Up with you. You was a lighter weight when you was a boy,sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘True enough, that, Mr. Weller,’ said the breathless Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick good-humouredly, as he took his seat on the box besidehim.</p> 
<p>　　‘Jump up in front, Sammy,’ said Mr. Weller. ‘Now Villam, run’em out. Take care o’ the archvay, gen’l’m’n. “Heads,” as thepieman says. That’ll do, Villam. Let ’em alone.’ And away went thecoach up Whitechapel, to the admiration of the whole populationof that pretty densely populated quarter.</p> 
<p>　　‘Not a wery nice neighbourhood, this, sir,’ said Sam, with atouch of the hat, which always preceded his entering intoconversation with his master.</p> 
<p>　　‘It is not indeed, Sam,’ replied Mr. Pickwick, surveying thecrowded and filthy street through which they were passing.</p> 
<p>　　‘It’s a wery remarkable circumstance, sir,’ said Sam, ‘thatpoverty and oysters always seem to go together.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I don’t understand you, Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘What I mean, sir,’ said Sam, ‘is, that the poorer a place is, thegreater call there seems to be for oysters. Look here, sir; here’s aoyster-stall to every half-dozen houses. The street’s lined vith ’em.</p> 
<p>　　Blessed if I don’t think that ven a man’s wery poor, he rushes outof his lodgings, and eats oysters in reg’lar desperation.’</p> 
<p>　　‘To be sure he does,’ said Mr. Weller, senior; ‘and it’s just thesame vith pickled salmon!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Those are two very remarkable facts, which never occurred tome before,’ said Mr. Pickwick. ‘The very first place we stop at, I’llmake a note of them.’</p> 
<p>　　By this time they had reached the turnpike at Mile End; aprofound silence prevailed until they had got two or three milesfarther on, when Mr. Weller, senior, turning suddenly to Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick, said―‘Wery queer life is a pike-keeper’s, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘A what?’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘A pike-keeper.’</p> 
<p>　　‘What do you mean by a pike-keeper?’ inquired Mr. PeterMagnus.</p> 
<p>　　‘The old ’un means a turnpike-keeper, gen’l’m’n,’ observed Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Samuel Weller, in explanation.</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘I see. Yes; very curious life. Veryuncomfortable.’</p> 
<p>　　‘They’re all on ’em men as has met vith some disappointment inlife,’ said Mr. Weller, senior.</p> 
<p>　　‘Ay, ay,’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes. Consequence of vich, they retires from the world, andshuts themselves up in pikes; partly with the view of beingsolitary, and partly to rewenge themselves on mankind by takin’</p> 
<p>　　tolls.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Dear me,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘I never knew that before.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Fact, sir,’ said Mr. Weller; ‘if they was gen’l’m’n, you’d call ’emmisanthropes, but as it is, they only takes to pike-keepin’.’</p> 
<p>　　With such conversation, possessing the inestimable charm ofblending amusement with instruction, did Mr. Weller beguile thetediousness of the journey, during the greater part of the day.</p> 
<p>　　Topics of conversation were never wanting, for even when anypause occurred in Mr. Weller’s loquacity, it was abundantlysupplied by the desire evinced by Mr. Magnus to make himselfacquainted with the whole of the personal history of his fellow-travellers, and his loudly-expressed anxiety at every stage,respecting the safety and well-being of the two bags, the leatherhat-box, and the brown-paper parcel.</p> 
<p>　　In the main street of Ipswich, on the left-hand side of the way, ashort distance after you have passed through the open spacefronting the Town Hall, stands an inn known far and wide by theappellation of the Great White Horse, rendered the moreconspicuous by a stone statue of some rampacious animal withflowing mane and tail, distantly resembling an insane cart-horse,which is elevated above the principal door. The Great White Horseis famous in the neighbourhood, in the same degree as a prize ox,or a county-paper-chronicled turnip, or unwieldy pig―for itsenormous size. Never was such labyrinths of uncarpeted passages,such clusters of mouldy, ill-lighted rooms, such huge numbers ofsmall dens for eating or sleeping in, beneath any one roof, as arecollected together between the four walls of the Great White Horseat Ipswich.</p> 
<p>　　It was at the door of this overgrown tavern that the Londoncoach stopped, at the same hour every evening; and it was fromthis same London coach that Mr. Pickwick, Sam Weller, and Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Peter Magnus dismounted, on the particular evening to which thischapter of our history bears reference.</p> 
<p>　　‘Do you stop here, sir?’ inquired Mr. Peter Magnus, when thestriped bag, and the red bag, and the brown-paper parcel, and theleather hat-box, had all been deposited in the passage. ‘Do youstop here, sir?’</p> 
<p>　　‘I do,’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Dear me,’ said Mr. Magnus, ‘I never knew anything like theseextraordinary coincidences. Why, I stop here too. I hope we dinetogether?’</p> 
<p>　　‘With pleasure,’ replied Mr. Pickwick. ‘I am not quite certainwhether I have any friends here or not, though. Is there anygentleman of the name of Tupman here, waiter?’</p> 
<p>　　A corpulent man, with a fortnight’s napkin under his arm, andcoeval stockings on his legs, slowly desisted from his occupation ofstaring down the street, on this question being put to him by Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick; and, after minutely inspecting that gentleman’sappearance, from the crown of his hat to the lowest button of hisgaiters, replied emphatically―‘No!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Nor any gentleman of the name of Snodgrass?’ inquired Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘No!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Nor Winkle?’</p> 
<p>　　‘No!’</p> 
<p>　　‘My friends have not arrived to-day, sir,’ said Mr. Pickwick. ‘Wewill dine alone, then. Show us a private room, waiter.’</p> 
<p>　　On this request being preferred, the corpulent mancondescended to order the boots to bring in the gentlemen’sluggage; and preceding them down a long, dark passage, usheredthem into a large, badly-furnished apartment, with a dirty grate, inwhich a small fire was making a wretched attempt to be cheerful,but was fast sinking beneath the dispiriting influence of the place.</p> 
<p>　　After the lapse of an hour, a bit of fish and a steak was served upto the travellers, and when the dinner was cleared away, Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick and Mr. Peter Magnus drew their chairs up to the fire,and having ordered a bottle of the worst possible port wine, at thehighest possible price, for the good of the house, drank brandy-and-water for their own.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Peter Magnus was naturally of a very communicativedisposition, and the brandy-and-water operated with wonderfuleffect in warming into life the deepest hidden secrets of his bosom.</p> 
<p>　　After sundry accounts of himself, his family, his connections, hisfriends, his jokes, his business, and his brothers (most talkativemen have a great deal to say about their brothers), Mr. PeterMagnus took a view of Mr. Pickwick through his colouredspectacles for several minutes, and then said, with an air ofmodesty―‘And what do you think―what do you think, Mr. Pickwick―Ihave come down here for?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Upon my word,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘it is wholly impossible forme to guess; on business, perhaps.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Partly right, sir,’ replied Mr. Peter Magnus, ‘but partly wrongat the same time; try again, Mr. Pickwick.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Really,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘I must throw myself on your mercy,to tell me or not, as you may think best; for I should never guess, ifI were to try all night.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Why , then, he-he-he!’ said Mr. Peter Magnus, with a bashfultitter, ‘what should you think, Mr. Pickwick, if I had come downhere to make a proposal, sir, eh? He, he, he!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Think! That you are very likely to succeed,’ replied Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick, with one of his beaming smiles. ‘Ah!’ said Mr. Magnus.</p> 
<p>　　‘But do you really think so, Mr. Pickwick? Do you, though?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Certainly,’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘No; but you’re joking, though.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I am not, indeed.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Why, then,’ said Mr. Magnus, ‘to let you into a little secret, Ithink so too. I don’t mind telling you, Mr. Pickwick, although I’mdreadful jealous by nature―horrid―that the lady is in this house.’</p> 
<p>　　Here Mr. Magnus took off his spectacles, on purpose to wink, andthen put them on again.</p> 
<p>　　‘That’s what you were running out of the room for, beforedinner, then, so often,’ said Mr. Pickwick archly.</p> 
<p>　　‘Hush! Yes, you’re right, that was it; not such a fool as to seeher, though.’</p> 
<p>　　‘No!’</p> 
<p>　　‘No; wouldn’t do, you know, after having just come off ajourney. Wait till to-morrow, sir; double the chance then. Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick, sir, there is a suit of clothes in that bag, and a hat in thatbox, which, I expect, in the effect they will produce, will beinvaluable to me, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Indeed!’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes; you must have observed my anxiety about them to-day. Ido not believe that such another suit of clothes, and such a hat,could be bought for money, Mr. Pickwick.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick congratulated the fortunate owner of theirresistible garments on their acquisition; and Mr. Peter Magnusremained a few moments apparently absorbed in contemplation.</p> 
<p>　　‘She’s a fine creature,’ said Mr. Magnus.</p> 
<p>　　‘Is she?’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Very,’ said Mr. Magnus. ‘very. She lives about twenty milesfrom here, Mr. Pickwick. I heard she would be here to-night andall to-morrow forenoon, and came down to seize the opportunity. Ithink an inn is a good sort of a place to propose to a single womanin, Mr. Pickwick. She is more likely to feel the loneliness of hersituation in travelling, perhaps, than she would be at home. Whatdo you think, Mr. Pickwick?’</p> 
<p>　　‘I think it is very probable,’ replied that gentleman.</p> 
<p>　　‘I beg your pardon, Mr. Pickwick,’ said Mr. Peter Magnus, ‘but Iam naturally rather curious; what may you have come down herefor?’</p> 
<p>　　‘On a far less pleasant errand, sir,’ replied Mr. Pickwick, thecolour mounting to his face at the recollection. ‘I have come downhere, sir, to expose the treachery and falsehood of an individual,upon whose truth and honour I placed implicit reliance.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Dear me,’ said Mr. Peter Magnus, ‘that’s very unpleasant. It is alady, I presume? Eh? ah! Sly, Mr. Pickwick, sly. Well, Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick, sir, I wouldn’t probe your feelings for the world. Painfulsubjects, these, sir, very painful. Don’t mind me, Mr. Pickwick, ifyou wish to give vent to your feelings. I know what it is to be jilted,sir; I have endured that sort of thing three or four times.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I am much obliged to you, for your condolence on what youpresume to be my melancholy case,’ said Mr. Pickwick, windingup his watch, and laying it on the table, ‘but―’</p> 
<p>　　‘No, no,’ said Mr. Peter Magnus, ‘not a word more; it’s a painfulsubject. I see, I see. What’s the time, Mr. Pickwick?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Past twelve.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Dear me, it’s time to go to bed. It will never do, sitting here. Ishall be pale to-morrow, Mr. Pickwick.’</p> 
<p>　　At the bare notion of such a calamity, Mr. Peter Magnus rangthe bell for the chambermaid; and the striped bag, the red bag, theleathern hat-box, and the brown-paper parcel, having beenconveyed to his bedroom, he retired in company with a japannedcandlestick, to one side of the house, while Mr. Pickwick, andanother japanned candlestick, were conducted through amultitude of tortuous windings, to another.</p> 
<p>　　‘This is your room, sir,’ said the chambermaid.</p> 
<p>　　‘Very well,’ replied Mr. Pickwick, looking round him. It was atolerably large double-bedded room, with a fire; upon the whole, amore comfortable-looking apartment than Mr. Pickwick’s shortexperience of the accommodations of the Great White Horse hadled him to expect.</p> 
<p>　　‘Nobody sleeps in the other bed, of course,’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh, no, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Very good. Tell my servant to bring me up some hot water athalf-past eight in the morning, and that I shall not want him anymore to-night.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, sir,’ and bidding Mr. Pickwick good-night, thechambermaid retired, and left him alone.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick sat himself down in a chair before the fire, and fellinto a train of rambling meditations. First he thought of hisfriends, and wondered when they would join him; then his mindreverted to Mrs. Martha Bardell; and from that lady it wandered,by a natural process, to the dingy counting-house of Dodson &amp;Fogg. From Dodson &amp; Fogg’s it flew off at a tangent, to the verycentre of the history of the queer client; and then it came back tothe Great White Horse at Ipswich, with sufficient clearness toconvince Mr. Pickwick that he was falling asleep. So he rousedhimself, and began to undress, when he recollected he had left hiswatch on the table downstairs.</p> 
<p>　　Now this watch was a special favourite with Mr. Pickwick,having been carried about, beneath the shadow of his waistcoat,for a greater number of years than we feel called upon to state atpresent. The possibility of going to sleep, unless it were tickinggently beneath his pillow, or in the watch-pocket over his head,had never entered Mr. Pickwick’s brain. So as it was pretty latenow, and he was unwilling to ring his bell at that hour of the night,he slipped on his coat, of which he had just divested himself, andtaking the japanned candlestick in his hand, walked quietlydownstairs. The more stairs Mr. Pickwick went down, the morestairs there seemed to be to descend, and again and again, whenMr. Pickwick got into some narrow passage, and began tocongratulate himself on having gained the ground-floor, didanother flight of stairs appear before his astonished eyes. At lasthe reached a stone hall, which he remembered to have seen whenhe entered the house. Passage after passage did he explore; roomafter room did he peep into; at length, as he was on the point ofgiving up the search in despair, he opened the door of the identicalroom in which he had spent the evening, and beheld his missingproperty on the table.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick seized the watch in triumph, and proceeded toretrace his steps to his bedchamber. If his progress downward hadbeen attended with difficulties and uncertainty, his journey backwas infinitely more perplexing. Rows of doors, garnished withboots of every shape, make, and size, branched off in everypossible direction. A dozen times did he softly turn the handle ofsome bedroom door which resembled his own, when a gruff cryfrom within of ‘Who the devil’s that?’ or ‘What do you want here?’</p> 
<p>　　caused him to steal away, on tiptoe, with a perfectly marvellouscelerity. He was reduced to the verge of despair, when an opendoor attracted his attention. He peeped in. Right at last! Therewere the two beds, whose situation he perfectly remembered, andthe fire still burning. His candle, not a long one when he firstreceived it, had flickered away in the drafts of air through whichhe had passed and sank into the socket as he closed the door afterhim. ‘No matter,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘I can undress myself just aswell by the light of the fire.’</p> 
<p>　　The bedsteads stood one on each side of the door; and on theinner side of each was a little path, terminating in a rush-bottomedchair, just wide enough to admit of a person’s getting into or out ofbed, on that side, if he or she thought proper. Having carefullydrawn the curtains of his bed on the outside, Mr. Pickwick satdown on the rush-bottomed chair, and leisurely divested himselfof his shoes and gaiters. He then took off and folded up his coat,waistcoat, and neckcloth, and slowly drawing on his tassellednightcap, secured it firmly on his head, by tying beneath his chinthe strings which he always had attached to that article of dress. Itwas at this moment that the absurdity of his recent bewildermentstruck upon his mind. Throwing himself back in the rush-bottomed chair, Mr. Pickwick laughed to himself so heartily, that itwould have been quite delightful to any man of well-constitutedmind to have watched the smiles that expanded his amiablefeatures as they shone forth from beneath the nightcap.</p> 
<p>　　‘It is the best idea,’ said Mr. Pickwick to himself, smiling till healmost cracked the nightcap strings―‘it is the best idea, my losingmyself in this place, and wandering about these staircases, that Iever heard of. Droll, droll, very droll.’ Here Mr. Pickwick smiledagain, a broader smile than before, and was about to continue theprocess of undressing, in the best possible humour, when he wassuddenly stopped by a most unexpected interruption: to wit, theentrance into the room of some person with a candle, who, afterlocking the door, advanced to the dressing-table, and set down thelight upon it.</p> 
<p>　　The smile that played on Mr. Pickwick’s features wasinstantaneously lost in a look of the most unbounded and wonder-stricken surprise. The person, whoever it was, had come in sosuddenly and with so little noise, that Mr. Pickwick had had notime to call out, or oppose their entrance. Who could it be? Arobber? Some evil-minded person who had seen him comeupstairs with a handsome watch in his hand, perhaps. What washe to do?</p> 
<p>　　The only way in which Mr. Pickwick could catch a glimpse ofhis mysterious visitor with the least danger of being seen himself,was by creeping on to the bed, and peeping out from between thecurtains on the opposite side. To this manoeuvre he accordinglyresorted. Keeping the curtains carefully closed with his hand, sothat nothing more of him could be seen than his face and nightcap,and putting on his spectacles, he mustered up courage and lookedout.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick almost fainted with horror and dismay. Standingbefore the dressing-glass was a middle-aged lady, in yellow curl-papers, busily engaged in brushing what ladies call their ‘back-hair.’ However the unconscious middle-aged lady came into thatroom, it was quite clear that she contemplated remaining there forthe night; for she had brought a rushlight and shade with her,which, with praiseworthy precaution against fire, she hadstationed in a basin on the floor, where it was glimmering away,like a gigantic lighthouse in a particularly small piece of water.</p> 
<p>　　‘Bless my soul!’ thought Mr. Pickwick, ‘what a dreadful thing!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Hem!’ said the lady; and in went Mr. Pickwick’s head withautomaton-like rapidity.</p> 
<p>　　‘I never met with anything so awful as this,’ thought poor Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick, the cold perspiration starting in drops upon hisnightcap. ‘Never. This is fearful.’</p> 
<p>　　It was quite impossible to resist the urgent desire to see whatwas going forward. So out went Mr. Pickwick’s head again. Theprospect was worse than before. The middle-aged lady hadfinished arranging her hair; had carefully enveloped it in a muslinnightcap with a small plaited border; and was gazing pensively onthe fire.</p> 
<p>　　‘This matter is growing alarming,’ reasoned Mr. Pickwick withhimself. ‘I can’t allow things to go on in this way. By the self-possession of that lady, it is clear to me that I must have come intothe wrong room. If I call out she’ll alarm the house; but if I remainhere the consequences will be still more frightful.’ Mr. Pickwick, itis quite unnecessary to say, was one of the most modest anddelicate-minded of mortals. The very idea of exhibiting hisnightcap to a lady overpowered him, but he had tied thoseconfounded strings in a knot, and, do what he would, he couldn’tget it off. The disclosure must be made. There was only one otherway of doing it. He shrunk behind the curtains, and called out veryloudly―‘Ha-hum!’</p> 
<p>　　That the lady started at this unexpected sound was evident, byher falling up against the rushlight shade; that she persuadedherself it must have been the effect of imagination was equallyclear, for when Mr. Pickwick, under the impression that she hadfainted away stone-dead with fright, ventured to peep out again,she was gazing pensively on the fire as before.</p> 
<p>　　‘Most extraordinary female this,’ thought Mr. Pickwick,popping in again. ‘Ha-hum!’</p> 
<p>　　These last sounds, so like those in which, as legends inform us,the ferocious giant Blunderbore was in the habit of expressing hisopinion that it was time to lay the cloth, were too distinctly audibleto be again mistaken for the workings of fancy.</p> 
<p>　　‘Gracious Heaven!’ said the middle-aged lady, ‘what’s that?’</p> 
<p>　　‘It’s―it’s―only a gentleman, ma’am,’ said Mr. Pickwick, frombehind the curtains.</p> 
<p>　　‘A gentleman!’ said the lady, with a terrific scream.</p> 
<p>　　‘It’s all over!’ thought Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘A strange man!’ shrieked the lady. Another instant and thehouse would be alarmed. Her garments rustled as she rushedtowards the door.</p> 
<p>　　‘Ma’am,’ said Mr. Pickwick, thrusting out his head. in theextremity of his desperation, ‘ma’am!’</p> 
<p>　　Now, although Mr. Pickwick was not actuated by any definiteobject in putting out his head, it was instantaneously productive ofa good effect. The lady, as we have already stated, was near thedoor. She must pass it, to reach the staircase, and she would mostundoubtedly have done so by this time, had not the suddenapparition of Mr. Pickwick’s nightcap driven her back into theremotest corner of the apartment, where she stood staring wildlyat Mr. Pickwick, while Mr. Pickwick in his turn stared wildly ather.</p> 
<p>　　‘Wretch,’ said the lady, covering her eyes with her hands, ‘whatdo you want here?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Nothing, ma’am; nothing whatever, ma’am,’ said Mr. Pickwickearnestly.</p> 
<p>　　‘Nothing!’ said the lady, looking up.</p> 
<p>　　‘Nothing, ma’am, upon my honour,’ said Mr. Pickwick, noddinghis head so energetically, that the tassel of his nightcap dancedagain. ‘I am almost ready to sink, ma’am, beneath the confusion ofaddressing a lady in my nightcap (here the lady hastily snatchedoff hers), but I can’t get it off, ma’am (here Mr. Pickwick gave it atremendous tug, in proof of the statement). It is evident to me,ma’am, now, that I have mistaken this bedroom for my own. I hadnot been here five minutes, ma’am, when you suddenly entered it.’</p> 
<p>　　‘If this improbable story be really true, sir,’ said the lady,sobbing violently, ‘you will leave it instantly.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I will, ma’am, with the greatest pleasure,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Instantly, sir,’ said the lady.</p> 
<p>　　‘Certainly, ma’am,’ interposed Mr. Pickwick, very quickly.</p> 
<p>　　‘Certainly, ma’am. I―I―am very sorry, ma’am,’ said Mr. Pickwick,making his appearance at the bottom of the bed, ‘to have been theinnocent occasion of this alarm and emotion; deeply sorry, ma’am.’</p> 
<p>　　The lady pointed to the door. One excellent quality of Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick’s character was beautifully displayed at this moment,under the most trying circumstances. Although he had hastily Puton his hat over his nightcap, after the manner of the old patrol;although he carried his shoes and gaiters in his hand, and his coatand waistcoat over his arm; nothing could subdue his nativepoliteness.</p> 
<p>　　‘I am exceedingly sorry, ma’am,’ said Mr. Pickwick, bowingvery low.</p> 
<p>　　‘If you are, sir, you will at once leave the room,’ said the lady.</p> 
<p>　　‘Immediately, ma’am; this instant, ma’am,’ said Mr. Pickwick,opening the door, and dropping both his shoes with a crash in sodoing.</p> 
<p>　　‘I trust, ma’am,’ resumed Mr. Pickwick, gathering up his shoes,and turning round to bow again―‘I trust, ma’am, that myunblemished character, and the devoted respect I entertain foryour sex, will plead as some slight excuse for this―’ But beforeMr. Pickwick could conclude the sentence, the lady had thrust himinto the passage, and locked and bolted the door behind him.</p> 
<p>　　Whatever grounds of self-congratulation Mr. Pickwick mighthave for having escaped so quietly from his late awkwardsituation, his present position was by no means enviable. He wasalone, in an open passage, in a strange house in the middle of thenight, half dressed; it was not to be supposed that he could find hisway in perfect darkness to a room which he had been whollyunable to discover with a light, and if he made the slightest noisein his fruitless attempts to do so, he stood every chance of beingshot at, and perhaps killed, by some wakeful traveller. He had noresource but to remain where he was until daylight appeared. Soafter groping his way a few paces down the passage, and, to hisinfinite alarm, stumbling over several pairs of boots in so doing,Mr. Pickwick crouched into a little recess in the wall, to wait formorning, as philosophically as he might.</p> 
<p>　　He was not destined, however, to undergo this additional trialof patience; for he had not been long ensconced in his presentconcealment when, to his unspeakable horror, a man, bearing alight, appeared at the end of the passage. His horror was suddenlyconverted into joy, however, when he recognised the form of hisfaithful attendant. It was indeed Mr. Samuel Weller, who aftersitting up thus late, in conversation with the boots, who was sittingup for the mail, was now about to retire to rest.</p> 
<p>　　‘Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick, suddenly appearing before him,‘where’s my bedroom?’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Weller stared at his master with the most emphaticsurprise; and it was not until the question had been repeated threeseveral times, that he turned round, and led the way to the long-sought apartment.</p> 
<p>　　‘Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick, as he got into bed, ‘I have made one ofthe most extraordinary mistakes to-night, that ever were heard of.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Wery likely, sir,’ replied Mr. Weller drily.</p> 
<p>　　‘But of this I am determined, Sam,’ said Mr. Pickwick; ‘that if Iwere to stop in this house for six months, I would never trustmyself about it, alone, again.’</p> 
<p>　　‘That’s the wery prudentest resolution as you could come to,sir,’ replied Mr. Weller. ‘You rayther want somebody to look arteryou, sir, when your judgment goes out a wisitin’.’</p> 
<p>　　‘What do you mean by that, Sam?’ said Mr. Pickwick. He raisedhimself in bed, and extended his hand, as if he were about to saysomething more; but suddenly checking himself, turned round,and bade his valet ‘Good-night.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Good-night, sir,’ replied Mr. Weller. He paused when he gotoutside the door―shook his head―walked on―stopped―snuffedthe candle―shook his head again―and finally proceeded slowly tohis chamber, apparently buried in the profoundest meditation.</p>
