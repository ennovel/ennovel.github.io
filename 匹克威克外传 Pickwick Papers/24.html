<p>　　‘Good-morning, sir,’ said Mr. Peter Magnus. ‘What do you thinkof this, sir?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Very effective indeed,’ replied Mr. Pickwick, surveying thegarments of Mr. Peter Magnus with a good-natured smile.</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, I think it’ll do,’ said Mr. Magnus. ‘Mr. Pickwick, sir, I havesent up my card.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Have you?’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘And the waiter brought back word, that she would see me ateleven―at eleven, sir; it only wants a quarter now.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Very near the time,’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, it is rather near,’ replied Mr. Magnus, ‘rather too near tobe pleasant―eh! Mr. Pickwick, sir?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Confidence is a great thing in these cases,’ observed Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘I believe it is, sir,’ said Mr. Peter Magnus. ‘I am very confident,sir. Really, Mr. Pickwick, I do not see why a man should feel anyfear in such a case as this, sir. What is it, sir? There’s nothing to beashamed of; it’s a matter of mutual accommodation, nothing more.</p> 
<p>　　Husband on one side, wife on the other. That’s my view of thematter, Mr. Pickwick.’</p> 
<p>　　‘It is a very philosophical one,’ replied Mr. Pickwick. ‘Butbreakfast is waiting, Mr. Magnus. Come.’</p> 
<p>　　Down they sat to breakfast, but it was evident, notwithstandingthe boasting of Mr. Peter Magnus, that he laboured under a veryconsiderable degree of nervousness, of which loss of appetite, apropensity to upset the tea-things, a spectral attempt at drollery,and an irresistible inclination to look at the clock, every othersecond, were among the principal symptoms.</p> 
<p>　　‘He-he-he,’ tittered Mr. Magnus, affecting cheerfulness, andgasping with agitation. ‘It only wants two minutes, Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　Am I pale, sir?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Not very,’ replied Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　There was a brief pause.</p> 
<p>　　‘I beg your pardon, Mr. Pickwick; but have you ever done thissort of thing in your time?’ said Mr. Magnus.</p> 
<p>　　‘You mean proposing?’ said Mr. Pickwick. ‘Yes.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Never,’ said Mr. Pickwick, with great energy, ‘never.’</p> 
<p>　　‘You have no idea, then, how it’s best to begin?’ said Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Magnus.</p> 
<p>　　‘Why,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘I may have formed some ideas uponthe subject, but, as I have never submitted them to the test ofexperience, I should be sorry if you were induced to regulate yourproceedings by them.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I should feel very much obliged to you, for any advice, sir,’ saidMr. Magnus, taking another look at the clock, the hand of whichwas verging on the five minutes past.</p> 
<p>　　‘Well, sir,’ said Mr. Pickwick, with the profound solemnity withwhich that great man could, when he pleased, render his remarksso deeply impressive. ‘I should commence, sir, with a tribute to thelady’s beauty and excellent qualities; from them, sir, I shoulddiverge to my own unworthiness.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Very good,’ said Mr. Magnus.</p> 
<p>　　‘Unworthiness for her only, mind, sir,’ resumed Mr. Pickwick;‘for to show that I was not wholly unworthy, sir, I should take abrief review of my past life, and present condition. I should argue,by analogy, that to anybody else, I must be a very desirable object.</p> 
<p>　　I should then expatiate on the warmth of my love, and the depth ofmy devotion. Perhaps I might then be tempted to seize her hand.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, I see,’ said Mr. Magnus; ‘that would be a very great point.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I should then, sir,’ continued Mr. Pickwick, growing warmer asthe subject presented itself in more glowing colours before him―‘Ishould then, sir, come to the plain and simple question, “Will youhave me?” I think I am justified in assuming that upon this, shewould turn away her head.’</p> 
<p>　　‘You think that may be taken for granted?’ said Mr. Magnus;‘because, if she did not do that at the right place, it would beembarrassing.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I think she would,’ said Mr. Pickwick. ‘Upon this, sir, I shouldsqueeze her hand, and I think―I think, Mr. Magnus―that after Ihad done that, supposing there was no refusal, I should gentlydraw away the handkerchief, which my slight knowledge ofhuman nature leads me to suppose the lady would be applying toher eyes at the moment, and steal a respectful kiss. I think I shouldkiss her, Mr. Magnus; and at this particular point, I am decidedlyof opinion that if the lady were going to take me at all, she wouldmurmur into my ears a bashful acceptance.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Magnus started; gazed on Mr. Pickwick’s intelligent face,for a short time in silence; and then (the dial pointing to the tenminutes past) shook him warmly by the hand, and rusheddesperately from the room.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick had taken a few strides to and fro; and the smallhand of the clock following the latter part of his example, hadarrived at the figure which indicates the half-hour, when the doorsuddenly opened. He turned round to meet Mr. Peter Magnus, andencountered, in his stead, the joyous face of Mr. Tupman, theserene countenance of Mr. Winkle, and the intellectual lineamentsof Mr. Snodgrass. As Mr. Pickwick greeted them, Mr. PeterMagnus tripped into the room.</p> 
<p>　　‘My friends, the gentleman I was speaking of―Mr. Magnus,’</p> 
<p>　　said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Your servant, gentlemen,’ said Mr. Magnus, evidently in a highstate of excitement; ‘Mr. Pickwick, allow me to speak to you onemoment, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　As he said this, Mr. Magnus harnessed his forefinger to Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick’s buttonhole, and, drawing him to a window recess,said―‘Congratulate me, Mr. Pickwick; I followed your advice to thevery letter.’</p> 
<p>　　‘And it was all correct, was it?’ inquired Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘It was, sir. Could not possibly have been better,’ replied Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Magnus. ‘Mr. Pickwick, she is mine.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I congratulate you, with all my heart,’ replied Mr. Pickwick,warmly shaking his new friend by the hand.</p> 
<p>　　‘You must see her. sir,’ said Mr. Magnus; ‘this way, if youplease. Excuse us for one instant, gentlemen.’ Hurrying on in thisway, Mr. Peter Magnus drew Mr. Pickwick from the room. Hepaused at the next door in the passage, and tapped gently thereat.</p> 
<p>　　‘Come in,’ said a female voice. And in they went.</p> 
<p>　　‘Miss Witherfield,’ said Mr. Magnus, ‘allow me to introduce myvery particular friend, Mr. Pickwick. Mr. Pickwick, I beg to makeyou known to Miss Witherfield.’</p> 
<p>　　The lady was at the upper end of the room. As Mr. Pickwickbowed, he took his spectacles from his waistcoat pocket, and putthem on; a process which he had no sooner gone through, than,uttering an exclamation of surprise, Mr. Pickwick retreatedseveral paces, and the lady, with a half-suppressed scream, hid herface in her hands, and dropped into a chair; whereupon Mr. PeterMagnus was stricken motionless on the spot, and gazed from oneto the other, with a countenance expressive of the extremities ofhorror and surprise. This certainly was, to all appearance, veryunaccountable behaviour; but the fact is, that Mr. Pickwick nosooner put on his spectacles, than he at once recognised in thefuture Mrs. Magnus the lady into whose room he had sounwarrantably intruded on the previous night; and the spectacleshad no sooner crossed Mr. Pickwick’s nose, than the lady at onceidentified the countenance which she had seen surrounded by allthe horrors of a nightcap. So the lady screamed, and Mr. Pickwickstarted.</p> 
<p>　　‘Mr. Pickwick!’ exclaimed Mr. Magnus, lost in astonishment,‘what is the meaning of this, sir? What is the meaning of it, sir?’</p> 
<p>　　added Mr. Magnus, in a threatening, and a louder tone.</p> 
<p>　　‘Sir,’ said Mr. Pickwick, somewhat indignant at the very suddenmanner in which Mr. Peter Magnus had conjugated himself intothe imperative mood, ‘I decline answering that question.’</p> 
<p>　　‘You decline it, sir?’ said Mr. Magnus.</p> 
<p>　　‘I do, sir,’ replied Mr. Pickwick; ‘I object to say anything whichmay compromise that lady, or awaken unpleasant recollections inher breast, without her consent and permission.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Miss Witherfield,’ said Mr. Peter Magnus, ‘do you know thisperson?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Know him!’ repeated the middle-aged lady, hesitating.</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, know him, ma’am; I said know him,’ replied Mr. Magnus,with ferocity.</p> 
<p>　　‘I have seen him,’ replied the middle-aged lady.</p> 
<p>　　‘Where?’ inquired Mr. Magnus, ‘where?’</p> 
<p>　　‘That,’ said the middle-aged lady, rising from her seat, andaverting her head―‘that I would not reveal for worlds.’</p> 
<p>　　‘I understand you, ma’am,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘and respect yourdelicacy; it shall never be revealed by me depend upon it.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Upon my word, ma’am,’ said Mr. Magnus, ‘considering thesituation in which I am placed with regard to yourself, you carrythis matter off with tolerable coolness―tolerable coolness, ma’am.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Cruel Mr. Magnus!’ said the middle-aged lady; here she weptvery copiously indeed.</p> 
<p>　　‘Address your observations to me, sir,’ interposed Mr. Pickwick;‘I alone am to blame, if anybody be.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Oh! you alone are to blame, are you, sir?’ said Mr. Magnus; ‘I―I―see through this, sir. You repent of your determination now, doyou?’</p> 
<p>　　‘My determination!’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Your determination, sir. Oh! don’t stare at me, sir,’ said Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Magnus; ‘I recollect your words last night, sir. You came downhere, sir, to expose the treachery and falsehood of an individual onwhose truth and honour you had placed implicit reliance―eh?’</p> 
<p>　　Here Mr. Peter Magnus indulged in a prolonged sneer; and takingoff his green spectacles―which he probably found superfluous inhis fit of jealousy―rolled his little eyes about, in a manner frightfulto behold.</p> 
<p>　　‘Eh?’ said Mr. Magnus; and then he repeated the sneer withincreased effect. ‘But you shall answer it, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Answer what?’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Never mind, sir,’ replied Mr. Magnus, striding up and down theroom. ‘Never mind.’</p> 
<p>　　There must be something very comprehensive in this phrase of‘Never mind,’ for we do not recollect to have ever witnessed aquarrel in the street, at a theatre, public room, or elsewhere, inwhich it has not been the standard reply to all belligerentinquiries. ‘Do you call yourself a gentleman, sir?’―‘Never mind,sir.’ ‘Did I offer to say anything to the young woman, sir?’―‘Nevermind, sir.’ ‘Do you want your head knocked up against that wall,sir?’―‘Never mind, sir.’ It is observable, too, that there wouldappear to be some hidden taunt in this universal ‘Never mind,’</p> 
<p>　　which rouses more indignation in the bosom of the individualaddressed, than the most lavish abuse could possibly awaken.</p> 
<p>　　We do not mean to assert that the application of this brevity tohimself, struck exactly that indignation to Mr. Pickwick’s soul,which it would infallibly have roused in a vulgar breast. We merelyrecord the fact that Mr. Pickwick opened the room door, andabruptly called out, ‘Tupman, come here!’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Tupman immediately presented himself, with a look of veryconsiderable surprise.</p> 
<p>　　‘Tupman,’ said Mr. Pickwick, ‘a secret of some delicacy, inwhich that lady is concerned, is the cause of a difference whichhas just arisen between this gentleman and myself. When I assurehim, in your presence, that it has no relation to himself, and is notin any way connected with his affairs, I need hardly beg you totake notice that if he continue to dispute it, he expresses a doubt ofmy veracity, which I shall consider extremely insulting.’ As Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick said this, he looked encyclopedias at Mr. Peter Magnus.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick’s upright and honourable bearing, coupled withthat force and energy of speech which so eminently distinguishedhim, would have carried conviction to any reasonable mind; but,unfortunately, at that particular moment, the mind of Mr. PeterMagnus was in anything but reasonable order. Consequently,instead of receiving Mr. Pickwick’s explanation as he ought tohave done, he forthwith proceeded to work himself into a red-hot,scorching, consuming passion, and to talk about what was due tohis own feelings, and all that sort of thing; adding force to hisdeclamation by striding to and fro, and pulling his hair―amusements which he would vary occasionally, by shaking his fistin Mr. Pickwick’s philanthropic countenance.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick, in his turn, conscious of his own innocence andrectitude, and irritated by having unfortunately involved themiddle-aged lady in such an unpleasant affair, was not so quietlydisposed as was his wont. The consequence was, that words ranhigh, and voices higher; and at length Mr. Magnus told Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick he should hear from him; to which Mr. Pickwick replied,with laudable politeness, that the sooner he heard from him thebetter; whereupon the middle-aged lady rushed in terror from theroom, out of which Mr. Tupman dragged Mr. Pickwick, leavingMr. Peter Magnus to himself and meditation.</p> 
<p>　　If the middle-aged lady had mingled much with the busy world,or had profited at all by the manners and customs of those whomake the laws and set the fashions, she would have known thatthis sort of ferocity is the most harmless thing in nature; but as shehad lived for the most part in the country, and never read theparliamentary debates, she was little versed in these particularrefinements of civilised life. Accordingly, when she had gained herbedchamber, bolted herself in, and began to meditate on the sceneshe had just witnessed, the most terrific pictures of slaughter anddestruction presented themselves to her imagination; amongwhich, a full-length portrait of Mr. Peter Magnus borne home byfour men, with the embellishment of a whole barrelful of bullets inhis left side, was among the very least. The more the middle-agedlady meditated, the more terrified she became; and at length shedetermined to repair to the house of the principal magistrate ofthe town, and request him to secure the persons of Mr. Pickwickand Mr. Tupman without delay.</p> 
<p>　　To this decision the middle-aged lady was impelled by a varietyof considerations, the chief of which was the incontestable proof itwould afford of her devotion to Mr. Peter Magnus, and her anxietyfor his safety. She was too well acquainted with his jealoustemperament to venture the slightest allusion to the real cause ofher agitation on beholding Mr. Pickwick; and she trusted to herown influence and power of persuasion with the little man, to quellhis boisterous jealousy, supposing that Mr. Pickwick wereremoved, and no fresh quarrel could arise. Filled with thesereflections, the middle-aged lady arrayed herself in her bonnetand shawl, and repaired to the mayor’s dwelling straightway.</p> 
<p>　　Now George Nupkins, Esquire, the principal magistrateaforesaid, was as grand a personage as the fastest walker wouldfind out, between sunrise and sunset, on the twenty-first of June,which being, according to the almanacs, the longest day in thewhole year, would naturally afford him the longest period for hissearch. On this particular morning, Mr. Nupkins was in a state ofthe utmost excitement and irritation, for there had been arebellion in the town; all the day-scholars at the largest day-schoolhad conspired to break the windows of an obnoxious apple-seller,and had hooted the beadle and pelted the constabulary―anelderly gentleman in top-boots, who had been called out to repressthe tumult, and who had been a peace-officer, man and boy, forhalf a century at least. And Mr. Nupkins was sitting in his easy-chair, frowning with majesty, and boiling with rage, when a ladywas announced on pressing, private, and particular business. Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Nupkins looked calmly terrible, and commanded that the ladyshould be shown in; which command, like all the mandates ofemperors, and magistrates, and other great potentates of theearth, was forthwith obeyed; and Miss Witherfield, interestinglyagitated, was ushered in accordingly.</p> 
<p>　　‘Muzzle!’ said the magistrate.</p> 
<p>　　Muzzle was an undersized footman, with a long body and shortlegs.</p> 
<p>　　‘Muzzle!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, your Worship.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Place a chair, and leave the room.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, your Worship.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Now, ma’am, will you state your business?’ said the magistrate.</p> 
<p>　　‘It is of a very painful kind, sir,’ said Miss Witherfield.</p> 
<p>　　‘Very likely, ma’am,’ said the magistrate. ‘Compose yourfeelings, ma’am.’ Here Mr. Nupkins looked benignant. ‘And thentell me what legal business brings you here, ma’am.’ Here themagistrate triumphed over the man; and he looked stern again.</p> 
<p>　　‘It is very distressing to me, sir, to give this information,’ saidMiss Witherfield, ‘but I fear a duel is going to be fought here.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Here, ma’am?’ said the magistrate. ‘Where, ma’am?’</p> 
<p>　　‘In Ipswich.’</p> 
<p>　　‘In Ipswich, ma’am! A duel in Ipswich!’ said the magistrate,perfectly aghast at the notion. ‘Impossible, ma’am; nothing of thekind can be contemplated in this town, I am persuaded. Bless mysoul, ma’am, are you aware of the activity of our local magistracy?</p> 
<p>　　Do you happen to have heard, ma’am, that I rushed into a prize-ring on the fourth of May last, attended by only sixty specialconstables; and, at the hazard of falling a sacrifice to the angrypassions of an infuriated multitude, prohibited a pugilistic contestbetween the Middlesex Dumpling and the Suffolk Bantam? A duelin Ipswich, ma’am? I don’t think―I do not think,’ said themagistrate, reasoning with himself, ‘that any two men can havehad the hardihood to plan such a breach of the peace, in thistown.’</p> 
<p>　　‘My information is, unfortunately, but too correct,’ said themiddle-aged lady; ‘I was present at the quarrel.’</p> 
<p>　　‘It’s a most extraordinary thing,’ said the astounded magistrate.</p> 
<p>　　‘Muzzle!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, your Worship.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Send Mr. Jinks here, directly! Instantly.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, your Worship.’</p> 
<p>　　Muzzle retired; and a pale, sharp-nosed, half-fed, shabbily-cladclerk, of middle age, entered the room.</p> 
<p>　　‘Mr. Jinks,’ said the magistrate. ‘Mr. Jinks.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Sir,’ said Mr. Jinks. ‘This lady, Mr. Jinks, has come here, togive information of an intended duel in this town.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Jinks, not knowing exactly what to do, smiled adependent’s smile.</p> 
<p>　　‘What are you laughing at, Mr. Jinks?’ said the magistrate.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Jinks looked serious instantly.</p> 
<p>　　‘Mr. Jinks,’ said the magistrate, ‘you’re a fool.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Jinks looked humbly at the great man, and bit the top of hispen.</p> 
<p>　　‘You may see something very comical in this information, sir―but I can tell you this, Mr. Jinks, that you have very little to laughat,’ said the magistrate.</p> 
<p>　　The hungry-looking Jinks sighed, as if he were quite aware ofthe fact of his having very little indeed to be merry about; and,being ordered to take the lady’s information, shambled to a seat,and proceeded to write it down.</p> 
<p>　　‘This man, Pickwick, is the principal, I understand?’ said themagistrate, when the statement was finished.</p> 
<p>　　‘He is,’ said the middle-aged lady.</p> 
<p>　　‘And the other rioter―what’s his name, Mr. Jinks?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Tupman, sir.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Tupman is the second?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes.’</p> 
<p>　　‘The other principal, you say, has absconded, ma’am?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes,’ replied Miss Witherfield, with a short cough.</p> 
<p>　　‘Very well,’ said the magistrate. ‘These are two cut-throats fromLondon, who have come down here to destroy his Majesty’spopulation, thinking that at this distance from the capital, the armof the law is weak and paralysed. They shall be made an exampleof. Draw up the warrants, Mr. Jinks. Muzzle!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, your Worship.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Is Grummer downstairs?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, your Worship.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Send him up.’ The obsequious Muzzle retired, and presentlyreturned, introducing the elderly gentleman in the top-boots, whowas chiefly remarkable for a bottle-nose, a hoarse voice, a snuff-coloured surtout, and a wandering eye.</p> 
<p>　　‘Grummer,’ said the magistrate.</p> 
<p>　　‘Your wash-up.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Is the town quiet now?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Pretty well, your wash-up,’ replied Grummer. ‘Pop’lar feelinghas in a measure subsided, consekens o’ the boys having dispersedto cricket.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Nothing but vigorous measures will do in these times,Grummer,’ said the magistrate, in a determined manner. ‘If theauthority of the king’s officers is set at naught, we must have theriot act read. If the civil power cannot protect these windows,Grummer, the military must protect the civil power, and thewindows too. I believe that is a maxim of the constitution, Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Jinks?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Certainly, sir,’ said Jinks.</p> 
<p>　　‘Very good,’ said the magistrate, signing the warrants.</p> 
<p>　　‘Grummer, you will bring these persons before me, this afternoon.</p> 
<p>　　You will find them at the Great White Horse. You recollect thecase of the Middlesex Dumpling and the Suffolk Bantam,Grummer?’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Grummer intimated, by a retrospective shake of the head,that he should never forget it―as indeed it was not likely hewould, so long as it continued to be cited daily.</p> 
<p>　　‘This is even more unconstitutional,’ said the magistrate; ‘this iseven a greater breach of the peace, and a grosser infringement ofhis Majesty’s prerogative. I believe duelling is one of his Majesty’smost undoubted prerogatives, Mr. Jinks?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Expressly stipulated in Magna Charta, sir,’ said Mr. Jinks.</p> 
<p>　　‘One of the brightest jewels in the British crown, wrung fromhis Majesty by the barons, I believe, Mr. Jinks?’ said themagistrate.</p> 
<p>　　‘Just so, sir,’ replied Mr. Jinks.</p> 
<p>　　‘Very well,’ said the magistrate, drawing himself up proudly, ‘itshall not be violated in this portion of his dominions. Grummer,procure assistance, and execute these warrants with as little delayas possible. Muzzle!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Yes, your Worship.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Show the lady out.’</p> 
<p>　　Miss Witherfield retired, deeply impressed with themagistrate’s learning and research; Mr. Nupkins retired to lunch;Mr. Jinks retired within himself―that being the only retirementhe had, except the sofa-bedstead in the small parlour which wasoccupied by his landlady’s family in the daytime―and Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Grummer retired, to wipe out, by his mode of discharging hispresent commission, the insult which had been fastened uponhimself, and the other representative of his Majesty―the beadle―in the course of the morning.</p> 
<p>　　While these resolute and determined preparations for theconservation of the king’s peace were pending, Mr. Pickwick andhis friends, wholly unconscious of the mighty events in progress,had sat quietly down to dinner; and very talkative andcompanionable they all were. Mr. Pickwick was in the very act ofrelating his adventure of the preceding night, to the greatamusement of his followers, Mr. Tupman especially, when thedoor opened, and a somewhat forbidding countenance peeped intothe room. The eyes in the forbidding countenance looked veryearnestly at Mr. Pickwick, for several seconds, and were to allappearance satisfied with their investigation; for the body to whichthe forbidding countenance belonged, slowly brought itself intothe apartment, and presented the form of an elderly individual intop-boots―not to keep the reader any longer in suspense, in short,the eyes were the wandering eyes of Mr. Grummer, and the bodywas the body of the same gentleman.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Grummer’s mode of proceeding was professional, butpeculiar. His first act was to bolt the door on the inside; hissecond, to polish his head and countenance very carefully with acotton handkerchief; his third, to place his hat, with the cottonhandkerchief in it, on the nearest chair; and his fourth, to producefrom the breast-pocket of his coat a short truncheon, surmountedby a brazen crown, with which he beckoned to Mr. Pickwick witha grave and ghost-like air.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Snodgrass was the first to break the astonished silence. Helooked steadily at Mr. Grummer for a brief space, and then saidemphatically, ‘This is a private room, sir. A private room.’</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Grummer shook his head, and replied, ‘No room’s privateto his Majesty when the street door’s once passed. That’s law.</p> 
<p>　　Some people maintains that an Englishman’s house is his castle.</p> 
<p>　　That’s gammon.’</p> 
<p>　　The Pickwickians gazed on each other with wondering eyes.</p> 
<p>　　‘Which is Mr. Tupman?’ inquired Mr. Grummer. He had anintuitive perception of Mr. Pickwick; he knew him at once.</p> 
<p>　　‘My name’s Tupman,’ said that gentleman.</p> 
<p>　　‘My name’s Law,’ said Mr. Grummer.</p> 
<p>　　‘What?’ said Mr. Tupman.</p> 
<p>　　‘Law,’ replied Mr. Grummer―‘Law, civil power, and exekative;them’s my titles; here’s my authority. Blank Tupman, blankPickwick―against the peace of our sufferin’ lord the king―stattitin the case made and purwided―and all regular. I apprehend youPickwick! Tupman―the aforesaid.’</p> 
<p>　　‘What do you mean by this insolence?’ said Mr. Tupman,starting up; ‘leave the room!’</p> 
<p>　　‘Hollo,’ said Mr. Grummer, retreating very expeditiously to thedoor, and opening it an inch or two, ‘Dubbley.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Well,’ said a deep voice from the passage.</p> 
<p>　　‘Come for’ard, Dubbley.’</p> 
<p>　　At the word of command, a dirty-faced man, something over sixfeet high, and stout in proportion, squeezed himself through thehalf-open door (making his face very red in the process), andentered the room.</p> 
<p>　　‘Is the other specials outside, Dubbley?’ inquired Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Grummer.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Dubbley, who was a man of few words, nodded assent.</p> 
<p>　　‘Order in the diwision under your charge, Dubbley,’ said Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Grummer.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Dubbley did as he was desired; and half a dozen men, eachwith a short truncheon and a brass crown, flocked into the room.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Grummer pocketed his staff, and looked at Mr. Dubbley; Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Dubbley pocketed his staff and looked at the division; the divisionpocketed their staves and looked at Messrs. Tupman andPickwick.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick and his followers rose as one man.</p> 
<p>　　‘What is the meaning of this atrocious intrusion upon myprivacy?’ said Mr. Pickwick.</p> 
<p>　　‘Who dares apprehend me?’ said Mr. Tupman.</p> 
<p>　　‘What do you want here, scoundrels?’ said Mr. Snodgrass.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Winkle said nothing, but he fixed his eyes on Grummer,and bestowed a look upon him, which, if he had had any feeling,must have pierced his brain. As it was, however, it had no visibleeffect on him whatever.</p> 
<p>　　When the executive perceived that Mr. Pickwick and his friendswere disposed to resist the authority of the law, they verysignificantly turned up their coat sleeves, as if knocking themdown in the first instance, and taking them up afterwards, were amere professional act which had only to be thought of to be done,as a matter of course. This demonstration was not lost upon Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Pickwick. He conferred a few moments with Mr. Tupman apart,and then signified his readiness to proceed to the mayor’sresidence, merely begging the parties then and there assembled,to take notice, that it was his firm intention to resent thismonstrous invasion of his privileges as an Englishman, the instanthe was at liberty; whereat the parties then and there assembledlaughed very heartily, with the single exception of Mr. Grummer,who seemed to consider that any slight cast upon the divine rightof magistrates was a species of blasphemy not to be tolerated.</p> 
<p>　　But when Mr. Pickwick had signified his readiness to bow tothe laws of his country, and just when the waiters, and hostlers,and chambermaids, and post-boys, who had anticipated adelightful commotion from his threatened obstinacy, began to turnaway, disappointed and disgusted, a difficulty arose which had notbeen foreseen. With every sentiment of veneration for theconstituted authorities, Mr. Pickwick resolutely protested againstmaking his appearance in the public streets, surrounded andguarded by the officers of justice, like a common criminal. Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Grummer, in the then disturbed state of public feeling (for it washalf-holiday, and the boys had not yet gone home), as resolutelyprotested against walking on the opposite side of the way, andtaking Mr. Pickwick’s parole that he would go straight to themagistrate’s; and both Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Tupman asstrenuously objected to the expense of a post-coach, which was theonly respectable conveyance that could be obtained. The disputeran high, and the dilemma lasted long; and just as the executivewere on the point of overcoming Mr. Pickwick’s objection towalking to the magistrate’s, by the trite expedient of carrying himthither, it was recollected that there stood in the inn yard, an oldsedan-chair, which, having been originally built for a goutygentleman with funded property, would hold Mr. Pickwick andMr. Tupman, at least as conveniently as a modern post-chaise. Thechair was hired, and brought into the hall; Mr. Pickwick and Mr.</p> 
<p>　　Tupman squeezed themselves inside, and pulled down the blinds;a couple of chairmen were speedily found; and the processionstarted in grand order. The specials surrounded the body of thevehicle; Mr. Grummer and Mr. Dubbley marched triumphantly infront; Mr. Snodgrass and Mr. Winkle walked arm-in-arm behind;and the unsoaped of Ipswich brought up the rear.</p> 
<p>　　The shopkeepers of the town, although they had a veryindistinct notion of the nature of the offence, could not but bemuch edified and gratified by this spectacle. Here was the strongarm of the law, coming down with twenty gold-beater force, upontwo offenders from the metropolis itself; the mighty engine wasdirected by their own magistrate, and worked by their ownofficers; and both the criminals, by their united efforts, weresecurely shut up, in the narrow compass of one sedan-chair. Manywere the expressions of approval and admiration which greetedMr. Grummer, as he headed the cavalcade, staff in hand; loud andlong were the shouts raised by the unsoaped; and amidst theseunited testimonials of public approbation, the procession movedslowly and majestically along.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Weller, habited in his morning jacket, with the black calicosleeves, was returning in a rather desponding state from anunsuccessful survey of the mysterious house with the green gate,when, raising his eyes, he beheld a crowd pouring down the street,surrounding an object which had very much the appearance of asedan-chair. Willing to divert his thoughts from the failure of hisenterprise, he stepped aside to see the crowd pass; and findingthat they were cheering away, very much to their own satisfaction,forthwith began (by way of raising his spirits) to cheer too, with allhis might and main.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Grummer passed, and Mr. Dubbley passed, and the sedanpassed, and the bodyguard of specials passed, and Sam was stillresponding to the enthusiastic cheers of the mob, and waving hishat about as if he were in the very last extreme of the wildest joy(though, of course, he had not the faintest idea of the matter inhand), when he was suddenly stopped by the unexpectedappearance of Mr. Winkle and Mr. Snodgrass.</p> 
<p>　　‘What’s the row, gen’l’m’n?’ cried Sam. ‘Who have they got inthis here watch-box in mournin’?’</p> 
<p>　　Both gentlemen replied together, but their words were lost inthe tumult.</p> 
<p>　　‘Who is it?’ cried Sam again.</p> 
<p>　　once more was a joint reply returned; and, though the wordswere inaudible, Sam saw by the motion of the two pairs of lips thatthey had uttered the magic word ‘Pickwick.’</p> 
<p>　　This was enough. In another minute Mr. Weller had made hisway through the crowd, stopped the chairmen, and confronted theportly Grummer.</p> 
<p>　　‘Hollo, old gen’l’m’n!’ said Sam. ‘Who have you got in this hereconweyance?’</p> 
<p>　　‘Stand back,’ said Mr. Grummer, whose dignity, like the dignityof a great many other men, had been wondrously augmented by alittle popularity.</p> 
<p>　　‘Knock him down, if he don’t,’ said Mr. Dubbley.</p> 
<p>　　‘I’m wery much obliged to you, old gen’l’m’n,’ replied Sam, ‘forconsulting my conwenience, and I’m still more obliged to the othergen’l’m’n, who looks as if he’d just escaped from a giant’scarrywan, for his wery ’andsome suggestion; but I should preferyour givin’ me a answer to my question, if it’s all the same toyou.―How are you, sir?’ This last observation was addressed witha patronising air to Mr. Pickwick, who was peeping through thefront window.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Grummer, perfectly speechless with indignation, draggedthe truncheon with the brass crown from its particular pocket, andflourished it before Sam’s eyes.</p> 
<p>　　‘Ah,’ said Sam, ‘it’s wery pretty, ’specially the crown, which isuncommon like the real one.’</p> 
<p>　　‘Stand back!’ said the outraged Mr. Grummer. By way ofadding force to the command, he thrust the brass emblem ofroyalty into Sam’s neckcloth with one hand, and seized Sam’scollar with the other―a compliment which Mr. Weller returned byknocking him down out of hand, having previously with theutmost consideration, knocked down a chairman for him to lieupon.</p> 
<p>　　Whether Mr. Winkle was seized with a temporary attack of thatspecies of insanity which originates in a sense of injury, oranimated by this display of Mr. Weller’s valour, is uncertain; butcertain it is, that he no sooner saw Mr. Grummer fall than he madea terrific onslaught on a small boy who stood next him; whereuponMr. Snodgrass, in a truly Christian spirit, and in order that hemight take no one unawares, announced in a very loud tone thathe was going to begin, and proceeded to take off his coat with theutmost deliberation. He was immediately surrounded andsecured; and it is but common justice both to him and Mr. Winkleto say, that they did not make the slightest attempt to rescueeither themselves or Mr. Weller; who, after a most vigorousresistance, was overpowered by numbers and taken prisoner. Theprocession then reformed; the chairmen resumed their stations;and the march was re-commenced.</p> 
<p>　　Mr. Pickwick’s indignation during the whole of this proceedingwas beyond all bounds. He could just see Sam upsetting thespecials, and flying about in every direction; and that was all hecould see, for the sedan doors wouldn’t open, and the blindswouldn’t pull up. At length, with the assistance of Mr. Tupman, hemanaged to push open the roof; and mounting on the seat, andsteadying himself as well as he could, by placing his hand on thatgentleman’s shoulder, Mr. Pickwick proceeded to address themultitude; to dwell upon the unjustifiable manner in which he hadbeen treated; and to call upon them to take notice that his servanthad been first assaulted. In this order they reached themagistrate’s house; the chairmen trotting, the prisoners following,Mr. Pickwick oratorising, and the crowd shouting.</p>
