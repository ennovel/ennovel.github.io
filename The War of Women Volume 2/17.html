<br> 
<br> Instantly the noisy crowd which was besieging Président Lalasne's house to have a sight of Madame de Condé turned their heads in the direction from which the uproar seemed to proceed, and, with little heed to the laws of etiquette, began to melt away. The explanation of their action was not far to seek. They had already seen Madame la Princesse ten, twenty, perhaps a hundred times, while there was a promise of something new and unfamiliar in this noise which was coming constantly nearer.
<br> 
<br> "They are honest at least," murmured Lenet, with a smile, from behind the indignant princess. "But what is the meaning of all this music and shouting? I confess that I am almost as eager to know as yonder wretched courtiers."
<br> 
<br> "Very well," said the princess, "do you too, leave me, and go running about the streets with them."
<br> 
<br> "I would do it upon the instant, madame," said Lenet, "if I were sure of bringing you good news."
<br> 
<br> "Oh! as for good news," said the princess, with an ironical glance, apparently directed to the glorious blue sky over her head, "I hardly expect anything of the sort. We are not in a lucky vein."
<br> 
<br> "Madame," said Lenet, "you know that I am not easily deceived; I am very much mistaken, however, if all this noise does not mean that something favorable has happened."
<br> 
<br> Indeed the joyous character of the constantly increasing uproar, and the appearance of an excited multitude at the end of the street, with arms and handkerchiefs waving in the air, convinced the princess herself that what she was about to hear must be good news. She listened therefore with an eager attention which made her forget for a moment the desertion of her admirers, and distinguished these words:—
<br> 
<br> "Braune! the governor of Braune! the governor's a prisoner!"
<br> 
<br> "Aha!" said Lenet, "the governor of Braune a prisoner! That's not half bad. In him we have a hostage whom we can hold to answer for Richon."
<br> 
<br> "Have we not the governor of ?le Saint-Georges?" said the princess.
<br> 
<br> "I am very happy," said Madame de Tourville, "that my plan for taking Braune has succeeded so well."
<br> 
<br> "Madame," said Lenet, "let us not flatter ourselves yet upon so complete a victory; chance mocks at the plans of man, sometimes even at the plans of woman."
<br> 
<br> "But; monsieur," retorted Madame de Tourville, bristling up as usual, "if the governor is taken, the place must be taken."
<br> 
<br> "Your logic is not absolutely unanswerable, madame; but have no fear that I shall not be the first to congratulate you, if to you we owe a twofold result of such importance."
<br> 
<br> "The most surprising thing to me in all this," said the princess, beginning to cast about already for something, in the anticipated good news, wounding to the aristocratic pride which was her most prominent characteristic,—"the most surprising thing to me is that I was not the first person to be informed of what had taken place; it is an unpardonable neglect of propriety, like everything that Monsieur le Duc de La Rochefoucauld does."
<br> 
<br> "Why, madame," said Lenet, "we haven't soldiers enough to do the fighting, and yet you would have us take some of them from their posts to make couriers of them! Alas! let us not be too exacting, and when good news arrives, let us take it as God sends it, and not ask how it came."
<br> 
<br> Meanwhile the crowd continued to increase in size, as all the detached groups joined the main body, even as the small streams flow into a great river. In the centre of this main body, composed of perhaps a thousand persons, was a little knot of soldiers, thirty men at most, and, surrounded by these thirty men, a prisoner whom they seemed to be protecting from the fury of the mob.
<br> 
<br> "Death! death!" cried the populace; "death to the governor of Braune!"
<br> 
<br> "Ah!" exclaimed the princess, with a triumphant smile, "it seems that they really have a prisoner, and that the prisoner is the governor of Braune!"
<br> 
<br> "Yes," said Lenet; "but look, madame; it seems also that the prisoner's life is in danger. Do you hear the threats? Do you see the fierce gestures? Why, madame, they are trying to force their way through the soldiers; they mean to tear him in pieces! Oh! the tigers, they smell the flesh, and thirst for blood!"
<br> 
<br> "Well, let them drink it!" said the princess, with the ferocity peculiar to women when their bad passions are aroused; "let them drink it! it's the blood of an enemy."
<br> 
<br> "Madame," said Lenet, "yonder prisoner is under safeguard of the honor of the Condés, remember that; and furthermore, who can say that at this moment Richon, our gallant Richon, is not exposed to the same danger as this poor wretch? Ah! they will force the soldiers back; if they reach him, he is lost! Twenty volunteers this way!" cried Lenet, turning about. "Twenty volunteers to help in driving back this canaille! If a hair on the prisoner's head is injured, your heads will answer for it; go!"
<br> 
<br> At the word, twenty musketeers of the civic guard, belonging to the best families of the city, rushed like a torrent down the stairs, forced the crowd aside by dint of dealing blows right and left with clubbed muskets, and reinforced the escort. It was high time, for a few claws, longer and sharper than the rest, had already torn some pieces from the prisoner's blue coat.
<br> 
<br> "I' faith, messieurs, I thank you," said the prisoner, "for you came just in time to prevent my being devoured by these cannibals; it was very well done of you. Peste! if they eat men up in this way, on the day that the royal army attempts an assault upon your city they will devour it raw."
<br> 
<br> With that he shrugged his shoulders carelessly and began to laugh.
<br> 
<br> "Ah! he's a brave man!" cried the crowd, observant of the somewhat artificial calmness of the prisoner; and they repeated the pleasantry, which flattered his self-esteem. "He's a true hero! he's not afraid. Long live the governor of Braune!"
<br> 
<br> "Gad, yes!" cried the prisoner, "long live the governor of Braune! That would suit me wonderfully well."
<br> 
<br> In a twinkling the popular rage changed to admiration, and this last sentiment was expressed in most emphatic terms. A veritable ovation took the place of the threatened martyrdom of the governor of Braune, in other words, of our old friend Cauvignac. For as our readers have undoubtedly guessed ere this, it was Cauvignac who was making this melancholy entry into the capital of Guyenne.
<br> 
<br> Meanwhile, protected by his guards, and by his presence of mind, the prisoner of war was taken to the house of Président Lalasne, and was haled before the princess by half of the escort, while the other half stood guard at the door.
<br> 
<br> Cauvignac entered Madame de Condé's apartment with proud and tranquil bearing; but truth compels us to state that his heart was beating wildly beneath this heroic exterior.
<br> 
<br> At the first glance he was recognized, despite the deplorable condition in which the mob had left his fine blue coat, his gold lace, and his feather.
<br> 
<br> "Monsieur Cauvignac!" cried Lenet.
<br> 
<br> "Monsieur Cauvignac, governor of Braune!" added the princess. "Ah! monsieur, this much resembles downright treason."
<br> 
<br> "What said your Highness?" queried Cauvignac, realizing that now, if ever, he must summon to his aid all his impudence, and all his wit. "I thought that I heard the word 'treason'!"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, monsieur, treason; for what is this title under which you appear before me?"
<br> 
<br> "The title of governor of Braune, madame."
<br> 
<br> "Treason, as you see. By whom is your commission signed?"
<br> 
<br> "By Monsieur de Mazarin."
<br> 
<br> "Treason! two-fold treason, as I said! You are governor of Braune, and it was your company that surrendered Vayres; the title was the fitting reward of the base deed."
<br> 
<br> At these words Cauvignac's face expressed the most unbounded amazement. He looked all about, as if seeking the person to whom this extraordinary language was addressed; and convinced at last that the princess's accusation was aimed at no other than himself, he let his hands fall by his sides with a despairing gesture.
<br> 
<br> "My company surrendered Vayres!" he exclaimed. "Does your Highness make such a charge against me?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, monsieur, I do. Pretend to know nothing of it; affect amazement; you are evidently a clever comedian; but you will not make me the dupe of your grimaces or your words, although they harmonize so perfectly with one another."
<br> 
<br> "I pretend nothing, madame. How can your Highness say that I know what took place at Vayres, when I have never been there?"
<br> 
<br> "Subterfuge, monsieur, subterfuge!"
<br> 
<br> "I have nothing to say in reply to such words, madame, except that your Highness seems displeased with me. I pray your Highness to forgive the frankness of my character for the freedom with which I make bold to defend myself,—I was of the opinion that I had reason to complain of you."
<br> 
<br> "To complain of me, monsieur!" cried the princess, amazed at his audacity.
<br> 
<br> "Most assuredly, madame," rejoined Cauvignac, with undiminished self-possession; "relying upon your word and that of Monsieur Lenet here present, I levy a company of gallant fellows, and I enter into agreements with them, which are the more sacred in that they are in almost every instance merely verbal agreements. And lo! when I ask your Highness for the amount agreed upon,—a mere trifle, thirty or forty thousand livres,—to be used, not for myself, observe, but for the new defenders of the cause of Messieurs les Princes recruited by me, your Highness refuses to give them to me; yes, refuses me! I appeal to Monsieur Lenet."
<br> 
<br> "It is true," said Lenet; "when monsieur made his demand, we had no money."
<br> 
<br> "And could you not wait a few days, monsieur? Was your fidelity and that of your men a matter of a moment?"
<br> 
<br> "I waited the length of time that Monsieur de La Rochefoucauld himself asked me to wait, madame,—a week. At the end of the week I made my appearance again, and was then met with a formal refusal; once more I appeal to Monsieur Lenet."
<br> 
<br> The princess turned to her adviser with compressed lips, and eyes darting fire from beneath her frowning brow.
<br> 
<br> "Unfortunately," said Lenet, "I am forced to admit that what monsieur says is the exact truth."
<br> 
<br> Cauvignac drew himself up triumphantly.
<br> 
<br> "Tell me, madame," said he, "what would a schemer have done under such circumstances? He would have sold himself and his men to the queen. But I, who have a horror of intrigue, dismissed my company, and released every man from his agreement; and, being left entirely alone, I maintained absolute neutrality; I did what the sage advises the man who is in doubt to do,—I held aloof."
<br> 
<br> "But your soldiers, monsieur, your soldiers!" cried the princess, excitedly.
<br> 
<br> "Madame," Cauvignac retorted, "as I am neither king nor prince, but a simple captain; as I have neither subjects nor vassals, I call no soldiers mine, save those whom I pay; and as those whom you call mine were, as Monsieur Lenet affirms, not paid at all, they were free. Thereupon they turned against their new leader. What was I to do? I confess that I do not know."
<br> 
<br> "But what have you to say, monsieur, as to having taken the king's part yourself?—that your neutrality was a burden to you?"
<br> 
<br> "No, madame; but my neutrality, honest as it was, aroused the suspicion of his Majesty's partisans. One fine morning I was arrested at the Golden Calf inn on the Libourne road, and taken before the queen."
<br> 
<br> "And then you came to terms with her?"
<br> 
<br> "Madame," Cauvignac replied, "a man of heart has his sensitive spots, which a keen-sighted sovereign is sure to select for attack. My heart was embittered because I had been driven out of a party which I had rushed into blindly, with all the ardor and good faith of youth. I appeared before the queen between two soldiers who were ready to kill me; I expected reproaches, insults, death; for, after all, I had served the cause of the princes in intention. But, contrary to my expectations, instead of punishing me by depriving me of liberty, by consigning me to prison, or to the gallows, that great princess said to me:—
<br> 
<br> "'My gallant but deluded gentleman, I can with a word cause your head to fall; but you have met with ingratitude over yonder,—here you shall find us grateful. In the name of Saint-Anne, my patron saint, you shall be numbered henceforth among my retainers. Messieurs,' she continued, addressing my guards, 'treat this officer with respect, for I appreciate his meritorious qualities, and I make him your chief. And as for yourself,' she added, turning again to me, 'I make you governor of Braune; this is how a queen of France avenges herself.'
<br> 
<br> "What could I reply?" pursued Cauvignac, resuming his natural tone and attitude, after mimicking, in a half-comic, half-sentimental way, the voice and gestures of Anne of Austria. "Nothing. I was disappointed in my fondest hopes; I was disappointed in the result of my action in laying my devotion unrewarded at your Highness's feet, after I had had the good fortune, as it gives me great joy to remember, to render you a slight service at Chantilly. I followed the example of Coriolanus and sought the tents of the Volscii."
<br> 
<br> This discourse, delivered in a dramatic voice, and with majestic bearing, made a profound impression upon those who heard it. Cauvignac realized that he had triumphed when he saw the princess turn pale with rage.
<br> 
<br> "In Heaven's name, monsieur," said she, "to whom are you faithful?"
<br> 
<br> "To those who appreciate the delicacy of my conduct," was Cauvignac's retort.
<br> 
<br> "Be it so. You are my prisoner."
<br> 
<br> "I have that honor, madame; but I trust that you will treat me as a gentleman. I am your prisoner, it is true, but without having borne arms against your Highness. I was on my way to my post with my baggage, when I fell in with a party of your troops, who arrested me. I did not for an instant think of concealing my rank or my opinions. I say again, therefore, that I demand to be treated as a gentleman and as an officer of high rank."
<br> 
<br> "You will be so treated, monsieur," said the princess. "You will have the city for your prison; but you must swear to make no attempt to leave the city."
<br> 
<br> "I will swear whatever your Highness chooses to demand."
<br> 
<br> "'T is well. Lenet, repeat the formula to monsieur; we will receive his oath."
<br> 
<br> Lenet dictated the terms of the oath which Cauvignac was required to take.
<br> 
<br> Cauvignac raised his hand and solemnly swore that he would not leave the city until relieved from his oath.
<br> 
<br> "You may now withdraw," said the princess; "we rely upon your honor as a gentleman and a soldier."
<br> 
<br> Cauvignac did not wait to be told twice; but as he went out he detected a gesture of the councillor which signified:—
<br> 
<br> "He has put us in the wrong, madame; this is what comes of a niggardly policy."
<br> 
<br> The fact is that Lenet, who was quick to appreciate merit of every variety, recognized Cauvignac's exceeding shrewdness, and, for the very reason that he was in no wise deceived by any of his specious arguments, admired the skill with which the prisoner had extricated himself from one of the most difficult dilemmas in which a turn-coat could be involved.
<br> 
<br> Cauvignac meanwhile went slowly downstairs deep in thought, with his chin in his hand, saying to himself:
<br> 
<br> "Now the question is how I can sell them my hundred and fifty men again for a hundred thousand livres, which is quite possible, as the upright and intelligent Ferguzon has obtained full liberty for himself and his men. I shall find an opportunity one day or another. After all, I see that I did not make such a very great blunder in allowing myself to be taken as I at first thought."
