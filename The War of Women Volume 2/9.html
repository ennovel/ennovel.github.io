In her own way the poor woman was carrying on the war in the king's interest. As soon as she saw Canolles, she gave him her hand joyfully.
<br> 
<br> "The king is coming," said she, "and in a week we shall be out of danger."
<br> 
<br> "He is always coming," returned Canolles, with a sad smile; "unfortunately, he never arrives."
<br> 
<br> "Ah! but this time my information is reliable, my dear baron, and he will surely be here within the week."
<br> 
<br> "Let him make what haste he may, Nanon, he will arrive too late for us."
<br> 
<br> "What do you say?"
<br> 
<br> "I say that instead of wearing yourself out over these maps and papers, you would do better to be thinking of means of escape."
<br> 
<br> "Of escape? Why so?"
<br> 
<br> "Because I have bad news, Nanon. A new expedition is preparing, and this time I may be forced to yield."
<br> 
<br> "Very well, my dear; didn't we agree that I should share your fate and your fortune, whatever they may be?"
<br> 
<br> "No that cannot be; I shall be too weak, if I have to fear for you. Did they not propose at Agen to burn you at the stake? Did they not try to throw you into the river? Nanon, in pity for me, do not insist upon remaining, for your presence would surely make me do some cowardly thing."
<br> 
<br> "Mon Dieu, Canolles, you frighten me."
<br> 
<br> "Nanon, I implore you to give me your word that you will do what I bid you, if we are attacked."
<br> 
<br> "Why should I make such a promise?"
<br> 
<br> "To give me the strength to do my duty. Nanon, if you do not promise to obey me blindly, I swear that I will take the first opportunity to seek my own death."
<br> 
<br> "Whatever you wish, Canolles; I swear it by our love!"
<br> 
<br> "Thank God! Dear Nanon, my mind is much more at ease now. Get together your most valuable jewels. Where is your money?"
<br> 
<br> "In a small iron-bound chest."
<br> 
<br> "Have it all ready. You must take it with you."
<br> 
<br> "Oh! Canolles, you know that the real treasure of my heart is neither gold nor jewels. Canolles, is this all a mere pretext to send me away from you?"
<br> 
<br> "Nanon, you deem me a man of honor, do you not? Very good; upon my honor, what I now do is inspired solely by my dread of the danger that threatens you."
<br> 
<br> "You seriously believe that I am in danger?"
<br> 
<br> "I believe that ?le Saint-Georges will be taken to-morrow."
<br> 
<br> "How, pray?"
<br> 
<br> "That I cannot say, but I believe it."
<br> 
<br> "And suppose I consent to fly?"
<br> 
<br> "I will do everything in my power to preserve my life, Nanon, I swear."
<br> 
<br> "Do you command, my dear, and I will obey," said Nanon, giving her hand to Canolles, regardless, in the intensity of her gaze, of two great tears which were rolling down her cheeks.
<br> 
<br> Canolles pressed her hand and left the room. Had he remained a moment longer, he would have wiped away those two pearls with his lips; but he placed his hand on the viscountess's letter, and that gave him strength to tear himself away.
<br> 
<br> It was a cruel day. The positive, definite threat, "To-morrow ?le Saint-Georges will be taken," rang incessantly in Canolles' ears. How?—by what means? What ground had the viscountess for speaking with such conviction? Was he to be attacked by water or by land? From what quarter was this invisible yet indubitable disaster to burst upon him? He was well-nigh mad.
<br> 
<br> So long as the daylight lasted, Canolles burned his eyes out in the glaring sunshine, looking everywhere for the enemy. After dark he strained his eyes trying to peer into the depths of the forest, scanning the sky-line of the plain, and the windings of the river; all to no purpose, he could see nothing.
<br> 
<br> When night had fallen altogether, he spied a light in one wing of the Chateau de Cambes; it was the first time he had detected the slightest sign of life there while he had been at ?le Saint-Georges.
<br> 
<br> "Ah!" said he, with a long-drawn sigh, "there are Nanon's saviors at their post."
<br> 
<br> What a strange, mysterious problem is that of the workings of the human heart! Canolles no longer loved Nanon, Canolles adored Madame de Cambes, and yet, at the moment of separation from her whom he no longer loved, he felt as if his heart would break; it was only when he was far away from her, or when he was about to leave her, that Canolles felt the full force of the singular sentiment with which he regarded that charming person.
<br> 
<br> Every man in the garrison was on duty upon the ramparts. Canolles grew weary of gazing, and questioning the silence of the night. Never was darkness more absolutely dumb, or apparently more solitary. Not the slightest sound disturbed the perfect calmness, which seemed like that of the desert.
<br> 
<br> Suddenly it occurred to Canolles that it might be that the enemy proposed to make their way into the fort by the underground passage he had explored. It seemed highly improbable, for in that case they would have been unlikely to give him warning; but he resolved none the less to guard the passage. He ordered a barrel of powder to be prepared with a slow-match, selected the bravest man among his sergeants, rolled the barrel down upon the last step of the subterranean staircase, lighted a torch, and placed it in the sergeant's hand. Two other men were stationed near him.
<br> 
<br> "If more than six men appear in this passage," he said to the sergeant, "call upon them to withdraw; if they refuse, set fire to the match and give the barrel a roll; as the passage slopes down, it will burst in the midst of them."
<br> 
<br> The sergeant took the torch; the two soldiers stood motionless behind him, in its reddish glare, with the barrel of powder at their feet.
<br> 
<br> Canolles ascended the stairs with his mind at rest, in that direction at least; but as he stepped into his room he saw Nanon, who had seen him come down from the ramparts and return indoors, and had followed him in quest of news. She stared in open-mouthed dismay, at this yawning orifice of which she had no knowledge.
<br> 
<br> "Oh! mon Dieu!" said she, "what is that door?"
<br> 
<br> "The door of the passage through which you are to fly, dear Nanon."
<br> 
<br> "You promised me that you wouldn't require me to leave you except in case you were attacked."
<br> 
<br> "And I renew my promise."
<br> 
<br> "Everything about the island seems to be quiet, my dear."
<br> 
<br> "Everything seems quiet within, too, does it not? And yet there are a barrel of powder, a man, and a torch within twenty feet of us. If the man should put the torch to the powder, in one second not one stone would be left upon another in the whole fort. That is how quiet everything is, Nanon."
<br> 
<br> The color fled from the young woman's cheeks.
<br> 
<br> "Oh! you make me shudder!" she cried.
<br> 
<br> "Nanon, call your women," said Canolles, "and bid them come hither with all your packages, and your footman with your money. Perhaps I am mistaken, perhaps nothing will happen to-night; but never mind, let us be ready."
<br> 
<br> "Qui vive?" cried the sergeant's voice in the underground passage.
<br> 
<br> Another voice replied, but in a friendly tone.
<br> 
<br> "Hark," said Canolles, "they have come for you."
<br> 
<br> "There is no attack as yet, dear heart; all is quiet. Let me stay with you; they will not come."
<br> 
<br> As Nanon ceased to speak, the cry of "Qui vive?" rang out thrice in the inner court-yard, and the third time it was followed by the report of a musket.
<br> 
<br> Canolles darted to the window, and threw it open.
<br> 
<br> "To arms!" cried the sentinel, "to arms!"
<br> 
<br> Canolles saw a black, moving mass in one corner; it was the enemy pouring forth in floods from a low, arched doorway opening into a cellar used as a wood-house, to which there was no doubt some secret issue.
<br> 
<br> "There they are!" cried Canolles; "hurry! there they are!"
<br> 
<br> As he spoke the sentinel's shot was answered by a score of muskets. Two or three bullets shattered the glass in the window, which Canolles hastily closed.
<br> 
<br> He turned back into the room and found Nanon on her knees. Her women and her man-servant came running in from her apartment.
<br> 
<br> "There's not an instant to lose, Nanon!" cried Canolles: "come! come!"
<br> 
<br> He took her in his arms as if she weighed no more than a feather, and plunged into the underground passage, calling to her people to follow him.
<br> 
<br> The sergeant was at his post, torch in hand; the two soldiers, with matches lighted, were ready to fire upon a group of men, among whom was our old acquaintance, Master Pompée, pale with fear, and uttering profuse protestations of friendliness.
<br> 
<br> "Ah! Monsieur de Canolles," he cried, "pray tell them that you were expecting us; what the devil! one doesn't indulge in pleasantry of this sort with one's friends."
<br> 
<br> "Pompée," said Canolles, "I place madame in your charge; one whom you know has agreed upon her honor to answer to me for her; you shall answer to me for her upon your head."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, I will answer for everything," said Pompée.
<br> 
<br> "Canolles! Canolles! I will not leave you!" cried Nanon, clinging to the young man's neck; "Canolles, you promised to go with me."
<br> 
<br> "I promised to defend Saint-Georges while one stone stands upon another, and I propose to keep my promise."
<br> 
<br> Despite Nanon's shrieks and tears and entreaties, Canolles gave her into Pompée's hands, and he, with the assistance of two or three servants of Madame de Cambes and the poor girl's own attendants, carried her off into the dark passage.
<br> 
<br> For an instant Canolles looked after the fair, white phantom, as it was borne away with arms outstretched toward him. But suddenly he remembered that he was expected elsewhere, and rushed back to the stairway, shouting to the sergeant and the two soldiers to follow him.
<br> 
<br> Vibrac was in the governor's room, pale and hatless, with his drawn sword in his hand.
<br> 
<br> "Commandant," he cried as soon as he caught sight of Canolles, "the enemy!—the enemy!"
<br> 
<br> "I know it."
<br> 
<br> "What must we do?"
<br> 
<br> "Parbleu! a pretty question!—sell our lives dearly, of course!" and Canolles darted down into the court-yard. On the way he spied a miner's axe, and took possession of it.
<br> 
<br> The court-yard was full of the invading force; sixty soldiers of the garrison stood in a group, trying to defend the door leading to the governor's apartments. In the direction of the ramparts, there was much shouting and firing, and it was evident that fighting was in progress everywhere.
<br> 
<br> "Commandant! Here's the commandant!" cried the soldiers, when they saw Canolles.
<br> 
<br> "Yes," he shouted back, "the commandant has come to die with you. Courage, my lads, courage! they have surprised us by treachery, because they couldn't whip us in a fair fight."
<br> 
<br> "All's fair in war," said the mocking voice of Ravailly, who, with his arm in a sling was urging his men on to take Canolles. "Surrender, Canolles, surrender, and you shall have good terms."
<br> 
<br> "Ah! is it you, Ravailly?" was the reply. "I thought I had paid you my debt of friendship; but you are not content. Wait a moment—"
<br> 
<br> As he spoke, Canolles darted forward five or six steps, and hurled the axe he held in his hand at Ravailly with such force that it cut through the helmet and gorget of a militia officer, who stood beside the captain of Navailles, and who fell dead.
<br> 
<br> "Damnation!" exclaimed Ravailly; "how courteously you reply to proffered courtesies! I ought, though, to be well-used to your ways. He's mad, boys! fire on him! fire!"
<br> 
<br> At the word a brisk volley came from the enemy's ranks, and five or six men about Canolles fell.
<br> 
<br> "Fire!" cried he; "fire!"
<br> 
<br> But only four or five muskets responded. Taken by surprise, just when they were least expecting it, and confused by the darkness, Canolles' troops had lost their courage.
<br> 
<br> He saw that there was no hope.
<br> 
<br> "Go in," he said to Vibrac, "go in and take your men with you; we will barricade ourselves, and we won't surrender at all events until they have carried the fort by assault."
<br> 
<br> "Fire!" shouted two new voices, those of Espagnet and La Rochefoucauld. "Remember your dead comrades, who are crying out for vengeance. Fire!"
<br> 
<br> The storm of lead came whistling again about Canolles without touching him, but decimating his little troop once more.
<br> 
<br> "Back!" cried Vibrac, "back!"
<br> 
<br> "At them! at them!" cried Ravailly; "forward, my lads, forward!"
<br> 
<br> His men obeyed and rushed forward; Canolles, with hardly more than a half a score of men, sustained the shock; he had picked up a dead soldier's gun, and used it as a club.
<br> 
<br> The soldiers entered the governor's house, Vibrac and he bringing up the rear. With their united efforts they succeeded in closing the door, despite the efforts of the assailants to prevent them, and secured it with an enormous bar of iron.
<br> 
<br> There were bars at the windows.
<br> 
<br> "Axes, crow-bars, cannon if necessary!" cried the voice of Duc de La Rochefoucauld; "we must take them all, dead or alive."
<br> 
<br> His words were followed by an appalling discharge; two or three bullets pierced the door, and one of them shattered Vibrac's thigh.
<br> 
<br> "'Faith, commandant," said he, "my account is settled; do you look now to settling yours; I am done with it all."
<br> 
<br> He lay down by the wall, unable to stand erect.
<br> 
<br> Canolles glanced about him; a dozen men were still in fighting trim, among them the sergeant he had stationed in the underground passage.
<br> 
<br> "The torch!" said Canolles; "what did you do with the torch?"
<br> 
<br> "I threw it down beside the barrel, commandant."
<br> 
<br> "Is it still burning?"
<br> 
<br> "Probably."
<br> 
<br> "Good. Send out all your men through the rear doors and windows. Obtain for them and for yourself the best terms you can; the rest is my affair."
<br> 
<br> "But, commandant—"
<br> 
<br> "Obey!"
<br> 
<br> The sergeant bent his head and bade his soldiers follow him. In a twinkling they all disappeared toward the rear of the house; they understood the purpose Canolles had in mind, and were not at all solicitous to be blown up with him.
<br> 
<br> Canolles listened for an instant. They were at work on the door with axes, but the fusillade did not abate; they were firing at random, mostly at the windows, where they thought that the besieged might be lying in ambush.
<br> 
<br> Suddenly a loud shout announced that the door had yielded, and Canolles heard the assailants rushing from room to room with cries of joy.
<br> 
<br> "Ah me!" he muttered, "five minutes hence these cries of joy will change to shrieks of despair."
<br> 
<br> He rushed into the underground passage, where he found a young man sitting on the barrel, with the torch at his feet, and his face buried in his hands.
<br> 
<br> He raised his head at the sound of footsteps and Canolles recognized Madame de Cambes.
<br> 
<br> "Ah! here you are at last!" she cried, as she rose.
<br> 
<br> "Claire!" murmured Canolles, "why have you come here?"
<br> 
<br> "To die with you, if you are determined to die."
<br> 
<br> "I am dishonored, ruined, and there is nothing for me But to die."
<br> 
<br> "You are saved and your honor is secure,—saved by me."
<br> 
<br> "Ruined by you! Do you hear them? they are coming; here they are! Claire, make your escape while you may; you have five minutes, it is more than enough."
<br> 
<br> "I will not fly, I will remain."
<br> 
<br> "But do you know why I came down here? Do you know what I propose to do?"
<br> 
<br> Madame de Cambes picked up the torch, and put it near the barrel of powder.
<br> 
<br> "I have a suspicion," said she.
<br> 
<br> "Claire!" cried Canolles in dismay. "Claire!"
<br> 
<br> "Say again that you propose to die, and we will die together."
<br> 
<br> The pale face of the viscountess indicated such resolution that Canolles realized that she was quite capable of doing what she said; and he stopped.
<br> 
<br> "Tell me what you wish," he said.
<br> 
<br> "I wish you to surrender."
<br> 
<br> "Never!"
<br> 
<br> "Time is precious," continued the viscountess; "surrender. I offer you life and honor, for I give you the excuse that you were surprised by treachery."
<br> 
<br> "Let me fly, then; I will lay my sword at the king's feet, and beseech him to give me an opportunity to have my revenge."
<br> 
<br> "You shall not fly."
<br> 
<br> "Why not?"
<br> 
<br> "Because I can live in this way no longer; because I cannot live apart from you; because I love you."
<br> 
<br> "I surrender! I surrender!" cried Canolles, throwing himself at Madame de Cambes' knees, and hurling away the torch she still held in her hand.
<br> 
<br> "Ah!" she murmured, "now I have him, and no one can take him away from me again."
<br> 
<br> There was one very peculiar thing, which is capable of explanation, however; namely, that love acted so differently upon these two women.
<br> 
<br> Madame de Cambes, shy, timid, and gentle by nature, had become resolute, bold, and strong.
<br> 
<br> Nanon, capricious and wilful, had become shy, timid, and gentle.
<br> 
<br> Herein lies the explanation of the phenomenon: Madame de Cambes felt more and more confident that she was beloved by Canolles; Nanon felt that Canolles' love for her was growing less day by day.
