In the streets which lay at a distance from that favored-quarter there was no sound save the tread of the patrol, or the terrified voice of some old woman as she closed and locked her door.
<br> 
<br> But in the direction of the Esplanade there was a dull, continuous murmur as of waves beating upon a distant shore.
<br> 
<br> Madame la Princesse had finished her correspondence, and had sent word to Monsieur le Duc de La Rochefoucauld that she would receive him.
<br> 
<br> At the princess's feet, crouching upon a rug, and studying with the keenest anxiety her face and her humor, was Claire, evidently awaiting a moment when she might speak without annoying her; but her enforced patience, her studied calmness were belied by the nervous movements of the fingers with which she was folding and crumpling a handkerchief.
<br> 
<br> "Seventy-seven signatures!" cried the princess; "it's not all pleasure you see, Claire, to play at being queen."
<br> 
<br> "Indeed it is, madame; for in taking the queen's place you assumed her most gracious prerogative, that of being merciful."
<br> 
<br> "And that of punishing, Claire," rejoined the princess proudly, "for one of the seventy-seven signatures was written at the foot of a death-warrant."
<br> 
<br> "And the seventy-eighth will be at the foot of a pardon, will it not, madame?" pleaded Claire.
<br> 
<br> "What do you say, little one?"
<br> 
<br> "I say, madame, that I think it is quite time for me to go and set my prisoner free; may I not spare him the frightful spectacle of his companion led forth to his death? Ah! madame, as you consent to pardon him, pray, let it be a full and complete pardon!"
<br> 
<br> "I' faith, yes! you are quite right, little one; but, in very truth I had forgotten my promise amid all this serious business, and you have done well to remind me of it."
<br> 
<br> "Then—" cried Claire, beaming with joy.
<br> 
<br> "Do what you choose."
<br> 
<br> "One more signature, then, madame," said Claire, with a smile which would have melted the hardest heart, a smile which no painter's brush could reproduce, because it belongs only to the woman who loves, that is to say, to life in its divinest essence.
<br> 
<br> She placed a paper upon Madame la Princesse's table, and held it while she wrote:—
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The governor of Chateau-Trompette is ordered to allow Madame la Vicomtesse de Cambes access to Monsieur le Baron de Canolles, to whom we restore his liberty without reservation or condition."
<br> 
<br> "Is that right?" the princess asked.
<br> 
<br> "Oh! yes, madame!"
<br> 
<br> "And I must sign it?"
<br> 
<br> "Most assuredly."
<br> 
<br> "Ah! little one," said Madame de Condé, with her most gracious smile, "I seem compelled to do whatever you want."
<br> 
<br> And she wrote her name.
<br> 
<br> Claire pounced upon the paper like an eagle upon its prey. She hardly took time to thank her Highness, and rushed from the room pressing the paper against her heart.
<br> 
<br> On the stairway she met Monsieur de La Rochefoucauld, who was always followed wherever he went by a number of officers and admiring citizens.
<br> 
<br> Claire greeted him with a happy little smile. Monsieur de La Rochefoucauld, surprised beyond measure, stopped for an instant upon the landing, and followed her with his eyes to the bottom of the stairs before entering Madame de Condé's apartment.
<br> 
<br> "All is ready, madame," he said, when he was in her Highness's presence.
<br> 
<br> "Where?"
<br> 
<br> "Over yonder."
<br> 
<br> The princess seemed to be trying to make out his meaning.
<br> 
<br> "On the Esplanade," said the duke.
<br> 
<br> "Ah yes! very good," rejoined the princess, affecting great calmness of manner, for she felt that he was looking at her, and so, notwithstanding her woman's nature which inclined her to shudder, she listened to the voice of her dignity as leader of a great party, which bade her show no sign of weakness. "If everything is ready, let the affair proceed."
<br> 
<br> The duke hesitated.
<br> 
<br> "Do you think it advisable that I should be present?" inquired the princess, with a tremor in her voice which she could not entirely repress, notwithstanding her self-control.
<br> 
<br> "Why, that is as you please, madame," replied the duke, who was at that moment engaged in one of his physiological studies.
<br> 
<br> "We will see, duke, we will see; you know that I have pardoned one of the condemned men."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, madame."
<br> 
<br> "And what do you say to that step?"
<br> 
<br> "I say that whatever your Highness does is well done."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, I thought it better so. It will be more befitting our dignity to show the épernonists that while we do not fear to resort to reprisals, and to treat with her Majesty as one power with another, we have confidence in the strength of our cause, and return evil for evil without excitement or exaggeration."
<br> 
<br> "It is very politic."
<br> 
<br> "Is it not, duke?" rejoined the princess, seeking to gather La Rochefoucauld's real meaning from his tone and manner.
<br> 
<br> "But," he continued, "it is still your opinion, is it not, that one of the two should expiate Richon's death? For if it remains unavenged, the impression may gain ground that your Highness sets but little store by the gallant men who devote their lives to your service."
<br> 
<br> "Oh! assuredly! and one of the two shall die, on my honor as a princess! never fear."
<br> 
<br> "May I know which of the two your Highness has deigned to pardon?"
<br> 
<br> "Monsieur de Canolles."
<br> 
<br> "Ah!"
<br> 
<br> This ah! was pronounced in a most significant tone.
<br> 
<br> "Can it be that you have any particular ground for wishing that gentleman ill, Monsieur le Duc?"
<br> 
<br> "I! Madame, was I ever known to wish anybody well or ill? I divide all men into two categories: obstacles, and supporters. The former must be overthrown, and the latter supported,—so long as they support us; that is my policy, madame, and I might almost say my whole moral code."
<br> 
<br> "What infernal scheme is he concocting, and what is he driving at?" muttered Lenet; "he acted as if he detested poor Canolles."
<br> 
<br> "Well," the duke continued, "if your Highness has no other orders to give me—"
<br> 
<br> "No, Monsieur le Duc."
<br> 
<br> "I will take leave of your Highness."
<br> 
<br> "Is it to be tonight?"
<br> 
<br> "In quarter of an hour."
<br> 
<br> Lenet made ready to follow the duke.
<br> 
<br> "Are you going to see the spectacle, Lenet?" the princess asked him.
<br> 
<br> "Oh! no, madame; I am not addicted to violent emotion, as you know; I will content myself with going half way, that is to say, as far as the prison, to witness the touching picture of poor Canolles restored to freedom by the woman he loves."
<br> 
<br> The duke made a wry face. Lenet shrugged his shoulders, and the solemn procession left the palace to go to the prison.
<br> 
<br> Madame de Cambes had traversed the distance in less than five minutes; she showed the order to the sentinel at the drawbridge, then to the doorkeeper at the prison, and asked to see the governor.
<br> 
<br> The governor scrutinized the order with the inexpressive eye characteristic of prison-governors, which never lights up at sight of a death-warrant or pardon, recognized the signature and seal of Madame de Condé, saluted the messenger, and said, turning to the door:
<br> 
<br> "Call the lieutenant."
<br> 
<br> Then he motioned to Madame de Cambes to be seated; but her excitement and impatience were too intense to allow her to be at rest, and she remained on her feet.
<br> 
<br> The governor thought it incumbent upon him to speak to her.
<br> 
<br> "You know Monsieur de Canolles?" he said in the same tone in which he would have asked what the weather was.
<br> 
<br> "Oh! yes, monsieur," was the reply.
<br> 
<br> "He is your brother, mayhap, madame?"
<br> 
<br> "No, monsieur."
<br> 
<br> "A friend?"
<br> 
<br> "He is—my fiancé," said Madame de Cambes, hoping that this confession would induce the governor to hasten the discharge of the prisoner.
<br> 
<br> "Ah!" he rejoined in the same tone, "I congratulate you, madame."
<br> 
<br> Having no further questions to ask, he relapsed into immobility and silence.
<br> 
<br> The lieutenant entered.
<br> 
<br> "Monsieur d'Orgemont," said the governor, "call the chief turnkey, and see that Monsieur de Canolles is set at liberty; here is the order for his discharge."
<br> 
<br> The lieutenant bowed and took the paper.
<br> 
<br> "Do you wish to wait here?" the governor asked.
<br> 
<br> "Am I not permitted to accompany monsieur?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, madame."
<br> 
<br> "Then I will do so; you understand,—I wish to be the first to tell him that his life is saved."
<br> 
<br> "Go then, madame, and receive the assurance of my respect."
<br> 
<br> Madame de Cambes made a hasty courtesy to the governor and followed the lieutenant. He was the same officer who had talked with Canolles and with Cauvignac, and he went about the duty assigned him with the zeal born of sympathy. In a moment he and Madame de Cambes were in the court-yard.
<br> 
<br> "The chief turnkey!" cried the lieutenant. "He will be here in an instant, madame; have no fear," he added.
<br> 
<br> The second turnkey appeared.
<br> 
<br> "Monsieur le lieutenant," said he, "the turnkey in chief cannot be found; we have sought in vain for him."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, monsieur," cried Claire; "does this mean further delay?"
<br> 
<br> "No, madame, the order is explicit; be calm."
<br> 
<br> Madame de Cambes thanked him with one of those glances which none but women and angels have to give.
<br> 
<br> "You have duplicate keys to all the cells?" asked Monsieur d'Orgemont.
<br> 
<br> "Yes, monsieur."
<br> 
<br> "Open Monsieur de Canolles' door."
<br> 
<br> "Monsieur de Canolles in number two?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, number two; open at once."
<br> 
<br> "By the way, I believe they are both together in there," said the turnkey; "you can choose the best-looking."
<br> 
<br> Jailers in all ages have been facetious. But Madame de Cambes was too happy to take offence at the heartless pleasantry. On the contrary she smiled at it, and would have embraced the man if need be to induce him to hasten so that she might be with Canolles a second earlier.
<br> 
<br> At last the door was opened. Canolles who had heard steps in the corridor, and recognized the viscountess's voice, threw himself into her arms, and she, forgetting that he was neither her husband or her lover, strained him to her heart with all her strength. The peril that had threatened him, the eternal separation to which they had come so close, purified everything.
<br> 
<br> "Well, my dear," said she, radiant with joy and pride, "you see that I have kept my word: I have obtained your pardon as I promised; I have come to fetch you, and we are going away."
<br> 
<br> Even as she spoke she was dragging him toward the corridor.
<br> 
<br> "Monsieur," said the lieutenant, "you may well devote your whole life to madame, for you certainly owe it to her."
<br> 
<br> Canolles made no reply; but his eyes gazed fondly at the saving angel, and his hand pressed the hand of the loving woman.
<br> 
<br> "Oh! do not hasten so," said the lieutenant, with a smile; "it is all over, and you are free, so take time to open your wings."
<br> 
<br> But Madame de Cambes, paying no heed to these words of good cheer, continued to drag Canolles through the corridors. Canolles let her have her will, exchanging friendly signs with the lieutenant. They reached the staircase, and descended the stairs as if they were provided with the wings of which the lieutenant had spoken. At last they stood in the court-yard; one more door, and the atmosphere of the prison would cease to oppress their long-suffering hearts.
<br> 
<br> That last door was finally thrown open. But on the other side, the drawbridge was thronged with a troop of gentlemen, archers and guards; they were Monsieur de La Rochefoucauld and his acolytes.
<br> 
<br> Without knowing why, Madame de Cambes shuddered. Some evil thing had befallen her every time that that man had come in her path.
<br> 
<br> As to Canolles, if he experienced any emotion whatever, no trace of it appeared upon his features.
<br> 
<br> The duke saluted Madame de Cambes and Canolles, and even paused to offer his congratulations. Then he made a sign to his followers, and they made way for the lovers to pass.
<br> 
<br> Suddenly a voice was heard at the far end of the court-yard, inside the prison:—
<br> 
<br> "Number one is empty; the other prisoner is not in his cell; I have searched everywhere and cannot find him!"
<br> 
<br> These words sent a thrill of excitement through all who heard them; the Duc de La Rochefoucauld started, and unable to restrain his first impulse, put out his hand as if to stop Canolles.
<br> 
<br> Claire saw the movement and every vestige of color fled from her cheeks.
<br> 
<br> "Come, come," said she, "let us make haste!"
<br> 
<br> "Pardon me, madame," said the duke, "but I must ask you to be patient for a moment. Give us time, if you please, to clear up this mistake; it will be a matter of a moment only, I promise you."
<br> 
<br> He made another sign to his followers and the passage was closed.
<br> 
<br> Canolles looked at Claire, at the duke, at the point whence the voice came, and he too turned pale.
<br> 
<br> "But why should I wait, monsieur?" demanded Claire. "Madame la Princesse de Condé signed the order for Monsieur de Canolles to be set free; here is the order, and his name is specifically mentioned; look, I beg you."
<br> 
<br> "Certainly, madame, it is as you say, and I do not assume to deny the validity of the order; it will be as effectual a moment hence as now; be patient therefore; I have sent a person to investigate who will very soon return."
<br> 
<br> "But how does that concern us?" Claire persisted. "What connection is there between Monsieur de Canolles and the prisoner in number one?"
<br> 
<br> "Monsieur le Duc," said the captain of the guards, whom the duke had sent to make inquiries, "we have searched for the other prisoner to no purpose; he cannot be found, and the chief turnkey has also disappeared; his child, whom we questioned, says that his father and the prisoner went out together by the secret door that opens on the river."
<br> 
<br> "Oho!" ejaculated the duke, "do you know anything of this, Monsieur de Canolles? An escape!"
<br> 
<br> At these words the whole truth flashed upon Canolles in an instant. He understood that it was Nanon who was watching over him; that it was he whom the jailer had come to seek; that it was he for whom the designation of Madame de Lartigues' brother was intended; that Cauvignac had unwittingly taken his place, and found freedom where he thought to find death. All these thoughts rushed into his mind at the same moment; he put his hands to his head and staggered, and only recovered himself when he saw that the viscountess was trembling and gasping for breath at his side.
<br> 
<br> Not one of these involuntary tokens of alarm escaped the duke.
<br> 
<br> "Close the doors!" he shouted. "Monsieur de Canolles, be kind enough to remain; this affair must be investigated, as you will understand."
<br> 
<br> "But, Monsieur le Duc," cried poor Claire, "you do not presume, I trust, to act in opposition to an order of Madame la Princesse!"
<br> 
<br> "No, madame," said the duke, "but I conceive it to be most important that she should be informed of what has taken place. I will not say to you, 'I will go to her myself;' you might believe it to be my purpose to influence our august mistress; but I will say, 'Do you go, madame;' for you know better than any one how to solicit Madame de Condé's clemency."
<br> 
<br> Lenet made an almost imperceptible sign to Claire.
<br> 
<br> "Oh! I will not leave him!" she cried, convulsively pressing the young man's arm.
<br> 
<br> "I will go to her Highness," said Lenet; "do you come with me, captain; or come yourself, Monsieur le Duc."
<br> 
<br> "So be it, I will go with you. Monsieur le capitaine will remain here and continue the search in our absence; perhaps the other prisoner may be found."
<br> 
<br> As if to enforce the latter portion of his sentence, La Rochefoucauld said a few words in the officer's ear, then took his departure with Lenet.
<br> 
<br> At the same time the viscountess and Canolles were forced back into the court-yard by the crowd of horsemen in attendance upon Monsieur de La Rochefoucauld, and the door clanged behind them.
<br> 
<br> During the last ten minutes the scene had taken on a character of such gravity and solemnity that all those who witnessed it stood by, pale-faced and silent, exchanging glances of deep meaning, and gazing at Canolles and Claire as if to read in their eyes which of the two was suffering the more. Canolles realized that it was for him to find courage for both; his demeanor was grave but most affectionate to his weeping companion, who clung to him, red-eyed and hardly able to stand, drew him closer to her side, smiled upon him with an expression of heart-breaking affection, and shuddered as she looked about upon that throng of men, seeking in vain one friendly face.
<br> 
<br> The captain, who had received his instructions from the duke, spoke in a low tone to his officers. Canolles, whose glance was keen, and whose ear was quick to hear the slightest hint that tended to change his suspicion to certainty, heard him, despite the care he took to speak as low as possible, utter these words:—
<br> 
<br> "We must devise some means of sending away that poor woman."
<br> 
<br> He tried thereupon to release his arm from the caressing grasp that detained it. Claire divined his purpose and clung to him with all her strength.
<br> 
<br> "You must continue your search," she cried; "perhaps they have not searched thoroughly, and the man will yet be found. Let us all search; it is not possible that he has escaped. Why should not Monsieur de Canolles have escaped with him? Come, Monsieur le Capitaine, order them to continue the search, I entreat you."
<br> 
<br> "They have searched, madame, and are searching at this moment. The jailer is well aware that his head will pay the penalty if he doesn't produce his prisoner; so that his interest alone would lead him to make a most thorough search."
<br> 
<br> "Mon Dieu!" murmured Claire, "and Monsieur Lenet does not return!"
<br> 
<br> "Patience, dear heart, patience," said Canolles, in the soothing tone in which one speaks to children; "Monsieur Lenet has but just gone; he has barely had time to reach Madame la Princesse; give him time to explain matters to her and then to return with her reply." He gently pressed her hand as he spoke; then, noticing that the captain of the guards was gazing at him intently and with evident impatience, he said to him:—
<br> 
<br> "Do you wish to speak with me, captain?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, monsieur," he replied, for the unremitting scrutiny of the viscountess kept him on the rack.
<br> 
<br> "Monsieur," she cried, "take us to Madame la Princesse, I implore you. What difference can it make to you? As well take us to her as leave us here in suspense; she will see him, monsieur, she will see me, I will speak to her, and she will renew her promise."
<br> 
<br> "That is an excellent idea of yours, madame," said the officer, seizing hastily upon the suggestion; "go to her yourself, go! you have every chance of success."
<br> 
<br> "What do you say to it, baron?" the viscountess asked. "Do you think it would be well? You would not deceive me; what ought I to do?"
<br> 
<br> "Go, madame," said Canolles, with a mighty effort.
<br> 
<br> The viscountess dropped his arm, walked away a few steps, then ran back to him.
<br> 
<br> "Oh! no! no!" said she, "I will not leave him."
<br> 
<br> At that moment the outer door opened.
<br> 
<br> "Ah! God be praised!" she cried; "here are Monsieur Lenet and Monsieur le Duc!"
<br> 
<br> Behind Monsieur de La Rochefoucauld with his sphinx-like face, came Lenet with sorrowful countenance and trembling hands. At the first glance he exchanged with the counsellor, Canolles saw that there was no hope for him, that his doom was sealed.
<br> 
<br> "What have you to tell?" demanded Claire, rushing impetuously to meet Lenet, and dragging Canolles with her.
<br> 
<br> "Madame la Princesse is much embarrassed—" stammered Lenet.
<br> 
<br> "Embarrassed!" cried Claire, "what does that mean?"
<br> 
<br> "It means that she asks for you," interposed the duke, "that she wishes to speak with you."
<br> 
<br> "Is that true, Monsieur Lenet," demanded Claire, without pausing to reflect that the question was an insult to the duke.
<br> 
<br> "Yes, madame," faltered Lenet.
<br> 
<br> "But what of him?" she asked.
<br> 
<br> "Of whom?"
<br> 
<br> "Monsieur de Canolles."
<br> 
<br> "Oh! Monsieur de Canolles will return to his cell, and you will bring back the princess's reply to him."
<br> 
<br> "Will you remain with him, Monsieur Lenet?"
<br> 
<br> "Madame—"
<br> 
<br> "Will you remain with him?" she repeated.
<br> 
<br> "I will not leave him."
<br> 
<br> "You will not leave him, you swear that you will not?"
<br> 
<br> "My God!" muttered Lenet, gazing from the man who awaited his sentence to the woman whose death one word from his mouth might cause. "My God! since one of the two is doomed, give me strength to save the other."
<br> 
<br> "You will not swear, Monsieur Lenet!"
<br> 
<br> "I swear," replied the counsellor, putting his hand to his heart.
<br> 
<br> "Thanks, monsieur," said Canolles beneath his breath, "I understand you.—Go, madame," he added, turning to the viscountess; "you see that between Monsieur Lenet and Monsieur le Duc I am in no danger."
<br> 
<br> "Do not let her go without embracing her," said Lenet.
<br> 
<br> Canolles' brow was bedewed with icy sweat; a sort of mist came before his eyes; he detained Claire, as she was about to leave him, and pretending that he had something to whisper to her, drew her to his heart, and said in her ear:—
<br> 
<br> "Entreat without servility; I wish to live for you, but you should wish me to live honored."
<br> 
<br> "I will entreat in such fashion as to save you," she replied; "are you not my husband in God's sight?"
<br> 
<br> Canolles, as he released her, found a way to touch her neck with his lips, but so cautiously that she did not feel it, and the poor creature, mad with apprehension, left him without returning his last kiss. As she was about to leave the court-yard she turned, but there was a line of guards between her and the prisoner.
<br> 
<br> "Where are you, my friend? I cannot see you; one word, one word I pray, so that I may go with your voice in my ears."
<br> 
<br> "Go, Claire," said Canolles. "I await your return."
<br> 
<br> "Go, go, madame," said a kind-hearted officer; "the sooner you go, the sooner you will return."
<br> 
<br> "Monsieur Lenet, dear Monsieur Lenet," cried Claire's voice in the distance, "I rely upon you; you will answer to me for him."
<br> 
<br> And the door closed behind her.
<br> 
<br> "Good!" muttered the philosophical duke; "that was not over pleasant; but at last we are in the realm of the possible once more."
