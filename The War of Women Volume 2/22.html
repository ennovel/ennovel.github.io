The rooms were located on the ground-floor, which in most prisons might properly be called the third floor; for prisons do not as a general rule begin at the ground like houses, but have two stories of underground dungeons.
<br> 
<br> Each door of the prison was guarded by a detachment of men selected from among the princess's guards; but the crowd, having taken note of the preparations which satisfied its thirst for vengeance, gradually melted away from the neighborhood of the prison, whither it had hurried upon learning that Canolles and Cauvignac had been taken there. Whereupon the guards who were stationed in the inner corridor, rather to protect the prisoners from the popular fury than from any fear of their escaping, left their posts, and thenceforth the ordinary sentries were simply doubled.
<br> 
<br> The people, finding that there was nothing more to be seen where they were, naturally betook themselves to the spot where executions generally took place,—the Esplanade, to wit. The words tossed down to them from the council-hall were instantly circulated throughout the city, and every one drew his own conclusions from them. But the one thing about which there could be no doubt was that there would be a spectacle of horrible interest that same night, or on the following day at latest; it was an additional fascination for them not to know precisely what to look forward to.
<br> 
<br> Artisans, tradesmen, women, and children hurried toward the ramparts, and as it was quite dark and the moon would not rise until about midnight, many carried torches in their hands. Almost all the windows were open, too, and many people had placed torches or lamps on the window-sills, as they were accustomed to do on fête-days. But the ominous muttering of the crowd, the terrified glances of the sightseers, and the frequent passage of patrols on foot and mounted, afforded sufficient evidence that it was no ordinary fête for which such lugubrious preparations were being made.
<br> 
<br> From time to time cries of rage arose from the groups, which formed and dissolved with a rapidity characteristic of the effect of a certain class of occurrences. These cries always resembled those which penetrated to the council-hall on several occasions:—
<br> 
<br> "Death to the prisoners! vengeance for Richon!"
<br> 
<br> The cries, the bright light, the tread of many horses interrupted Madame de Cambes' devotions. She went to her window and looked out in dismay at all the men and women with eyes flashing fiercely, who seemed like wild beasts let loose in the arena, roaring for the human victims they were to devour. She asked herself how it could be that all these human beings, whom the two prisoners had never injured in any way, could so savagely demand the death of two of their fellow-creatures; and she could find no reply to her question, poor woman, for of all the passions of mankind she knew only those which soften the heart.
<br> 
<br> From the window at which she stood, Madame de Cambes could see the summit of the high, frowning towers of the fortress above the roofs of the houses and the tree-tops. That was where Canolles was, and her eyes wandered most frequently to them. But she could not avoid turning them from time to time into the street, and then she would see those threatening faces and hear those blood-curdling cries of vengeance, and an icy shudder would run through her veins.
<br> 
<br> "Ah!" she said to herself, "in vain do they forbid my seeing him; I must find a way to get to him! These horrible noises may reach his ear; he may think that I have forgotten him; he may accuse me; he may curse me. Oh! every moment that passes without my trying to find a way to comfort him seems to me like treachery to him; it is impossible for me to continue inactive, when perhaps he is calling me to his rescue. Oh! I must see him. Yes, but, mon Dieu! how to get to see him?—who will take me to the prison? what power have I to order the doors opened? Madame la Princesse has refused to give me a pass, and she had just granted so much in answer to my prayers that she was quite right to refuse. There are guards, there are enemies of his around the fortress; the whole population has scented blood, and doesn't propose to be cheated of its prey; they will think that I mean to help him escape, rescue him; oh! yes: and I would rescue him if he had not already the safeguard of her Highness's word. If I tell them that I simply want to see him they won't believe me, and will turn me away; and again, do I not run the risk of losing what I have already gained if I take this step against Madame la Princesse's will? Will she not be likely to retract the promise she gave me? And yet to leave him to pass the long hours of the night in anguish and torture! Oh! I feel that it is impossible, for myself even more than for him! I will pray God for help, and perhaps he will inspire me."
<br> 
<br> Thereupon Madame de Cambes for the second time knelt before her crucifix, and began to pray with a fervor which might have touched Madame la Princesse's heart could she have heard her.
<br> 
<br> "Oh! I will not go, I will not go," said she; "for I understand that it is indeed impossible for me to go thither. All night he will perhaps accuse me of abandoning him. But to-morrow, to-morrow, my God, will set me right in his sight, will it not?"
<br> 
<br> Meanwhile the uproar, the constantly increasing excitement of the crowd, the sinister glare, which shone into her room, where there was no light, and at times illuminated it as by lightning, caused her such intense terror that she placed her hands over her ears, and pressed her closed eyes against the cushion of her prie-Dieu.
<br> 
<br> At that moment the door opened, and, unheard by her, a man entered; after pausing a moment upon the threshold, with an expression of affectionate compassion, when he saw how her whole body was shaken by her sobbing, he approached with a sigh, and laid his hand upon her arm.
<br> 
<br> Claire rose to her feet in dismay.
<br> 
<br> "Monsieur Lenet!" she exclaimed: "Monsieur Lenet: ah! you have not abandoned me?"
<br> 
<br> "No," was the reply: "I feared that you were but partly reassured, and I ventured to come to you to ask if I can be of service to you in any way."
<br> 
<br> "Oh, my dear Monsieur Lenet," cried Claire, "how good you are, and how grateful I am to you!"
<br> 
<br> "It seems that I was not mistaken," said Lenet. "One rarely is mistaken, God knows, when one fancies that one's fellow-creatures are suffering," he added with a sad smile.
<br> 
<br> "Ah! monsieur," cried Claire, "you say truly; I am indeed suffering!"
<br> 
<br> "Did you not obtain all that you desired, madame, and more, I confess, than I myself dared hope?"
<br> 
<br> "Yes, of course; but—"
<br> 
<br> "But—I understand; you are terrified, are you not, to see the fierce joy of this mob in its thirst for blood; and you are moved to pity for the fate of the other poor wretch who is to die in your lover's place?"
<br> 
<br> Claire was silent for a moment with pale cheeks and her eyes fixed upon Lenet's; then she put her hand to her sweat-bedewed brow.
<br> 
<br> "Oh! forgive me, or rather curse me!" said she; "for, selfish brute that I am, I have not even thought of him. No, Lenet, no; in all possible humility I confess that these fears, these prayers, these tears of mine are for him who is to live; for, absorbed as I am by my love, I had forgotten him who is to die!"
<br> 
<br> Lenet smiled sadly.
<br> 
<br> "Yes," said he, "that may well be, for it is human nature; it may be that the selfishness of individuals is the salvation of the masses. Every one cuts a circle about himself and his own people with a sword. Come, madame," he continued, "pursue your confession to the end. Confess frankly that you are in haste to have the poor wretch undergo his fate; for his death will ensure the safety of your fiancé!"
<br> 
<br> "Oh! I hadn't thought of that as yet, Lenet; upon my word I hadn't. But do not turn my thoughts in that direction, for I love him so dearly that I do not know what I may be capable of wishing in the intensity of my love."
<br> 
<br> "Poor child!" said Lenet, in a most compassionate tone, "why did you not say all this sooner?"
<br> 
<br> "Oh! mon Dieu! you terrify me. Is it too late? Is he not really safe?"
<br> 
<br> "He is, since Madame la Princesse has given her word; but—"
<br> 
<br> "But what?"
<br> 
<br> "Alas! can one be sure of anything in this world, and do not you yourself, who believe as I do that he is safe, weep instead of rejoicing?"
<br> 
<br> "I weep because I cannot visit him, my friend," Claire replied. "Consider, that he must hear these fearful noises, and believe that he is in imminent danger; consider, that he may accuse me of lukewarmness, of forgetfulness, of treachery! Oh Lenet, Lenet, what torture! Really, if the princess knew how I suffer, she would have pity on me."
<br> 
<br> "Very well, viscountess, you must see him."
<br> 
<br> "See him! impossible. You are well aware that I asked leave of her Highness to see him, and that her Highness refused."
<br> 
<br> "I know, and I approve her refusal with all my heart; and yet—"
<br> 
<br> "And yet you advise me to disobey!" cried Claire in surprise, gazing earnestly at Lenet, who lowered his eyes in confusion.
<br> 
<br> "I am old, dear viscountess, and suspicious just because I am old,—not in this matter, for the princess's word is sacred. She has said that only one of the prisoners shall die; but, accustomed as I have become in the course of a long life to see fortune turn against the one who seems most secure of her favor, my rule is always to seize any opportunity that presents itself. See your fiancé, viscountess; take my advice and see him."
<br> 
<br> "Oh! Lenet, you terrify me beyond words; really you do!"
<br> 
<br> "I have no such intention; moreover, would you prefer that I advise you not to see him? You would not, would you? And you would scold me even more severely, I know, if I had said the opposite of what I do say."
<br> 
<br> "Yes, yes, I admit it. But you tell me to see him; that was my one desire; I was praying when you arrived that I might be allowed to see him. But isn't it impossible?"
<br> 
<br> "Is anything impossible to the woman who took Saint-Georges?" asked Lenet, with a smile.
<br> 
<br> "Alas!" said Claire, "for two hours I have been trying to think of some way of obtaining admission to the fortress, but I cannot."
<br> 
<br> "What would you give me if I were to show you a way?"
<br> 
<br> "I would give you—I would give you my hand on the day that I go to the altar with him."
<br> 
<br> "Thanks, my child," said Lenet; "indeed, you could do nothing more acceptable to me, for I love you like a father; thanks."
<br> 
<br> "Tell me the way! Tell me the way!" said Claire.
<br> 
<br> "It is this. I asked Madame la Princesse for a pass to allow me to talk with the prisoners; for if there were any way of saving Captain Cauvignac I would be glad to enroll him in our party; but the pass is useless to me now, as you have condemned him to death with your prayers for Monsieur de Canolles."
<br> 
<br> Claire could not repress a shudder.
<br> 
<br> "So take this paper," continued Lenet; "there is no name mentioned in it, you see."
<br> 
<br> Claire took it and read:—
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The keeper of the fortress will permit the bearer of this to converse for half an hour with either of the two prisoners of war, as he may choose.
<br> 
<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "CLAIRE-CLéMENCE DE CONDé."
<br> 
<br> "You have a suit of man's clothes," said Lenet; "put it on. You have the permit; use it."
<br> 
<br> "Poor fellow!" murmured Claire, unable to banish from her mind the thought of Cauvignac to be executed in place of Canolles.
<br> 
<br> "He undergoes the common fate," said Lenet. "Being weak, he is devoured by the strong; having no protector, he pays for him who has; he is an intelligent fellow."
<br> 
<br> Claire meanwhile was turning the paper over and over in her hands.
<br> 
<br> "Do you know," said she, "that you tempt me cruelly with this permit? Do you know that if I once hold my poor friend in my arms I am quite capable of taking him with me to the ends of the world?"
<br> 
<br> "I would advise you to do it, madame, if it were possible; but this permit does not give you carte-blanche, and you can use it for no other purpose than that for which it was intended."
<br> 
<br> "True," said Claire, reading it once more; "and yet they have given me Monsieur de Canolles; he is mine; they cannot take him from me again!"
<br> 
<br> "Nor does any one think of doing so. Come, come, madame, waste no time; don your male costume, and begone. This permit gives you half an hour; I know that half an hour is very little; but after the half-hour will come your whole life. You are young, and have many years before you; God grant that they be happy years."
<br> 
<br> Claire seized Lenet's hand, drew him to her side, and kissed his forehead as she might have done to the most affectionate of fathers.
<br> 
<br> "Go, go," said Lenet, pushing her gently toward the door, "do not lose time; the man who truly loves is never resigned."
<br> 
<br> As he watched her pass into another room, where Pompée, at her bidding, was waiting to assist in her transformation,—
<br> 
<br> "Alas!" he muttered, "who knows?"
