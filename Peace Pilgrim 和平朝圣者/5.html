Mine is for peace, and that is why I am a Peace Pilgrim.
<br> My pilgrimage covers the entire peace picture: peace amongnations, peace among groups, peace within our environment, peaceamong individuals, and the very, very important inner peace—whichI talk about most often because that is where peace begins.
<br> The situation in the world around us is just a reflection of thecollective situation. In the final analysis, only as we become morepeaceful people will we be finding ourselves living in a more peacefulworld.
<br> In the Middle Ages the pilgrims went out as the disciples weresent out—without money, without food, without adequate clothing—and I know that tradition. I have no money. I do not accept anymoney on my pilgrimage. I belong to no organization. There is noorganization backing me. I own only what I wear and carry.There isnothing to tie me down. I am as free as a bird soaring in the sky.
<br> I walk until given shelter, fast until given food. I don’t ask—it’sgiven without asking. Aren’t people good! There is a spark of goodin everybody, no matter how deeply it may be buried, it is there. It’swaiting to govern your life gloriously. I call it the God-centerednature or the divine nature. Jesus called it the Kingdom of Godwithin.
<br> Now, a pilgrim walks prayerfully, and a pilgrim walks as anopportunity to come in contact with many people and perhapsinspire them to do something for peace in their own way. For thatpurpose I wear my short tunic with PEACE PILGRIM on the front and25,000 Miles On Foot for Peace on the back. It makes my contacts forme in the kindest way...and I like to be kind.
<br> You’re in a much better position to talk with people when theyapproach you than when you approach them.Those individuals whoare attracted to me are either genuinely interested in some phase ofpeace or just have a good lively curiosity. Both kinds are very worthwhilepeople. Then I have time to share with people my peacemessage which says in one sentence:
<br> This is the way of peace—overcome evil with good,and falsehood with truth, and hatred with love.
<br> The Golden Rule would do equally well. There is nothing newabout that except the practice of it. But I consider it the lesson fortoday and so it becomes the message of the peace pilgrimage. Pleasedon’t say lightly that these are just religious concepts and not practical.
<br> These are laws governing human conduct, which apply as rigidlyas the law of gravity.When we disregard these laws in any walk of life,chaos results.Through obedience to these laws this world of ours willenter a period of peace and richness of life beyond our fondest dreams.
<br> The key word for our time is practice.We have all the light weneed, we just need to put it into practice.
<br> What I walk on is not the energy of youth, it is a better energy.
<br> I walk on the endless energy of inner peace that never runs out!
<br> When you become a channel through which God works there are nomore limitations, because God does the work through you: you aremerely the instrument—and what God can do is unlimited. Whenyou are working for God you do not find yourself striving and straining.
<br> You find yourself calm, serene and unhurried.
<br> My pilgrimage is not a crusade, which connotes violence.Thereis no attempt to force something on people. A pilgrimage is a gentlejourney of prayer and example. My walking is first of all a prayer forpeace. If you give your life as a prayer you intensify the prayerbeyond all measure.
<br> In undertaking this pilgrimage I do not think of myself as an individualbut rather as an embodiment of the heart of the world whichis pleading for peace. Humanity, with fearful, faltering steps walks aknife-edge between abysmal chaos and a new renaissance, whilestrong forces push toward chaos.Yet there is hope. I see hope in thetireless work of a few devoted souls. I see hope in the real desire forpeace in the heart of humanity, even though the human family gropestoward peace blindly, not knowing the way.
<br> My pilgrimage is an opportunity to talk with my fellow humanbeings about the way of peace. It is also a penance for whatever I mayhave contributed by commission or omission to the tragic situationin the world today. It is a prayer that this war-weary world of ourswill somehow find the way to peace before a holocaust descends.
<br> My mission is to help promote peace by helping others to findinner peace. If I can find it, you can too. Peace is an idea whose timehas come.
<br> I began my pilgrimage on the first of January in 1953. It is myspiritual birthday of sorts. It was a period in which I was mergedwith the whole. No longer was I a seed buried under the ground, butI felt as a flower reaching out effortlessly toward the sun. On that dayI became a wanderer relying upon the goodness of others. It wouldbe a pilgrim’s journey undertaken in the traditional manner: on footand on faith. I left behind all claims to a name, personal history, possessionsand affiliations.
<br> It would be a glorious journey.
<br> The birthplace of the pilgrimage was at the Tournament of Rosesparade in Pasadena, California. I walked ahead along the line ofmarch, talking to people and handing out peace messages, and noticingthat the holiday spirit did not lessen the genuine interest in peace.
<br> When I had gone about half way a policeman put his hand on myshoulder and I thought he was going to tell me to get off the line ofmarch. Instead he said, “What we need is thousands like you.”
<br> What happened to me in the Los Angeles area in the beginningwas almost miraculous. All channels of communication were openedto me and my little peace message. I spent hours being interviewedby newspaper reporters and being photographed by newspaper pho-tographers.The story of the pilgrimage and even my picture went outover all the wire services. Besides doing two live television programs,I spent hours recording for radio and the television newscasts.
<br> Newspapers all along the line from Los Angeles to San Diegowere interested. In San Diego I did one television program and fourradio shows. The head of the San Diego Council of Churchesapproved of my message and my three petitions, and they werewidely circulated in the churches.
<br> When I was not on the road I was speaking and gathering signaturesfor the three peace petitions which I carried. The first was ashort plea for immediate peace in Korea. It read: “Let the killing inKorea cease! Then deal with this conflict situation according to the only principleswhich can solve it—overcome evil with good and falsehood with truthand hatred with love.”
<br> The second petition was directed to the President and congressionalleaders requesting the installation of a Peace Department.
<br> It read: “This is the way of peace, overcome evil with good and falsehood withtruth and hatred with love. We plead for the establishment of a Peace Department,with a Secretary of Peace who accepts these principles—and with allconflicts at home and abroad to be referred to this Peace Department.”
<br> The third petition was a plea to the United Nations and theworld leaders for world disarmament and reconstruction: “If youwould find the way of peace you must overcome evil with good and falsehoodwith truth and hatred with love.We plead with you to free us all from thecrushing burden of armaments, to free us from hatred and fear, so that we mayfeed our hungry ones, mend our broken cities, and experience a richness of lifewhich can only come in a world that is unarmed and fed.”
<br> I accumulated signed petitions from individuals, peace groups,churches and organizations along my pilgrimage route, storing themin a satchel which was carried for the occasion. I presented them toofficials at both the White House and the United Nations at the conclusionof my first walk across the country.And I am thankful that myfirst petition, “Let the killing in Korea cease...” was at least partiallygranted before the first year was over.
<br> At Tijuana, Mexico, just across the border from San Diego, I was received by the mayor, and he gave me a message to carry to themayor of New York City. I also carried a message from the CaliforniaIndians to the Arizona Indians.
<br> While passing through San Diego that first year I was introducedinto public speaking. A high school teacher approached me onthe street and inquired if I would speak to her class. I told her in allfairness that as Peace Pilgrim I had never spoken to a group before.
<br> She assured me that it would be fine and asked only that I wouldanswer the students’ questions. I agreed. If you have somethingworthwhile to say, you can say it. Otherwise, why in the world wouldyou want to be speaking?
<br> I have no problem speaking before a group.When you have completelysurrendered to God’s will, the way seems easy and joyous. Itis only before you have completely surrendered that the way seemsdifficult. When I speak, energy flows through me like electricityflows through a wire.
<br> In the beginning, my speaking engagements were often arrangedon the spur of the moment. As I was walking past a school, the principalcame out and said, “My students are looking at you from thewindows. If you would come in and talk to them we’ll gather themin the gymnasium.” So I did.
<br> Then at noon, a man from one of the civic clubs approached meand said, “My speaker disappointed us.Will you come and speak atour luncheon?” And of course I did.
<br> The same afternoon a college professor on the way to his classstopped me and asked, “Could I take you to my students?” So I spoketo his class.
<br> Then at night a minister and his wife going to a church supperstopped me and said, “Would you consider coming and eating withus, and speaking to us?” And I did. They also gave me a bed for thenight. And all this happened as I was walking along one day withoutany prior engagements.
<br> I now keep very busy speaking for peace at colleges, highschools, churches, and so forth—but always I am happily busy. Myslogan of first things first has enabled me to take care of my speakingengagements, keep my mail up to date and also do some walking.
<br> Once in Cincinnati I gave seven sermons at seven different placesof worship in one day. On that particular Sunday I gave local ministersthe day off!
<br> No collections are permitted at meetings that are held for me. Inever accept a penny for the work I do. Any money sent to methrough the mail is used to publish my literature which is sent free ofcharge to anyone who requests it.
<br> Truth is the pearl without price. One cannot obtain truth bybuying it—all you can do is to strive for spiritual truth and when oneis ready, it will be given freely. Nor should spiritual truth be sold, lestthe seller be injured spiritually. You lose any spiritual contact themoment you commercialize it.Those who have the truth would notbe packaging it and selling it, so anyone who is selling it, really doesnot possess it.
<br> When I first started out I thought the pilgrimage might entailsome hardships. But I was determined to live at need level, that is, Ididn’t want more than I need when so many have less than they need.
<br> Penance is the willingness to undergo hardships for the achievementof a good purpose. I was willing. But when hardships came I foundmyself lifted above them. Instead of hardship, I found a wonderfulsense of peace and joy and conviction that I was following God’s will.
<br> Blessings instead of hardships are showered upon me.
<br> I remember my first lesson on the pilgrimage was the lesson ofreceiving. I had been on the giving side for many years and I neededto learn to accept as gracefully as I had been able to give, in order togive the other fellow the joy and blessing of giving. It’s so beautifulwhen you live to give.To me it’s the only way to live, because as yougive you receive spiritual blessings.
<br> I was tested severely in the beginning of my pilgrimage. Life is aseries of tests; but if you pass your tests, you look back upon them asgood experiences. I’m glad I had these experiences.
<br> If you have a loving and positive attitude toward your fellowhuman beings, you will not fear them. ‘Perfect love casteth out all fear.’
<br> One test happened in the middle of the night in the middle of theCalifornia desert. The traffic had just about stopped, and therewasn’t a human habitation within many miles. I saw a car parked atthe side of the road.The driver called to me saying, “Come on, get inand get warm.” I said, “I don’t ride.” He said, “I’m not going anywhere,I’m just parked here.” I got in. I looked at the man. He was abig, burly man—what most people would call a rough looking individual.
<br> After we had talked a while he said, “Say, wouldn’t you like toget a few winks of sleep?” And I said, “Oh, yes, I certainly would!”
<br> And I curled up and went to sleep.When I awoke I could see the manwas very puzzled about something, and after we had talked for quitesome time he admitted that when he had asked me to get into the carhe had certainly meant me no good, adding, “When you curled up sotrustingly and went to sleep, I just couldn’t touch you!”
<br> I thanked him for the shelter and began walking away.As I lookedback I saw him gazing at the heavens, and I hoped he had found Godthat night.
<br> No one walks so safely as one who walks humbly and harmlesslywith great love and great faith. For such a person gets through to thegood in others (and there is good in everyone), and therefore cannotbe harmed. This works between individuals, it works betweengroups and it would work between nations if nations had the courageto try it.
<br> Once I was hit by a disturbed teenage boy whom I had taken fora walk. He wanted to go hiking but was afraid he might break a legand be left lying there. Everyone was afraid to go with him. He wasa great big fellow and looked like a football player, and he was knownto be violent at times. He had once beaten his mother so badly thatshe had to spend several weeks in the hospital. Everybody was afraidof him, so I offered to go with him.
<br> As we got up to the first hilltop everything was going fine.Thena thunderstorm came along. He was very terrified because the thundershowerwas very close. Suddenly he went off the beam and camefor me, hitting at me. I didn’t run away although I guess I could have—he had a heavy pack on his back. But even while he was hitting meI could only feel the deepest compassion toward him. How terribleto be so psychologically sick that you would be able to hit a defenselessold woman! I bathed his hatred with love even while he hit me.
<br> As a result the hitting stopped.
<br> He said, “You didn’t hit back! Mother always hits back.” Thedelayed reaction, because of his disturbance, had reached the good inhim. Oh, it’s there—no matter how deeply it is buried—and heexperienced remorse and complete self-condemnation.
<br> What are a few bruises on my body in comparison with thetransformation of a human life? To make a long story short he wasnever violent again. He is a useful person in this world today.
<br> On another occasion I was called upon to defend a frail eightyear old girl against a large man who was about to beat her.The girlwas terrified. It was my most difficult test. I was staying at a ranchand the family went into town.The little girl did not want to go withthem, and they asked, since I was there, would I take care of thechild? I was writing a letter by the window when I saw a car arrive.
<br> A man got out of the car.The girl saw him and ran and he followed,chasing her into a barn. I went immediately into the barn. The girlwas cowering in terror in the corner. He was coming at her slowlyand deliberately.
<br> You know the power of thought. You’re constantly creatingthrough thought. And you attract to you whatever you fear. So Iknew her danger because of her fear. (I fear nothing and expect good—so good comes!)I put my body immediately between the man and the girl. I juststood and looked at this poor, psychologically sick man with lovingcompassion. He came close. He stopped! He looked at me for quitea while. He then turned and walked away and the girl was safe.Therewas not a word spoken.
<br> Now, what was the alternative? Suppose I had been so foolish asto forget the law of love by hitting back and relying upon the junglelaw of tooth and claw? Undoubtedly I would have been beaten—perhapseven to death and possibly the little girl as well! Never underestimatethe power of God’s love—it transforms! It reaches thespark of good in the other person and the person is disarmed.
<br> When I started out on my pilgrimage, I was using walking fortwo purposes at that time. One was to contact people, and I still useit for that purpose today. But the other was as a prayer discipline.Tokeep me concentrated on my prayer for peace. And after a few yearsI discovered something. I discovered that I no longer needed theprayer discipline. I pray without ceasing now. My personal prayer is:
<br> Make me an instrument through which only truth can speak.
<br> During my pilgrimage through Arizona I was arrested by a plainclothespoliceman while mailing letters at the local post office inBenson. After a short ride in a patrol car I was booked as a vagrant.
<br> When you walk on faith you are technically guilty of vagrancy.Yes,I’ve been jailed several times for not having any money, but theyalways release me once they understand.
<br> There is a great deal of difference between a prison and a jail.Aprison is something big that maintains some kind of standards. A jailis a little affair that doesn’t maintain much of any standard. And thiswas a jail!
<br> They put me into a huge inner room surrounded by cell blocksin which they locked the women, four to a cell for the night. As Iwalked in I said to myself, “Peace Pilgrim, you have dedicated yourlife to service—behold your wonderful new field of service!”
<br> When I walked in one of the girls said, “Gee, you’re a funny one,you’re the only one that came in smiling. Most of them come incrying or cursing.”
<br> I said to them, “Suppose you had a day off at home—wouldn’tyou do something worthwhile on that day?” They said, “Yes, whatwill we do?” So I got them to sing songs that lifted the spirit. I gavethem a simple exercise which makes you feel tingly all over. Then Italked to them about the steps toward inner peace. I told them theylived in a community and what could be done in an outer communitycould also be done in their community.They were interested andasked many questions. Oh, it was a beautiful day.
<br> At the end of the day they changed matrons.The girls didn’t likethe woman who came in.They said she was a horrible person and saidnot to even speak to her. But I know there’s good in everybody and ofcourse I spoke to her. I learned this woman was supporting her childrenwith this job. She felt she had to work and didn’t always feel well andthat’s why she was a bit cross at times.There is a reason for everything.
<br> I asked the matron to visualize only the good in the inmates.AndI asked the girls to visualize only the good in the beleaguered matron.
<br> Later on I said to the matron, “I realize you have a full house hereand I can sleep comfortably on this wooden bench.” Instead she hadthem bring me a cot with clean bedclothes, and I had a warm showerwith a clean towel and all the comforts of home.
<br> In the morning I bade farewell to my friends and was escortedby a local deputy to the courthouse several blocks away. I wasn’thandcuffed nor was he even holding onto me. But he had a great biggun at his side, and so I looked at him and said, “If I were to run away,would you shoot me?” “Oh, no,” he said grinning, “I never shoot anythingI can catch!”
<br> In court that morning I pleaded not guilty and my case wasimmediately dismissed. In my personal effects which were takenovernight was a letter which had great weight in my release. It read:
<br> “The bearer of this note has identified herself as a Peace Pilgrim walking coastto coast to direct the attention of our citizens to her desire for peace in theworld.We do not know her personally as she is just passing through our state,but since undoubtedly it will be a long, hard trip for her,we wish her safe passage.”
<br> It was on official stationery and signed by the governor of thestate, Howard Pyle.
<br> When I was being released a court officer remarked, “You don’tseem to be any the worse for your day in jail.” I said, “You canimprison my body, but not the spirit.” It’s only the body they can putbehind prison bars. I never felt in prison and neither will you ever feelin prison—unless you imprison yourself.
<br> They took me to the spot where I had been picked up the daybefore. It was a beautiful experience.
<br> Every experience is what you make it and it serves a purpose. Itmight inspire you, it might educate you, or it might come to give youa chance to be of service in some way.
<br> Most of my speaking is now scheduled well in advance but I amstill offered speaking engagements in a most unexpected manner. InMinneapolis I was being interviewed by a reporter at a gathering ofcivic club members who were awaiting an address by the Minnesotagovernor. He was unable to make it so they invited me to speak in hisplace. Of course I accepted!
<br> And speaking of governors, as I stepped inside the big front doorof a State House one day, a nice friendly gentleman greeted me andshook my hand and asked if he could help me. I told him I was lookingfor the Governor’s office and he promptly took me there. “Isthere anything else I can do to help you?” he asked. “I thought I mighthave the privilege of shaking hands with the Governor,” I said. “Youhave shaken hands with the Governor,” said the nice friendly gentleman—the Governor himself.
<br> It was the first year of my pilgrimage and I was somewhere alongthe highway between El Paso and Dallas when I was picked up forvagrancy. I have never heard of the FBI investigating people forvagrancy but I was. A man in a black car stopped and showed me hisbadge. He didn’t even demand that I come with him, he just said,“Will you come with me?”
<br> I said, “Oh yes. I’ll be interested in talking with you.”
<br> I got into his car, but first I scratched a large ‘X’ on the highwaywhere I had been picked up. During the time I was counting miles,if I left the highway I would make a large ‘X’ and then return to thespot to begin my walk anew.
<br> He took me to this prison and said, “Book her for vagrancy,” andI went through the routine.They first take you in for fingerprinting.
<br> I was fascinated because I never had fingerprints taken before—orsince! He then took a chemical and, just like that, he got all the blackink off my fingers.When I was wondering how long it would take towash it off, it was off.
<br> I spoke to him just as I would speak to anybody I was with, andsomething interesting happened. Apparently he was used to beingtreated in a very uncooperative manner. When I treated him like ahuman being he gave me a lecture on fingerprinting and he showedme the charts. It was very interesting. I had really not learned thatmuch about fingerprinting before. People were waiting in line, but Ididn’t know that until I came out of the room and saw the long line.
<br> Then they took me in to be photographed and hung a numberaround my neck with a chain. When they were photographing mefrom the front and side, I remembered all those pictures of wantedpeople you see in the post office. I remembered how mad they alllooked, and I said to myself, “Let me be different.” And I smiled assweetly as I could. There’s one smiling face somewhere in rogue’sgallery!
<br> Then they took me in to be questioned. They actually sat meunder a strong light—it’s supposed to have a psychological effect onyou. But I had already been on television at that time, and I said tomyself, “Do they really think this is a strong light? They should see thelights in a television studio!” At that time TV lights were not onlybright but hot.
<br> They first asked me if I would answer any question, and I said,“Certainly, I will answer your questions. Not because you are lawenforcement officers, but because you are fellow human beings, andI answer the questions of all my fellow human beings.Whatever youare in your official capacity, you are first and foremost a humanbeing. And if we could get together as human being to human beingwe can get done much faster.”
<br> And it ended up that way!
<br> They began with the confusing technique. One would fire aquestion at me. Before I could answer the other would fire a questionat me. I had to keep saying, “If you will pardon me for a momentwhile I answer the other gentleman’s question.” Then they got downto meaningful questions such as college students ask me. How Iwarmed up to the subject!
<br> Then they referred to physical violence as being the intent tohurt.They said,“Would you under any circumstances use or sanctionthe use of physical violence?” I said, “No, this is contrary to God’slaws. I would rather have God on my side than any power on earth.”
<br> I told them the story of the disturbed teenage boy who hit me duringour walk together.
<br> Then they said, “Suppose it was necessary for you to defend aloved one?” I said, “Oh, no, I do not believe I could defend a lovedone by disobeying Divine Law.” I told them about the eight year oldgirl who had been left in my care and the experience we had with thepsychologically sick man who tried to harm her.
<br> Then they got into things very philosophical and said, “If you hadto choose between killing and being killed, which would youchoose?” I answered, “I don’t think I would need to make such achoice—not as long as my life remains in harmony with God’s will.
<br> Unless, of course, it was my calling to be a martyr. Now, that’s a veryhigh calling, it’s a very rare calling. I don’t believe it’s my calling—but the world learns to grow through its martyrs. If I had to make achoice, I would choose to be killed rather than kill.”
<br> They said, “Could you give a logical explanation for such an attitude?”
<br> Here I was, attempting to explain the attitude of the self-centerednature and the attitude of the God-centered nature so theycould understand it! I told them that in my frame of reference I wasnot the body. I was just wearing the body. I am that which activates thebody—that’s the reality. If I am killed, it destroys merely the clay garment,the body. But if I kill, it injures the reality, the soul!
<br> And they put me down as having a religious basis for my pilgrimage.
<br> But suppose I had said, “After all, you’ve heard of self-defense—why, even the law recognizes self-defense.” This might have beenconsidered legal—but not religious.
<br> There was an occasion when I felt that I was indeed battling withthe elements. It was my experience of walking through a dust stormwhich sometimes blew with such force I could scarcely stand againstit, while sometimes the dust was so thick I could not see ahead andcould only guide myself by the edge of the road. A policemanstopped alongside me, threw open his car door and yelled, “Get inhere, woman, before you get killed.” I told him I was walking a pilgrimageand did not accept rides (at that time). I also told him thatGod was my shield and there was nothing to fear.At that moment thewinds died down, the dust settled and the sun broke from the clouds.
<br> I continued to walk. But the wonderful thing was that I felt spirituallylifted above the hardship.
<br> Concealed in every new situation we face is a spiritual lesson tobe learned and a spiritual blessing for us if we learn that lesson. It isgood to be tested.We grow and learn through passing tests. I lookupon all my tests as good experiences. Before I was tested, I believedI would act in a loving or non-fearing way. After I was tested, I knew!
<br> Every test turned out to be an uplifting experience. And it is notimportant that the outcome be according to our wishes.
<br> I remember one experience when it said in the local newspaperI was going to speak at a church service. It showed my picture—front and back, wearing my lettered tunic. A man who belonged tothat church was simply horrified to discover that this creature wearinga lettered tunic was about to speak at his church. He called hispreacher about it, and he called his friends about it. Somebody toldme who he was. I felt so sorry that I had somehow offended a manthat I didn’t even know. So, I called him!
<br> “This is Peace Pilgrim calling,” I said. I could hear him gasp.Afterwardhe told me that he thought I had called to bawl him out. I said,“I have called to apologize to you because evidently I must have donesomething to offend you, since without even knowing me you havebeen apprehensive about my speaking at your church.Therefore I feelI must somehow owe you an apology and I have called to apologize!”
<br> Do you know that man was in tears before the conversation wasover? And now we’re friends—he corresponded with me afterward.
<br> Yes, the law of love works!
<br> Another man once said to me, “I’m surprised at the kind ofperson you are. After reading your very serious message on the wayof peace I expected you to be a very solemn person, but instead I findyou bubbling over with joy.” I said to him, “Who could know God andnot be joyous?”
<br> If you have a long face and a chip on your shoulder, if you are notradiant with joy and friendliness, if you are not filled to overflowingwith love and goodwill for all beings and all creatures and all creation,one thing is certain: you do not know God!
<br> Also, life is like a mirror. Smile at it and it smiles back at you. Ijust put a big smile on my face and everyone smiles back.
<br> If you love people enough, they will respond lovingly. If I offendpeople, I blame myself, for I know that if my conduct had been correct,they would not have been offended even though they did notagree with me. Before the tongue can speak, it must have lost the power towound.
<br> Let me tell you a time when my love had to be non-verbal. I wastrying to help a lady who had been so seriously ill that she could nolonger drive her car. She wanted to get to her older sister’s house fora few weeks of bed rest so I offered to drive her there. I still had mydriver’s license at the time. On the way she said, “Peace, I wish youcould stay with me for awhile—my older sister is so domineering. Ijust dread being alone with her.” I said, “All right, I have a few extradays. I’ll stay with you for a little while.”
<br> When we were turning into her sister’s yard she said, “Peace, Ireally don’t know how my older sister is going to accept you.”
<br> She was quite right about her older sister. When her sister tookone look at me with my lettered tunic she ordered me out of thehouse. But it was late at night and she was so afraid of the dark thatshe said, “Not tonight, you may sleep on the sofa tonight, but the firstthing in the morning you must leave!”
<br> Then she hurried her younger sister off to bed way upstairssomewhere.Well, this was worse than I thought it might be. I certainlydidn’t want to leave my friend in this situation but what couldI do? So I looked around to see if there was anything that mightpermit me to communicate with the older sister. I looked into thekitchen and there was a mountain of dirty dishes and no dishwasher,so I washed all the dishes.Then I cleaned up the kitchen and lay downand slept for a few hours.
<br> In the morning the older sister was in tears and she asked me tostay. She said, “Of course, you understand I was so tired last night Ididn’t know what I was saying.” And we had a wonderful timetogether before I left them.You see, it just gave me the chance to putmy little message into practice. Practice is good; practice makes perfect,they say.
<br> During my travels a saloon-keeper called me into his tavern togive me some food, and while I was eating he asked, “How do youfeel in a place like this?”
<br> “I know that all human beings are God’s children,” I replied.
<br> “Even when they are not acting that way, I have faith that they could,and I love them for what they could be.”
<br> As I rose to leave I noticed a man with a drink in his hand wasalso on his feet. When he caught my eye he smiled a little, and Ismiled at him. “You smiled at me,” he said in surprise. “I should thinkyou wouldn’t even speak to me but you smiled at me.” I smiled again.
<br> “I’m not here to judge my fellow human beings,” I told him. “I am here to love and serve.” Suddenly he was kneeling at my feet andsaying, “Everyone else judged me, so I defended myself.You didn’tjudge me, so now I judge myself. I’m a no-good worthless sinner!
<br> I’ve been squandering my money on liquor. I’ve been mistreating myfamily. I’ve been going from bad to worse!” I put my hand on hisshoulder. “You are God’s child,” I said, “and you could act that way.”
<br> He looked with disgust at the drink in his hand, and then hurledit against the bar, shattering the glass. His eyes met mine. “I swear toyou I’ll never touch that stuff again,” he exclaimed. “Never!” Andthere was a new light in his eyes as he walked through the door withsteady steps.
<br> I even know the happy ending to that story. About a year and ahalf later I heard from a woman in that town. She said as far as anyoneknew the man kept his promise. He never touched liquor again. Henow has a good job. He is getting along well with his family and hasjoined a church.
<br> When you approach others in judgment they will be on thedefensive. When you are able to approach them in a kindly, lovingmanner without judgment they will tend to judge themselves and betransformed.
<br> On my pilgrimage a lot of cars stopped and people invited meto ride. Some thought walking meant hitchhiking. I told them Idid not cheat God—you don’t cheat about counting miles on apilgrimage.
<br> I remember one day as I walked along the highway a very nicecar stopped and the man inside said to me, “How wonderful that youare following your calling!” I replied, “I certainly think that everyoneshould be doing what he or she feels is the right thing to do.”
<br> He then began telling me what he felt motivated toward, and itwas a good thing that needed doing. I got quite enthusiastic about itand took it for granted that he was doing it. I said, “That’s wonderful!
<br> How are you getting along with it?” And he answered, “Oh, I’mnot doing it.That kind of work doesn’t pay anything.”
<br> I shall never forget how desperately unhappy that man was. Inthis materialistic age we have such a false criteria by which to measuresuccess.We measure it in terms of dollars, in terms of materialthings. But happiness and inner peace do not lie in that direction. Ifyou know but do not do, you are a very unhappy person indeed.
<br> I had another roadside experience when a fine car stopped witha well-dressed couple inside who began to talk to me. I started toexplain to them what I was doing. Suddenly, to my amazement, theman burst into tears. He said, “I have done nothing for peace and youhave to do so much!”
<br> And then there was the time when another man stopped his carto talk with me. He looked at me, not unkindly, but with extremesurprise and curiosity, as though he had just glimpsed a live dinosaur.
<br> “In this day and age,” he exclaimed, “with all the wonderful opportunitiesthe world has to offer, what under the sun made you get outand walk a pilgrimage for peace?”
<br> “In this day and age,” I answered, “when humanity totters on thebrink of a nuclear war of annihilation, it is not surprising that one lifeis dedicated to the cause of peace—but rather it is surprising thatmany lives are not similarly dedicated.”
<br> When I ended my first cross-country walk I felt so thankful thatI had not failed to do what I had been called to do. I either said orthought to myself, “Isn’t it wonderful that God can do somethingthrough me!”
<br> Afterward I slept at the Grand Central Station railroad terminalin New York City.
<br> When I came into the state between sleep and wakefulness, I hadan impression that an indescribably beautiful voice was speakingwords of encouragement: “You are my beloved daughter in whom I am wellpleased.” When I came into full wakefulness it seemed as though acelestial orchestra had just finished playing in the station, with itsechoes still lingering on. I walked out into the cold morning, but Ifelt warm. I walked along the cement sidewalk, but I felt I was walkingon clouds. The feeling of living in harmony with divine purposehas never left me.
