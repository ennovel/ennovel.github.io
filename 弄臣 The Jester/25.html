A son...</p> 
<p>For three years Sophie and I had tried to conceive, to no result. We had wanted a child more than anything. We even spoke of it that last night we were together.I had left her , and never even knew I had a son.</p> 
<p>I turned toward Matthew, a flicker of hope alive in my heart.</p> 
<p>He isdead , Hugh. He wasn't even a year old. The bastards killed him that same night. They tore him from Sophie's arms as she tried to flee.</p> 
<p>A wall of tears rushed at my eyes. A son... A son I would never know or hold. I had been through the fiercest battles, the worst of all horrors. But nothing could have prepared me for this.</p> 
<p>How? I muttered. How did my son die?</p> 
<p>I can't even say it. Matthew's face was ashen. Just believe me when I say that he is dead.</p> 
<p>I repeated my question, this time fixed upon his eyes.How ?</p> 
<p>His voice was so quiet. As they threw Sophie's lifeless body over his mount, the leader said, We have no room for such a toy. Toss him in the flames.'</p> 
<p>I felt a pressure building up, an anger clawing at me as if my insides were ripping through my skin. God had smiled on us after all that time. He had blessed us with a son. Now He spat at me with the sharpest mockery.</p> 
<p>How could I have left them? How could I still be alive if they were dead?</p> 
<p>I looked at Matthew and asked, What was his name?</p> 
<p>Matthew swallowed. She named him Phillipe.</p> 
<p>I felt a lump catch in my throat. Phillipe was the name of the goliard who had raised me. It was her tribute to me.Sweet Sophie ,you are gone. My son too... I felt the urge to die right there amid the charred ash, the ruins of my old life.</p> 
<p>Hugh, Matthew said, lifting me up, you have to come. He led me up the trail to a knoll where I had just stood over the town. A small slate stone marked my son's grave.</p> 
<p>I sat down under a shroud of tall poplars. Phillipe De Luc, son of Hugh and Sophie, was scratched into the stone. Year of our Lord MXCVIII.</p> 
<p>I laid my head on the earth and wept. For my sweet Phillipe, whom I would never see, not even once in my life. For my wife, who was surely dead.</p> 
<p>Was this why I was spared? Was this why the Turk had not swung his murderous sword? So I would live to see all that I loved lost? Was this why the laughter had saved me? So God could laugh at me now?</p> 
<p>I took off the pouch that contained the things I had brought back for Sophie: a perfume box, some ancient coins, the scabbard, the golden cross-and I dug a hole next to my baby's grave. I gently placed my treasures in it. They were worthless to me now. They belong to you, I whispered to Phillipe. My sweet baby.</p> 
<p>I smoothed out the earth and once more laid my head on the ground.I'm so sorry, Phillipe and Sophie. Slowly my grief began to harden into rage. I knew Baldwin had ordered this. And Norcross had carried it out. But why? Why?</p> 
<p>I'm just an innkeeper, I thought. I am nothing. Just a serf.</p> 
<p>But a serf who will see you dead.</p>
