Norcross's sword jangled as he made his way to the frightened miller. On my word, miller. Norcross smiled. Only last week did you not have two sons?</p> 
<p>My son Matt has gone to Vaucluse, Georges said, and looked toward me. To study the metal trade.</p> 
<p>Themetal trade... Norcross nodded, bunching his lips. He smiled as if to say,I know that is a pile of shit. Georges was my friend. My heart went out to him. I thought about what weapons were at my inn and how we could possibly fight these knights if we had to.</p> 
<p>And with your stronger son gone, Norcross pressed on, how will you continue to pay your tax to the duke, your labor now depleted by a third?</p> 
<p>Georges's eyes darted about. It will be made easily, my lord. I will work that much harder.</p> 
<p>That is good. Norcross nodded, stepping over to the boy. In that case, you won't be missing this one too much, will you? In a flash, he hoisted the nine-year-old lad up like a sack of hay.</p> 
<p>He carried Alo, kicking and screaming, toward the mill.</p> 
<p>As Norcross passed the miller's cowering daughter, he winked at his men. Feel free to help yourselves to some of the miller's lovely grain. They grinned and dragged poor Aim俥, screaming wildly, inside the mill.</p> 
<p>Disaster loomed in front of my eyes. Norcross took a hemp rope and, with the help of a cohort, lashed Alo to the staves of the mill's large wheel, which dipped deep beneath the surface of the river.</p> 
<p>Georges threw himself at the chatelain's feet. Haven't I always been true to our lord, Baldwin? Haven't I done what was expected?</p> 
<p>Feel free to take your appeal to His Holiness. Norcross laughed, lashing the boy's wrists and ankles tightly to the water wheel.</p> 
<p>Father,father... the terrified Alo cried.</p> 
<p>Norcross began to turn the wheel. To Georges and Marie's frantic shrieks, Alo went under. Norcross held it for a moment, then slowly raised the wheel. The child appeared, wildly gasping for air.</p> 
<p>The despicable knight laughed at our priest. What do you say, Father? Is this what you expect from the Pope's protection? He lowered the wheel again and the small boy disappeared. Our entire town gasped in horror.</p> 
<p>I counted to thirty. Please, Marie begged on her knees. He's just a boy.</p> 
<p>Norcross finally began to raise the wheel. Alo was gagging and coughing water out of his lungs. From behind the mill's door came the sickening cries of Aim俥. I could scarcely breathe myself. I had to do something-even if it sealed my own fate.</p> 
<p>Sir. I stepped forward, toward Norcross.I will help the miller increase his tax by a third.</p> 
<p>And who areyou , carrot-top? The glowering knight turned, fixed on my shock of bright red hair.</p> 
<p>Carrots too, if my lord wants. I took another step. I was prepared to say anything, whatever gibberish might divert him. We'll throw in two bushels of carrots!</p> 
<p>I was about to go on-a joke, nonsense, anything that came into my head-when one of the henchmen rushed up to me. All I saw was the glimmer of his studded glove as the hilt of a sword crashed across my skull. In the next breath I was on the ground.</p> 
<p>Hugh,Hugh , I heard Sophie scream.</p> 
<p>Carrot-top here must be keen on the miller, Norcross jeered. Or the miller's wife. By a third more, you say. Well, in my lord's name, I accept your offer. Consider your tax raised.</p> 
<p>At the same time, he lowered the wheel again. I heard a struggling, choking Alo go under one more time.</p> 
<p>Norcross shouted, If it's a fight you want, then fight for the glory of your liege when called upon. If it's riches, then attend harder to your work. But the laws of custom are the laws. You all understand the laws, do you not?</p> 
<p>Norcross leaned against the wheel for the longest time. An anguished plea rose from the crowd,Please...let the boy up. Let him up. I clenched my fist, counting the beats that Alo remained under.Twenty...thirty... forty.</p> 
<p>Then Norcross's face split into an amused smile. Goodness... do I forget the time?</p> 
<p>He slowly raised the wheel. When Alo broke the surface, the boy's face was bloated and wide-eyed. His small jaw hung open, lifeless.</p> 
<p>Marie screamed and Georges began to sob.</p> 
<p>What a shame. Norcross sighed, leaving the wheel aloft and Alo's lifeless body suspended high. It seems he wasn't cut out for the miller's life after all.</p> 
<p>A silence ensued, a terrible moment that was empty and gnawing. It was broken only by Aim俥's whimpers as she emerged weak-kneed from the mill.</p> 
<p>Let us go. Norcross gathered his knights. I think the duke's point is adequately driven home.</p> 
<p>As he made his way back across the square, he stopped over me where I still lay and hovered. Then he pressed his heavy boot into my neck. Do not forget your pledge, carrot-top. I will be looking especially foryourtax payment.</p>
