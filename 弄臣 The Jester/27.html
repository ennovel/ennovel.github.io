Toward my liege's castle at Treille.</p> 
<p>Grief tore at me like wild dogs. My son had died because of me. Because of my stupid folly. Because of my foolishness and pride.</p> 
<p>As I ran, a swell of bitterness surged inside. The thought of that bastard Norcross, or any of his henchmen, having my poor Sophie...</p> 
<p>I had fought for these so-called nobles in the Holy Land while they raped and slaughtered in the name of God. I had marched and killed and followed the Pope's call. And this was my wage. Not freedom, not a changed life, but misery and scorn. I had been a fool to trust the rich.</p> 
<p>I ran until my legs gave out. Then, exhausted and blind with rage, I fell to the ground, covering my sores in dirt.</p> 
<p>I had to find Sophie. I know you are alive. I'll make you well. I know how you've suffered.</p> 
<p>At every turn, I prayed I would not stumble over her body. Every time I didn't, it gave me hope that she was alive.</p> 
<p>After a day of traveling, I looked around and didn't know where I was. I had no food and had run out of water. All that pushed me on was rage. I checked the sun. Was I heading east or north? I had no idea.</p> 
<p>But still I ran. My legs were like heavy irons. I was dizzy and my stomach ached for food. My eyes were glazed over with tears. Yet I ran.</p> 
<p>Passersby on the road looked at me as if I were mad. A madman with his staff.Treille... I begged them.</p> 
<p>They scurried to get out of the way. Pilgrims, merchants, even outlaws let me pass for the fury in my eyes.</p> 
<p>I knew not if it was one day or two. I ran until my legs gave out again. As I came to my senses, darkness clung to me. The night was cold, and I was shivering. Ominous sounds hooted from the brush.</p> 
<p>From deep in the woods, I heard the rushing water of a stream. I clawed my way off the road and into the woods, following the sound.</p> 
<p>Suddenly I lost my footing. I grasped for a bush, but my hand slipped. I started to tumble. I clawed for anything to hold, a vine, a branch. The ground disappeared beneath me.</p> 
<p>Jesus... I was falling.</p> 
<p>Let it come. I deserve it. I will die out here in the night.</p> 
<p>I called to Sophie as I hurtled out of control down the ravine.</p> 
<p>My head smacked against something hard. I felt a warm and viscous fluid fill my mouth. I'm coming, I said one more time.</p> 
<p>To Sophie.</p> 
<p>To the howling darkness...</p> 
<p>Then the world went black on me, and that was much better, thank you, Lord.</p>
