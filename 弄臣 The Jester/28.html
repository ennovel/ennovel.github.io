<p>I opened my eyes. It was still night. I had fallen into a deep ravine, far below the level of the road. My back was twisted against a tree and I could barely move. A wound ached horribly on the side of my head.</p> 
<p>Again, I heard the deep rumbling from the woods.</p> 
<p>Who's there? I called. Who is it?</p> 
<p>There was no reply. I focused on the spot in the darkness, trying to make out any shape. Who would be out here in the night? Not anyone I wanted to meet.</p> 
<p>Then, I focused on a set of eyes. Eyes not human at all, but large as prayer stones: yellow, narrow, fuming. My blood froze.</p> 
<p>Then it moved! I heard the brush crunch under its feet. The thing took a step out of the forest and came clear.</p> 
<p>Dark, hairy...</p> 
<p>Blessed Jesus Christ!It was a boar! Not twenty paces away.</p> 
<p>Its yellow eyes were trained on me, inspecting me as if I were its next meal. I heard a snort. Then it was deathly still.</p> 
<p>The thing was about to charge! I was certain of it.</p> 
<p>I tried to clear my head. I could not possibly fight such a beast.Withwhat? Its breadth alone was twice mine. It could slash me to pieces with its razory tusks.</p> 
<p>My heart was pounding, the only sound I heard other than the beast's low growl. It took another step toward me. The boar's murderous eyes never left my own, deliberate and tracking.</p> 
<p>God help me ,what could I do? I couldn't flee. It would run me down in my first steps. There was no one to shout to for help.</p> 
<p>I searched for a strong tree to climb, but I didn't want to move, to set it off. The beast seemed to study me, bucking its head, snorting its deadly intent. I could smell its fierce, hot breaths, the blood from past conflicts matted in its hair.</p> 
<p>I grabbed the knife at my belt. I didn't know if it would snap against the beast's hide.</p> 
<p>The boar snorted twice and flashed its teeth at me, its jowls red and dripping. I did not want to die. Not like this...Please ,God , do not make me fight this thing.</p> 
<p>I felt so incredibly alone.</p> 
<p>Then, with a last deep snort, the beast seemed to understand that-and it charged.</p> 
<p>All I could do was leap behind a tree, barely escaping the first violent gnash of its fearsome teeth.</p> 
<p>I stabbed wildly at it with my knife, tearing at its face and neck, doing everything I could to repel its snarling jaws. The beast lunged viciously. It came again and again. I clawed with my knife, backing around the tree. The boar's jaws ripped into my thigh and I cried out. The air emptied from my lungs.</p> 
<p>Good Lord,I was pierced.</p> 
<p>I had no time to inspect the wound. The beast slammed into me again, this time goring my abdomen. I screamed in pain.</p> 
<p>I kicked at it and slashed my blade. It backed and lunged. Its teeth clamped on my thigh and it shook its head as if to tear my leg out of its socket.</p> 
<p>I kicked myself away from the boar. I tried to run, but my legs had no strength. Blood was spattered everywhere.</p> 
<p>Somehow I limped across the clearing, my strength nearly sapped. My abdomen felt as if it were on fire. I was done here. I fell to my side and backed myself against another tree, waiting for the end to come.</p> 
<p>Beside the tree, I saw my staff. It must have toppled there in my fall. I reached for it, though it wasn't much of a weapon.</p> 
<p>I stared at the angry, snorting boar. Come at me, offal.Come at me! Finish what you started.</p> 
<p>My mind flashed to the Turk who had spared me, a world away. This time, no laughter would save the day. I held the staff like a spear.Come at me , I shouted at the boar again. Do me in. I am ready.Do me in.</p> 
<p>As if to oblige, the beast made another charge.</p> 
<p>My breath was still. I offered no defense except to raise the staff at the shape flying toward me. Harnessing all my remaining strength, I thrust the rod with all my might at its eyes.</p> 
<p>The beast let out a blood-chilling cry. I'd actually hurt it. The staff stuck in one eye. The boar staggered and shook its head madly, trying to rid itself of the staff.</p> 
<p>I grabbed my knife and with whatever strength I had, stabbed at its throat and face, at anything I could strike.</p> 
<p>Blood seeped out of its fur, each knife thrust striking home. Its growls diminished. It stumbled, still swinging its head to free the rod, while I continued to slash, tearing at its coat.</p> 
<p>The beast's blood mixed with my own. Finally its hind legs crumpled. I took the staff and forced it deep into the boar's skull. A dying snarl came out of its awful tooth-filled mouth.</p> 
<p>With a crash, the monster fell on its side. I just knelt there, depleted of strength. And amazed. I let out an exhausted shout.</p> 
<p>I had won!</p> 
<p>But I was badly wounded. Blood ran freely from my stomach and thigh. I had to make it out of the ravine or I knew I would die here.</p> 
<p>Sophie's face appeared in my mind. I know I smiled; I reached out to touch her.Here is the way , she whispered.Come to me now.</p>
