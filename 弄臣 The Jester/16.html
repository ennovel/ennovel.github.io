<p>Assault upon assault.</p> 
<p>Death after meaningless death.</p> 
<p>The siege took months. For a while, it seemed as if our glorious Crusade would end in Antioch, not Jerusalem.</p> 
<p>Our catapults flung giant missiles of fiery rock, yet they barely dented the massive walls. Wave after wave of frontal attacks only increased the death toll.</p> 
<p>Finally, we constructed enormous siege engines, as tall as the highest towers. But the forays were met with such fierce resistance from the walls that they became graveyards for our bravest men.</p> 
<p>The longer Antioch survived, the lower our spirits fell. Food was down to nothing. All the cattle and oxen had been butchered; even the dogs had been eaten. Water was as scarce as wine.</p> 
<p>All the time, rumors reached us of Christians inside the city being tortured and raped. And holy relics desecrated.</p> 
<p>Every couple of days, a Moslem warrior would hurl some urn down from the towers and it would shatter on the ground, spilling blood. That is the blood of your useless Savior, he would taunt. See how it saves you now. Or, lighting a cloth afire and tossing it to the earth, This is the shroud of the whore who gave him life.</p> 
<p>At intervals, Turk warriors made forays outside the city walls. They charged our ranks as if on a holy mission, yelping and hacking at those who met them, only to be surrounded and chopped to bits. They were unafraid, even heroic. It made us realize even more that they would not easily give in.</p> 
<p>Those we captured were sometimes handed over to a fearsome group of Frank warriors called Tafurs. Barefoot, covered in filth and sores, the Tafurs were distinguished by the ragged sackcloth they wore as uniforms and by the ferocious savagery with which they fought. Everyone was afraid of them. Even us.</p> 
<p>In battle, these Tafurs fought like possessed devils, wielding leaded clubs and axes, gnashing their teeth as if they wanted to devour the enemy alive. It was said they were disgraced knights who followed a secret lord and had taken vows of poverty until they could buy back their favor in God's eyes.</p> 
<p>Infidels unlucky enough not to be killed on the field of battle were handed to them like scraps to a dog. I watched with disgust as these swine would disembowel a Moslem warrior in front of his own eyes, stuffing his entrails into his mouth as he died. This happened, and much worse, so help me.</p> 
<p>These Tafurs reported to no lord among us, and to most of us, it seemed, no god either. They were marked by a cross burned into their necks, which attested not so much to their religious fervor as to their urge to inflict pain.</p> 
<p>The longer the horrible siege went on, the farther away I felt from anything I knew. It was now eighteen months I'd been gone. I dreamed about Sophie every night, and often during the day: that last image of her, watching me go off, her brave smile as I hopped down the road.</p> 
<p>Would she even know me now, bearded, thin as a pole, and blackened with grime and enemy blood? Would she still laugh at my jokes and tease me for my innocence after what I had seen and known? If I brought her a sunflower, would she kiss my bright red hair now that it was filled with gore and lice?</p> 
<p>My queen... How far away she seemed right now.</p> 
<p>A maiden met a wandering man, I sang in the quietest voice before I slept each night,in the light of the moon's pure cheer.</p>
