I rose early, even before the sun. The town had bid me godspeed with a festive roast the night before. All the toasts had been made and farewells said.</p> 
<p>All but one.</p> 
<p>In the doorway of the inn, Sophie handed me my pouch. In it was a change of clothes, bread to eat, a hazel twig to clean my teeth. It may be cold, she said. You have to cross the mountains. Let me get your skin.</p> 
<p>I stopped her. Sophie, it's summer. I'll need it more when I come back.</p> 
<p>Then I should pack some more food for you.</p> 
<p>I'll find food. I pumped out my chest. People will be eager to feed a Crusader.</p> 
<p>She stopped and smiled at my plain flax tunic and calfskin vest. You don't look like much of a Crusader.</p> 
<p>I stood before her, ready to leave, and smiled too.</p> 
<p>There's one more thing, Sophie said with a start. She hurried to the table by the hearth. She came back a moment later with her treasured comb, a thin band of beech wood painted with flowers. It had belonged to her mother. Other than the inn, I knew she valued it more than anything in her life. Take this with you, Hugh.</p> 
<p>Thanks, I tried to joke, but where I'm headed a woman's comb may be looked at strangely.</p> 
<p>Where you're headed, my love, you will need it all the more.</p> 
<p>To my surprise, she snapped her prized comb in two. She handed half to me. Then she held her half out and we touched the jagged edges together, neatly fitting it back into a whole.</p> 
<p>I never thought I would ever say good-bye to you, she whispered, doing her best not to cry. I thought we would live out our lives together.</p> 
<p>We will, I said.See ? One more time, we fitted the comb's halves together and made a whole.</p> 
<p>I drew Sophie close and kissed her. I felt her thin body tremble in my arms. I knew she was trying to be brave. There was nothing more to say.</p> 
<p>So... I took a breath and smiled.</p> 
<p>We looked at each other for a long while, then I remembered my own gift. From my vest pocket I took out a small sunflower. I had gone into the hills to pick it early that morning. I'll be back, Sophie, to pick sunflowers for you.</p> 
<p>She took it. Her bright blue eyes were moist with tears.</p> 
<p>I threw my pouch over my shoulder and tried to drink in the last sight of her beautiful, glistening eyes. I love you, Sophie.</p> 
<p>I love you too, Hugh. I can't wait for my next sunflower.</p> 
<p>I started toward the road. West, to Toulouse. At the stone bridge on the edge of town, I turned and took a long last look at the inn. It had been my home for the past three years. The happiest days of my life.</p> 
<p>I gave a last wave to Sophie. She stood there, holding the sunflower, and reached out the jagged edge of her comb one last time.</p> 
<p>Then I did a little hop, like a jig, to break the mood, and started to walk, spinning around a final time to catch her laugh.</p> 
<p>Her golden hair down to her waist. That brave smile. Her tinkling little-girl laugh.</p> 
<p>It was the image I carried for the next two years.</p>
