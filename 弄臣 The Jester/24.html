<p>Children stared at me, then ran toward their houses. It is Hugh. Hugh De Luc. He's back from the war, they shouted.</p> 
<p>All that could have seemed familiar about me was my mane of red hair. People rushed up to me, neighbors I recognized, whom I had not set eyes upon in two years, their faces caught between shock and joy. Hugh, praise God, it is you.</p> 
<p>But I pushed past, barely acknowledging them. I was drawn on a direct path to our inn.</p> 
<p>Our home... My heart sank as I came to the spot.</p> 
<p>A burned-out hole was left where our inn had once been.</p> 
<p>Among the cinders stood a single charred support post that had once held up a two-story structure, built by the hands of my wife's father.</p> 
<p>Our inn had been burned to the ground.</p> 
<p>Where is Sophie? I muttered, first to the charred ruins of the inn, then to faces in the gathered crowd.</p> 
<p>I went from person to person, sure that any moment I would spot her coming back from the well. But everyone stood silently.</p> 
<p>My heart began to beat insanely.Where is Sophie ? I shouted. Where is my wife?</p> 
<p>Sophie's older brother, Matthew, finally pushed out of the crowd. When he saw me, his expression shifted-from surprise to a look of deep concern. He stepped forward, hurling his arms around me. Hugh, I can't believe it. Thank God you've come back.</p> 
<p>I knew the worst had happened. I searched his eyes. What's happened, Matthew? Tell me, where is my wife?</p> 
<p>A look of deep sorrow came onto his face.Oh ,God...I almost did not want him to tell me the rest. He led me by the arm to the remains of our home. There were riders, Hugh. Ten, twelve... They swept in, in the dead of night, like devils, burning everything they could. Black crosses on their chests. They wore no colors. We had no hint of who they were. Just the crosses.</p> 
<p>Riders... ? My blood was frozen with dread. What riders, Matthew? What did they do to Sophie?</p> 
<p>He placed a hand gently upon my shoulder. They burned three dwellings in their path. Paul the carter, Sam, old Gilles, their wives and children, killed as they fled. Then they came to the inn. I tried to stop them, Hugh, I did, he cried.</p> 
<p>I seized him by the shoulders.And Sophie ? I knew the worst had happened.No, this could not be. Not now...</p> 
<p>She's gone, Hugh. Matthew shook his head.</p> 
<p>Gone?</p> 
<p>She tried to run, but the men took her inside. They beat her, Hugh.... He pursed his lips and bowed his head. They did worse. I heard her screams. They held me as they beat and raped her. Knights tore up the place, ripping it post by post. Then they dragged her out. She was like a lifeless thing, barely alive. I was sure they would leave her to die, but the leader threw her over his horse while the others released their torches. It was then that...</p> 
<p>I could barely hear him. A distant voice was echoing,No, this cannot be! My eyes welled up with tears. It was then thatwhat , Matthew?</p> 
<p>He bowed his head. They dragged her away, Hugh. I know she is dead.</p> 
<p>All strength drained from my legs. I sank to my knees.Oh, God ,how could this-have happened? How could I have left her to this fate? My Sophie gone.... I gazed upon the charred ruins of my former life.</p> 
<p>Norcross did this, didn't he?Baldwin... ?</p> 
<p>We do not know for certain. Matthew shook his head. If I did, I would go after them myself. They were beasts, but faceless ones. They wore no crests. Their visors were down. Everyone ran to the woods for cover. Yours was the only house they entered. It was as if they came for you.</p> 
<p>For me...Those bastards. I had fought two years for Baldwin's own liege. I had marched across half the world and seen the worst things. And still, they took from me the one thing I loved.</p> 
<p>I grabbed some dust from the rubble and let it slip through my fists. My poor Sophie...</p> 
<p>Matthew knelt down beside me. Hugh, there's more....</p> 
<p>More?What could be more? I looked into his eyes.</p> 
<p>He put a hand on my face. After you left, Sophie had a son.</p>
