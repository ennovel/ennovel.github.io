<p>Such a city I had never seen before in all my life, with its huge glittering domes, hundreds of tall towers, Roman ruins and temples, and streets paved with polished stone. Ten of Paris could have fit within its walls.</p> 
<p>And the people... crowding the massive walls, roaring with cheers. Clad in colorful, lightweight cottons and silks, in hues of crimson and purple I had never seen. Every race was represented. European, black slaves from Africa, yellows from China. And people of no stench. Who bathed and smelled of perfume, dressed up in ornate robes.</p> 
<p>Even the men!</p> 
<p>I had traveled across Europe in my youth and had played most of the large cathedral towns, but never had I seen a place like this! Gold was like tin here. Stalls and markets were crammed with the most exotic goods. I traded for a gilded perfume box to take back home for Sophie. A relic already! Nico laughed. New aromas entranced me, cumin and ginger, and there were fruits I had never tasted before: oranges and figs.</p> 
<p>I savored every exotic image, thinking of how I would describe it all to Sophie. We were hailed as heroes and we had fought almost no one. If this was how it would be, I would return both sweet smellingand free!</p> 
<p>Then the knights and nobles rallied us.Crusaders ,you are here for God's work ,not for silver and soap. We said good-bye to Constantinople, crossing the Bosporus on wooden pontoons.</p> 
<p>At last we stood in the land of the dreaded Turk!</p> 
<p>The first fortresses we encountered were empty and abandoned, towns scorched and plundered dry.</p> 
<p>The pagan is a coward, the soldiers mocked. He hides in his hole like a squirrel.</p> 
<p>We spotted red crosses painted everywhere, pagan towns now consecrated in the name of God. All signs that Peter's army had been through.</p> 
<p>The nobles pushed us hard. Hurry, you lazy louts, or the little hermit will take all the spoils.</p> 
<p>And we did hurry, though our new enemy became the blistering heat and thirst. We baked like hogs, sucking our water skins dry. The pious among us dreamed of their holy mission; the nobles, no doubt, of relics and glory; the innocent of finally proving their worth.</p> 
<p>Outside Civetot we had our first taste of the enemy. A few straggly horsemen, turbaned and cloaked in robes, ringed our ranks, lofting some harmless arrows at us, then fled into the hills like children hurling stones.</p> 
<p>Look, they run like grandmothers, Robert cackled.</p> 
<p>Send Hortense after them. I squawked about like a chicken. No doubt they are cousins of your goose.</p> 
<p>Civetot seemed deserted, an enclave of stone dwellings on the edge of a dense wood. No one wanted to delay in our rush to catch up with the army of Peter, but we needed water badly, so we decided to enter the town.</p> 
<p>On the outskirts, a grim odor pressed at my nostrils. Nicodemus glanced at me. You smell it, don't you, Hugh?</p> 
<p>I nodded. I knew the stench, from burying the dead. But this was magnified a thousand times. At first I thought it was just slaughtered livestock, or offal, but as we got closer, I saw that Civetot was smoking like burning cinders.</p> 
<p>As we entered the town there were corpses everywhere. A sea of body parts. Heads severed and gawking, limbs cut off and piled like wood, blood drenching the parched earth. It was a slaughter. Men and women hacked up like diseased stock, torsos naked and disemboweled, heads charred and roasted, hung up on spears. Red crosses smeared all over the walls-in blood.</p> 
<p>What has happened here? a soldier muttered. Some puked and turned away. My stomach felt as empty as a bottomless pit.</p> 
<p>From out of the trees, a few stragglers appeared. Their clothing was charred and tattered, their skin dark with blood and filth. They all bore the wide-eyed, hollow look of men who have seen the worst atrocities and somehow lived. It was impossible to tell if they were Christian or Turk.</p> 
<p>Peter's army has crushed the infidels, Robert called out. They've gone ahead to Antioch.</p> 
<p>But not a man among us cheered.</p> 
<p>Thisis Peter's army, Nicodemus said grimly. What remains of it.</p>
