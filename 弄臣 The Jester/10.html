<p>There were some early successes, they recounted. The Turks fled like rabbits, an old knight said. They left us their towns. Their temples. `We'll be in Jerusalem by summer,' everyone cheered. We split up our forces. A detachment, six thousand strong, pushed east to seize the Turkish fortress at Xerigordon. Rumor had it some holy relics were held ransom there. The balance of us stayed behind.</p> 
<p>After a month, word reached us that the fortress had fallen. Spoils and booty were being divvied up among the men.Saint Peter's sandals , we were told. The rest of us set out for there, eager not to miss out on the loot.</p> 
<p>It was all lies, said another in a parched, sorry voice, from infidel spies. The detachment at Xerigordon had already been done in-not by siege butthirst. The fortress lacked all water. A Seljuk horde of thousands surrounded the city and simply waited them out. And when our troops finally opened the gates in desperation, mad with thirst, they were overrun and slaughtered to a man. Six thousand, gone. Then the devils moved on to us.</p> 
<p>At first, there was thishowl from the surrounding hills... another survivor recounted, of such chilling proportion that we thought we had entered a valley of demons. We stood in our tracks and scanned the hills. Then, suddenly, daylight darkened, the sun blocked by a hail of arrows.</p> 
<p>I will never forget that deafeningwhoosh. Every next man clutching at his limbs and throat, falling to his knees. Then turbaned horsemen charged-wave after wave, hacking away at limbs and heads, our ranks shredded. Hardened knights fled terror stricken back to camp, horsemen at their tails. Women, children, the feeble and sick, unprotected-chopped to bits in their tents. The lucky among us were slain where they stood, the rest were seized, raped, cut apart limb by limb. What's left of us, I am sure, were spared just so we could bear the tale.</p> 
<p>My throat went dry.Gone...All of them... ? It could not be! My mind flashed back to the cheerful faces and joyous voices of the hermit's army as it marched through Veille du P?re. Matt, the miller's son. Jean the smith... all the young who had so eagerly signed up. There was nothing left of them?</p> 
<p>A nauseating anger boiled up in my stomach. Whatever I had come for-freedom, fortune-all that left me as if it had never been there. For the first time, I wanted not just to fight for my own gain, but to kill these curs. Pay them back!</p> 
<p>I had to leave. I ran, past Robert and Nico, past the fires to the edge of the camp.</p> 
<p>Why had I ever come to this place? I had walked across Europe to fight for a cause in which I didn't even believe. The love of my life, all that I held true and good, was a million miles away. How could all those faces-all that hope-be gone?</p>
