Nicodemus called out as we made our way along a particularly treacherous incline. The moreblasphemous the better.</p> 
<p>The trail seemed cut out of the mountain's edge, teetering over an immense chasm. One false step would mean a grisly death. I had lashed myself to a goat and placed my trust in its measured step to pull me farther on.</p> 
<p>There is the one about the convent and the whorehouse, I said, delving back to my days as an innkeeper. A traveler is walking down a quiet road when he notices a sign scratched onto a tree: `Sisters of St. Brigit Convent, House of Prostitution, two miles.'</p> 
<p>Yes, I saw it myself, a soldier exclaimed. A ways back on that last ridge. The peril of the climb was broken by a few welcome laughs.</p> 
<p>The traveler assumes it is a joke, I resumed, and continues along. Soon he comes to another sign. `Sisters of St. Brigit, House of Prostitution, one mile.' Now his curiosity is piqued. A ways ahead, there is a third sign. This time: `Convent, Brothel, next right.'</p> 
<p>`Why not?' the traveler thinks, and turns down the road until he arrives at an old stone church marked St.Brigit. He steps up and rings the bell, and an abbess answers. `What may we do for you, my son?'</p> 
<p>`I saw your signs along the road,' the traveler says. `Very well, my son,' the abbess replies. `Please, follow me.'</p> 
<p>She leads him through a series of dark, winding passages where he sees many beautiful young nuns who smile at him.</p> 
<p>Where are these nuns whenI am in need? a soldier behind me moaned.</p> 
<p>At last the abbess stops at a door, I went on. The traveler goes in and is greeted by another comely nun, who instructs him, `Place a gold coin in the cup.' He empties his pockets excitedly. `Good enough,' she says, `Now, just go through that door.'</p> 
<p>Aroused, the traveler hurries through the door, but he finds himself back outside, at the entrance, facing another sign. `Go in peace,' it reads, `and consider yourself properly screwed!'</p> 
<p>Laughter broke out from all around.</p> 
<p>I don't get it, Robert said behind me. I thought there was a brothel.</p> 
<p>Never mind. I rolled my eyes. Nico's trick had worked. For a few moments, our burden had seemed bearable. All I wanted was to get off this ridge.</p> 
<p>Suddenly I heard a rumble from above. A slide of rock and gravel hurtled down at us. I reached for Robert and pulled the boy toward the mountain's face, gripping the sheer stone as huge rocks crashed around us, missing me by the width of a blade, bouncing over the edge into oblivion.</p> 
<p>We gazed at each other with a sigh of relief, realizing how close we had come to death.</p> 
<p>Then I heard a mule bray from behind, and Nicodemus trying to settle it. Whoa... The falling rocks must have spooked it.</p> 
<p>Steady that animal, an officer barked from behind. It carries your food for the next two weeks.</p> 
<p>Nicodemus grasped for the rope. The animal's hind legs spun, trying to catch hold on the trail.</p> 
<p>I lunged for the harness around its neck, but the mule bucked again and stumbled. Its feet were unable to hold the trail. Its frightened eyes showed that the animal was aware of the danger, but the stone gave way. With a hideous bray, the poor mule toppled over the edge and fell into the void.</p> 
<p>As it did, it caused a terrible reaction, pulling along the animal behind it to which it was tied.</p> 
<p>I saw disaster looming.Nico , I shouted.</p> 
<p>But the old Greek was too slow and laden with gear to get out of the way. My eyes locked helplessly on him as he stumbled in his long robe.</p> 
<p>Nico, I screamed, seeing the old man slipping off the edge. I lunged toward him, grabbing for his arm.</p> 
<p>I was able to grip the strap of the leather satchel slung over his shoulder. It was all that kept him from plunging to his death.</p> 
<p>The old man looked up at me and shook his head. You must let go, Hugh. If you don't, we'll both fall.</p> 
<p>I won't. Reach up your other hand, I begged. A crowd of others, Robert among them, had formed behind me. Give me your hand, Nico.</p> 
<p>I searched his eyes for panic, but they were clear and sure. I wanted to say,Hold on , Professor. Jerusalem is near.</p> 
<p>But the satchel slid out of my grasp. Nicodemus, his white hair and beard billowing in the draft, fell away from me.</p> 
<p>No! I lunged, grasping, calling his name.</p> 
<p>In a flash he was gone. We had marched together for a thousand miles, but for him it was never far, alwaysnear... I didn't remember my father, but the grief emptying from me showed that Nicodemus was as close to one as I'd ever had.</p> 
<p>A knight pushed up the trail, grumbling about what the hell was going on. I recognized him as Guillaume, a vassal of Bohemond, one of the nobles in charge.</p> 
<p>He peered over the edge and swallowed. A soothsayer who couldn't even predict his own death? he spat. No great loss.</p>
