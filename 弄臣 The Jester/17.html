Get ready.... Full battle gear. We're going in,tonight !</p> 
<p>Tonight, another charge? Weary and frightened soldiers around me moaned in disbelief. Do they think we can see at night what we cannot even shoot during the day?</p> 
<p>No, this time it's different, the captain promised. Tonight you'll go to sleep fucking the emir's wife!</p> 
<p>The camp sprang alive. There was a traitor inside Antioch. He would give up the city. Antioch would finally fall. Not from its walls crumbling but from treachery and greed.</p> 
<p>Is it true? Robert asked, hastily putting on his boots. Do we finally get to pay them back?</p> 
<p>Sharpen that knife, I told the eager lad.</p> 
<p>Raymond ordered the army to break camp, giving the appearance that we were headed for a raid elsewhere. We pulled back two miles, as far as the river Orontes. Then we held until close to dawn. The signal was spread.Everyone be ready....</p> 
<p>Under the shield of darkness, we quietly crept back within sight of the city walls. A sliver of orange light was just breaking over the hills to the east. My blood was surging. Today, Antioch would fall. Then it was on to Jerusalem. Freedom.</p> 
<p>As we waited for the word, I put my hand on Robert's shoulder. Nerves?</p> 
<p>The boy shook his head. I fear not.</p> 
<p>You may have started the day still a boy, but by its end you'll be a man, I told him.</p> 
<p>He grinned sheepishly.</p> 
<p>I guess we'll both be men. I winked.</p> 
<p>Then a torch waved over the north tower. That was it! Our men were inside.Let's go ! the nobles shouted.Attack !</p> 
<p>Our army charged, Frank, Norman, Tafur, side by side, with one purpose, one mind. Show them whose God is One, the leaders cried.</p> 
<p>Our battalions headed toward the north tower, where ladders were hoisted against the walls and wave after wave of men climbed over. The sound of shouts and vicious fighting erupted from inside. Then, all at once, the big gate opened.Right in front of our eyes. But instead of attacking Moslem horsemen streaking out, our own conquering army spilled in.</p> 
<p>We made our way helter-skelter through the city. Buildings were torched. Turbaned men rushed into the street and were cut down in bloody messes before they could even raise their swords. Cries of Death to the pagans andDei leveult , God wills it, echoed everywhere.</p> 
<p>I ran in the pack, with no great malice toward the enemy but ready to fight whoever confronted me. I saw one defender cut in half by a mighty ax blow. Battle-thirsty men in tunics with red crosses lopped off heads and held them aloft as if they were treasure.</p> 
<p>In front of us a young woman ran out of a burning house, screaming. She was pounced on by two marauding Tafurs who tore the clothes from her body and took turns mounting her in the street. When they were done, they ripped a bronze bracelet from her wrist and bludgeoned her lifeless.</p> 
<p>I stared in horror at her bloody shape. In her clutched fist, I saw a cross.Good Lord , she was Christian.</p> 
<p>A moment later, from the same building, a fiery-eyed Turk, maybe her husband, charged at me with a scream. I stood paralyzed. An image of my own death rose in my mind. All I could think to utter was, It was not me....</p> 
<p>But just as the man's spear was inches from my throat, his rush was intercepted by Robert, thrusting his knife into the Turk's chest. The man staggered, his eyes horrifically wide. Then he toppled onto his wife, dead.</p> 
<p>I blinked in amazement. I turned to Robert with a sigh of relief.</p> 
<p>See, it's not just God who watches over you. He winked. It's me.</p> 
<p>He had just uttered these words when another turbaned warrior charged toward him, brandishing a long blade.</p> 
<p>The boy's back was turned, and I saw I could not get there in time. He was tugging on his knife, but it remained stuck in the dead Turk's chest. His face was still lit with that innocent grin.</p> 
<p>Robert! I screamed.Robert !</p>
