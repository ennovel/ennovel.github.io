<p>Antioch.</p> 
<p>A massive walled fortress, seemingly built into a solid mound of rock. Larger and more formidable than any castle I had ever seen back home.</p> 
<p>The sight sent a chill shooting through my bones.</p> 
<p>It was built on a sharp rise. Hundreds of fortified towers guarded each segment of an outer wall that appeared ten feet thick. We had no siege engines to break such walls, no ladders that could even scale their height. It seemed impregnable.</p> 
<p>Knights took off their helmets and surveyed the city in awe. I know the same sobering thought pounded through each of our minds.We had to take this place.</p> 
<p>I don't see any Christians chained to the walls. Robert squinted into the sun, sounding almost disappointed.</p> 
<p>If it's martyrs you're looking for, I promised grimly, don't worry, you'll have your pick.</p> 
<p>One by one, we continued along the ridge and down the narrow trail. There was a feeling that the worst was over. That whatever God had in store for us, surely the coming battles could test us no more than what we had already faced. The talk, again, was of treasure and glory.</p> 
<p>Stumbling on a ledge, I noticed a glimmer coming from under a rock. I bent down to pick up the shiny object and could not believe it.</p> 
<p>It was a scabbard, for some kind of dagger. Very old, I was sure. It looked like bronze, with some inlaid writing that I could not understand.</p> 
<p>What is it? Robert asked.</p> 
<p>I don't know. I wished Nico were here. I knew he would be able to interpret it. Maybe the language of the Jews... God, it looks old.</p> 
<p>Hugh's rich, Robert shouted. My friend is rich! Rich, I say!</p> 
<p>Quiet, a soldier hushed him. If one of our illustrious leaders hears you, you won't have your treasure for long.</p> 
<p>I placed the scabbard in my pouch, which was starting to fill up. I felt like a man who had just claimed the richest dowry. I couldn't wait to show it to Sophie! Back home, a prize like this could buy us food for a winter.</p> 
<p>I couldn't believe my good luck.</p> 
<p>Up here, the relics fall out of trees, Mouse grumbled from behind, if there were any fucking trees.</p> 
<p>The trail we walked was flat and manageable. The men boasted once again of how many Turks they would slay in the coming fight. After my discovery, thoughts of treasure and spoils seemed alive and real. Maybe I would be rich.</p> 
<p>Suddenly, up ahead, the column came to a halt. Then-eerie silence.</p> 
<p>As far as the eye could see, the trail ahead was lined with large white rocks, spaced at intervals equal to a man's arm span. Each rock was painted with a bright red cross.</p> 
<p>The bastards are welcoming us, someone said.Mocking us was more like it. The rows of red crosses sent a shiver right through me.</p> 
<p>Robert ran ahead to hurl one of the rocks toward the walls, but as he got close, the boy stopped in his tracks. Other soldiers who had reached the rocks crossed themselves.</p> 
<p>They were not rocks at all-but skulls.</p> 
<p>Thousands of them.</p>
