At any second he would strike the final blow. Yet all I could do was laugh.</p> 
<p>At what I was dying for. At the total ridiculousness of it all. At the preciousfreedom I was about to be granted at last.</p> 
<p>I looked into his hooded eyes, and though I knew it was probably my last breath, I simply could not hold back.I just laughed....</p> 
<p>My attacker hesitated, his sword poised above my head. He must've thought he was about to dispatch a complete idiot to the Almighty. He blinked at me, his brows arched, confused.</p> 
<p>I searched my mind for something to say in his tongue, which Nicodemus had taught me. Anything at all.</p> 
<p>This is your last warning, I said to him. Are you ready to give up?</p> 
<p>Then I burst out laughing once again.</p> 
<p>The massive Turk, his eyes like fiery coals, loomed over me. I waited for the death blow. Then I saw his expression relax into the slightest inkling of a smile.</p> 
<p>Choking back the laughter, I stammered, Th-the thing is... I'm not even a believer.</p> 
<p>The giant man hesitated. I didn't know if he would speak or strike. His mouth curved into a sheepish grin. Nor am I.</p> 
<p>His sword still quivered menacingly over my head. I knew any moment could be my last. I raised myself to my elbows, looked him in the eye, and said, Then, one nonbeliever to another, you must kill me in the name of what we donot embrace.</p> 
<p>Slowly, almost inexplicably, I saw the hostility on his face fade. To my utter amazement, the Turk lowered his sword. We're too few as it is, he said. No reason to make one less.</p> 
<p>Was this possible? Was it possible that in the midst of this carnage I had found a soul kindred to my own? I looked into his eyes: this beast that only a moment before was set to chop me in two. I saw something there that this whole bloody night I had not seen: virtue, humor, a human soul... I couldn't believe it.Please ,God , I finally prayed, don't let this be some kind of cruel trick.</p> 
<p>Is this real? You're going to let me go? My fingers slowly relaxed from the priest's staff.</p> 
<p>The Turk took a measuring look at me, then he nodded.</p> 
<p>You probably thought you were ridding the world of a complete madman, I said.</p> 
<p>The thought occurred. He grinned.</p> 
<p>Then my mind fixed on the danger of the moment. You'd better go. Our forces are all around. You are at risk.</p> 
<p>Go... ? The Turk seemed to sigh.Go where ? There was something in his face, no longer hatred or even amusement. It was more like resignation.</p> 
<p>At that moment, loud footsteps burst through the outer door. I heard voices. Soldiers stormed into the church. They were not wearing crosses but filthy robes. Tafurs.</p> 
<p>Get out of here, I urged the Turk. These men will show you no mercy.</p> 
<p>He took a look at his assailants. Then he merely winked at me. He started to laugh himself, then turned to face their charge.</p> 
<p>The Tafurs came upon him with their swords and awful clubs.</p> 
<p>No... I screamed. Spare this man. Spare him!</p> 
<p>He managed to kill the first one with a mighty sweep of his sword. But then he was overwhelmed, consumed by heavy blows and disemboweling slashes, never once crying out, until his powerful body resembled some hideous slab of meat and not the noble soul he was.</p> 
<p>The lead Tafur delivered one more blow to the bloody mound, then he delved through the Turk's robes, looking for something of value. Finding nothing, he shrugged to his comrades. Let's find the fucking crypt.</p> 
<p>It took everything I had not to leap on the Tafurs myself, but these savages would surely kill me.</p> 
<p>They passed by me on their way to loot the church. I was trembling with horror.</p> 
<p>The lead vermin ran the blade of his sword across my chest, as if he were evaluating whether to leave me in the same condition as the Turk. Then he sneered, amused, and said, Don't look so sad, redhead. You are free!</p>
