Father Leo, Odo, my other friends... Everyone wanted to comfort and bless me. And hear of my two years in the war.</p> 
<p>But I pushed past them. I had to go to the inn. Its ruins... I sifted through the charred wood and ash, searching for anything that breathed of her, my Sophie-a piece of cloth, a dish, a last memento of what I had lost.</p> 
<p>She spoke of you all the time, Hugh, Matthew told me. She missed you terribly. We all thought you were lost in the war. But not Sophie.</p> 
<p>You are certain, brother, that she is dead?</p> 
<p>I am. Matthew shrugged. When they took her she was already more dead than alive.</p> 
<p>But you did not actually see her die? You don't know for sure?</p> 
<p>Not for sure. But I beg you, brother, not to cling to false hope. I'm her flesh and blood. And I damn well pray she was dead as they dragged her out of here.</p> 
<p>I met his eyes. So she maynot be dead, Matthew?</p> 
<p>He looked at me quizzically. You must accept it, Hugh. If she was not then, I'm certain she was soon. Her body could have been left somewhere along the road.</p> 
<p>So you searched the road? And did you find her? Has anyone traveling from the west come upon her remains?</p> 
<p>No. No one.</p> 
<p>Then there's a chance. You say she never doubted me. That she knew I would return. Well,I do the same for her.</p> 
<p>I found myself in the part of the inn where our living space had been. Everything was cinder. Our bed, a chest of drawers... On the floor, I noticed something reflecting light.</p> 
<p>I dropped to my knees, swept away ash. My heart almost exploded with joy. Tears welled in my eyes.</p> 
<p>It was Sophie's comb. Her half of the one she'd placed in my hand the day I left. It was charred, broken; it almost crumbled in my hand. But in my blood, I felt her!</p> 
<p>I held it up, and from my pouch hastily removed the other half. I fitted them together as best I could. In that moment, Sophie came alive to me-her eyes, her laugh-as vibrantly as when I had last seen her.</p> 
<p>These knights, Matthew, they didn't leave her to die in the same flames as my son. They took her for a reason. I looked up at him, holding the comb aloft. Perhaps it is not such false hope after all.</p> 
<p>Outside, my old friends Odo and Georges the miller were waiting.</p> 
<p>Give us the word, Hugh, Georges said. We will hunt the bastards with you. We've all suffered. We know who is responsible. They deserve to die.</p> 
<p>I know. I put my hand on the miller's shoulder. But first I must find Sophie.</p> 
<p>Your wife is dead, Odo replied. We saw it, Hugh, though it seems more nightmare than real.</p> 
<p>You saw her dead? I waited for the smith to answer.</p> 
<p>I looked at Georges.Or you ?</p> 
<p>They both shrugged guiltily. They glanced at Matthew for support.</p> 
<p>Sophie lives as my own Alo lives, the miller said. In Heaven.</p> 
<p>For you, Georges, but not for me. Sophie still lives on this earth. I know it. I can feel her.</p> 
<p>I picked up my staff and pouch and slung a skin of water around my neck. I headed toward the stone bridge.</p> 
<p>What are you going to do, Hugh, jab them with that stick? Odo hurried to my side. You are just one man. With no armor or sword.</p> 
<p>I'm going to find her, Odo. I promise, I'll find Sophie.</p> 
<p>Let me get you some food, Odo pleaded. Or some ale. You still drink ale, don't you, Hugh? The army didn't cure you of that? Next I'll hear you've been going to church on Sundays.</p> 
<p>From his guarded look, it was clear he thought he would never see me again.</p> 
<p>I will bring her back, Odo. You'll see.</p> 
<p>I took my stick and headed into the woods.</p> 
<p>Toward Treille.</p>
