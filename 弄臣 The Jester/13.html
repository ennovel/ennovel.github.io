We continued to climb, but each step, all I saw in my path was the wise Greek's face.</p> 
<p>Without my noticing it at first, the trails began to widen. I realized we were marching through valleys now, not over peaks. We were heading down. Our pace quickened, and the mood in the ranks brightened with anticipation of what lay ahead.</p> 
<p>I've heard from the Spaniard there are Christians chained to the city's walls, Robert said as we marched. The sooner we get there, the sooner we can set our brothers free.</p> 
<p>Your buddy's an eager one, Hugh, Mouse called to me. You better tell him, just because you're first at the party doesn't mean you get to sleep with the mistress of the house.</p> 
<p>He wants a fight, I defended Robert, and who can blame him? We've marched a long way.</p> 
<p>From behind came the clatter of a warhorse galloping toward us. Make way!</p> 
<p>We scattered off the trail and turned to see Guillaume, the same arrogant bastard who'd mocked Nico after his death, in full armor astride his large charger. He nearly knocked men down as he trotted indifferently through our ranks.</p> 
<p>That's who we fight for, eh? I bowed sarcastically with an exaggerated flourish.</p> 
<p>We soon came to a wide clearing between mountains. A good-sized river, perhaps sixty yards wide, lay in the column's path.</p> 
<p>Up ahead, I heard nobles disagreeing on the proper spot to ford the river. Raymond, our commander, insisted that the scouts and maps suggested a point to the south. Others, eager to show our face to the Turks, the stubborn Bohemond among them, argued why lose a day.</p> 
<p>Finally, I saw that same knight, Guillaume, shoot from the crowd. I will make you a map, he shouted to Raymond. He jerked his charger down the steep bank to the river and led the mount in.</p> 
<p>Guillaume's horse waded in, bearing the knight in full chain mail. Men lined the shore, either cheering or laughing at his attempt to show off in front of royalty.</p> 
<p>Thirty yards out, the water was still no higher than the horse's ankles. Guillaume turned around and waved, a vain smile visible under his mustache. Even my mother's mother could cross here, he called. Are the mapmakers taking notes?</p> 
<p>I never knew that a peacock would so take to water, I remarked to Robert.</p> 
<p>Suddenly, in the middle of the river, Guillaume's mount seemed to stumble. The knight did his best, but in his full battle gear and on unsteady footing he couldn't hold the mount. He fell from the horse, face first into the river.</p> 
<p>The troops along the riverbank burst into laughter. Jeers, catcalls, mock waving. Oh,mapmakers... I laughed above the din. Are you taking notes?</p> 
<p>The raucous laughter continued for a time as we waited for the knight to emerge. But he did not.</p> 
<p>He stays under out of shame, someone commented. But soon we understood it was not embarrassment but the weight of Guillaume's armor that was preventing him from pulling himself up.</p> 
<p>As this became clear, the hooting ceased. Another knight galloped into the water and waded out to the spot. A full minute passed before the new rider was able to reach the area. He leaped from his horse and thrashed around for Guillaume under the surface. Then, raising the knight's heavy torso, he shouted back, He is drowned, my lord.</p> 
<p>A gasp escaped from those on shore. Men bowed their heads and crossed themselves.</p> 
<p>Just a few days before, the same Guillaume had stood behind me after Nicodemus was swept off the rocky cliff to his death.</p> 
<p>I looked at Robert, who shrugged with a thin smile. No great loss, he said.</p>
