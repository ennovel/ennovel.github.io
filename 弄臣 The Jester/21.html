Free!</p> 
<p>I started to laugh once more. The irony was bursting through my sides. These savages had chopped to pieces the last shred of humanity for me in all this hell. Now... they were setting me free!</p> 
<p>If the Turk had not hesitated just a moment ago, I'd have been dead myself. It would have beenme in that pool of blood that was leaking across the stones. Yet he'd spared me. In all this madness I had found a moment of clarity and truth with this Turk, whose name I did not even know. We'd touched souls. And the vermin had told me I was free.</p> 
<p>I struggled to my feet. I stepped over to the body of the man who had spared me and looked, horrified, at his bloody corpse. I knelt down and touched his hand.Why... ? I could walk out of this church. I could be cut down as soon as I stepped out on the street, or I could live for years, a full life. For what end?</p> 
<p>Why did you spare me? I looked into the Turk's dull, still eyes. What did you see?</p> 
<p>It was laughter that had saved me. Laughter that had somehow touched the Turk. I was only a breath away from death and yet instead of panic and fear, laughter had entered my soul. Amid all this fighting, I had simply made him smile. Now he was gone and I was here. A calm came over me.You are right ,Tafur....I am finally free.</p> 
<p>I had to get out of here. I knew I could no longer fight. I was a different man. Different from a moment ago. This cross on my tunic meant nothing to me. I stripped it from my chest. I had to go back. I had to see Sophie again. What else could matter? I was a fool to have left her.For freedom? Suddenly, the truth seemed so clear. A child could have seen it.</p> 
<p>It was only with Sophie that I felt truly free.</p> 
<p>I wanted to take something from the church with me. Something from this moment that I would have for the rest of my life. I leaned over the dead Turk. The poor warrior was empty of anything: a ring, a memento.</p> 
<p>I heard voices outside. It could be anybody. Infidels, raiders, more Tafurs hunting for spoils. I looked around.Please , something.</p> 
<p>I went back to the priest. I lifted the staff that had been in my hands when the Turk spared my life. It was a rough, gnarled Stick of wood, maybe four feet long, and thin. But it seemed strong. It would be my friend when I crossed the mountains again, my companion. I vowed to carry it with me wherever I went for the rest of my life.</p> 
<p>I looked at the fallen Turk and whispered good-bye. You're right, my friend; we are too few as it is.</p> 
<p>I gave him a wink.</p> 
<p>Looking up, I noticed a small crucifix on the altar. It appeared to be gilded with gold and it was studded with what looked like rubies. I took it down and stuffed it into my pouch. I had earned this much. A golden cross.</p> 
<p>The cries of men dying hit me as I stepped outside. Mayhem was still rampant in the streets. The conquering throng had gone deeper into Antioch, cleansing the city of anything Moslem. Bloody corpses were scattered everywhere. A few latecomers in clean armor rushed by me, eager to share in the spoils.</p> 
<p>I heard awful cries of death farther up the hill, but I wasn't going there. I put the priest's staff to the ground and took a step-the other way.</p> 
<p>Away from the senseless killing. And my regiment. Back toward the city gate.</p> 
<p>I would never see Jerusalem in this lifetime.</p> 
<p>I was heading home to Sophie.</p>
