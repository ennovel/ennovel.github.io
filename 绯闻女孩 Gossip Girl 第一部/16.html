We're raising money for them. It's a cause.” Kati wound a lock of her frizzy blond hair around her finger. “What is a peregrine falcon anyway?” she said. “Is it like a woodpecker?” “No, I think they're bigger,” Tina said. “And they eat other animals, you know, like rabbits and mice and stuff.” “Gross,” Kati said. “I just read a definition of what one was the other day,” Isabel mused. “I can't remember where I saw it.” GossipGirl.net, perhaps? “They're almost extinct,” Blair added. She thumbed through the list of people they were inviting to the party. There were three hundred and sixteen all together. All young people–no parents, thank God. Blair's eyes were automatically drawn to a name toward the bottom of the list: Serena van der Woodsen. The address given was her dorm room at Hanover Academy, in New Hampshire. Blair put the list back down on the table without correcting Serena's address. “We're going to have to spend the extra money on the printer and cut corners where we can,” she said quickly. “I can tell Takashimaya to use lilies instead of orchids and forget about the peacock feathers around the rims of the vases.” “I can do the invitations,” a small, clear voice said from behind them. “For free.” The four girls turned around to see who it was.Oh look, it's that little Ginny girl, Blair thought. The ninth grader who did the calligraphy in our school hymnals. “I can do them all by hand tonight and put them in the mail. The materials are the only cost, but I know where to get good quality paper cheap,” Jenny Humphrey said. “She did all our hymnals at school,” Kati whispered to Tina. “They look really good.” “Yeah,” Isabel agreed. “They're pretty cool.” Jenny blushed and stared at the shiny linoleum floor of the coffee shop, waiting for Blair to make up her mind. She knew Blair was the one who mattered. “And you'll do it all for free?” Blair said, suspiciously. Jenny raised her eyes. “I was kind of hoping that if I did the invites, maybe I could come to the party?” she said. Blair weighed the pros and cons in her mind. Pros: The invitations would be unique and best of all, free, so they wouldn't have to skimp on the flowers. Cons: There really weren't any. Blair looked the Ginny girl up and down. Their cute little ninth-grade helper with the huge chest. She was a total glutton for punishment, and she'd be totally out of place at the party . . . but who cared? “Sure, you can make yourself an invitation. Make one for one of your friends, too,” Blair said, handing the guest list over to Jenny. How generous. Blair gave Jenny all the necessary information, and Jenny dashed out of the coffee shop breathlessly. The stores would be closing soon, and she didn't have much time. The guest list was longer than she'd anticipated, and she'd have to stay up all night working on the invitations, but she was going to the party; that was all that mattered. Just wait until she told Dan. He was going to freak. And she was going to make him come with her to the party, whether he liked it or not. gone with the wind gone awry Two martinis and three rolls of Remi brothers' film later, Serena jumped out of a cab in front of Constance and ran up the stairs to the auditorium, where the interschool play rehearsal had already begun. As always, she was half an hour late. The sound of a Talking Heads song being played jauntily on the piano drifted down the hallway. Serena pushed open the auditorium door to find her old friend, Ralph Bottoms III, singing Burning Down the South, to the tune of Burning Down the House, with a completely straight face. He was dressed as Rhett Butler, complete with fake mustache and brass buttons. Ralph had gained weight in the last two years, and his face was ruddy, as if he'd been eating too much rare steak. He was holding hands with a stocky girl with curly brown hair and a heart-shaped face–Scarlett O'Hara. She was singing too, belting out the words in a thick Brooklyn accent. Serena leaned against the wall to watch, with a mixture of horror and fascination. The scene at the art gallery hadn't fazed her, but this–this was scary. When the song ended, the rest of the Interschool Drama Club clapped and cheered, and then the drama teacher, an aged English woman, began to direct the next scene. “Put your hands on your hips, Scarlett,” she instructed. “Show me, show me. That's it. Imagine you're the teen sensation of the Civil War South. You're breaking all the rules!” Serena turned to gaze out the window and saw three girls get out of a cab together on the corner of Ninety-third and Madison. She squinted, recognizing Blair, Kati, and Isabel. Serena hugged herself, warding off the strange feeling that had been stalking her since she'd come back to the city. For the first time in her entire life, she felt left out. Without a word to anyone in the drama club–Hello? Goodbye!–Serena slipped out of the auditorium and into the hallway outside. The wall was littered with flyers and notices and she stopped to read them. One of the flyers was for Vanessa Abrams's film tryout. Knowing Vanessa, the film was going to be very serious and obscure, but it was better than shouting goofy songs and doing the Hokey-Pokey with fat, red-faced Ralph Bottoms III. Vanessa's tryout had started an hour ago, on a bench in Madison Square Park, but maybe it was still going on. Once again, Serena found herself running for a cab, headed downtown. “This is how I want you to do it,” Vanessa told Marjorie Jaffe, a sophomore at Constance and the only girl who had shown up to try out for the role of Natasha in Vanessa's film. Marjorie had curly red hair and freckles, a little pug nose, and no neck. She chewed gum incessantly, and she was completely, nightmarishly, wrong for the part. The sun was setting, and Madison Square Park was basked in a pretty pink glow. The air had the distinct smell of New York in autumn, a mixture of smoking fireplaces, dried leaves, steaming hot dogs, dog pee, and bus exhaust. Daniel was lying on his back on the park bench the way Vanessa had told him to, a wounded soldier, with his limbs sprawled out pathetically. Wounded in war and in love, he was tragically pale and thin and rumpled-looking. A little glass crack pipe lay on his chest. Lucky Vanessa had found it on the street in Williamsburg that weekend. It was the perfect prop for her sexily damaged prince. “I'm going to read Natasha's lines. Watch carefully,” she told Marjorie. “Okay Dan, let's go.” “Haven't you been asleep?” Vanessa-as-Natasha said, peering at Dan-as-Prince Andrei. “No, I have been looking at you for a long time. I knew by instinct that you were here. No one except you gives me such a sense of gentle restfulness . . . such light! I feel like weeping from very joy,” Dan-as-Prince Andrei said quietly. Vanessa knelt at his head, her face radiant with solemn delight. “Natasha, I love you too dearly! More than all the world!” Dan gasped, trying to sit up and then sinking back on the bench as if in pain. He said he loved her! Vanessa grabbed his hand, her face flushed red at the thrill of it. She was completely caught up in the moment. Then she remembered herself, let go of Dan's hand, and stood up. “Now your turn,” she told Marjorie. “ 'Kay,” Marjorie said, chewing her gum with her mouth open. She pulled the scrunchy out of her wiry red hair and fluffed it up with her hand. Then she knelt down by Dan's bench and held up the script. “Ready?” she asked him. Dan nodded. “Haven't you been asleep?” Marjorie said, batting her eyes flirtatiously and cracking her gum. Dan closed his eyes and said his line. He could get through this without laughing if he kept his eyes closed. Halfway through the scene, Marjorie put on a fake Russian accent. It was unbelievably bad. Vanessa suffered in silence, wondering what she was going to do without a Natasha. For a moment she imagined buying a wig and playing the part herself, getting someone else to shoot it for her. But it was her project; she had to film it. Just then, someone nudged her arm and whispered, “Do you mind if I try when she's done?” Vanessa turned to find Serena van der Woodsen standing beside her, a little breathless from running across the park. Her cheeks were flushed and her eyes were as dark as the twilit sky. Serena was her Natasha, if ever there was one. Daniel bolted upright, forgetting his injuries and his line. The crack pipe rolled to the ground. “Wait, we're not done,” Marjorie said. She prodded Dan in the arm. “You're supposed to kiss my hand.” Dan stared at her blankly. “Sure,” Vanessa told Serena. “Marjorie, do you mind giving Serena your script?” Serena and Marjorie traded places. Dan had his eyes open now. He didn't dare blink. They began to read. “I have been looking at you for a long time,” Dan said, meaning every word. Serena knelt down beside him and took his hand. Dan felt faint, and he was grateful he was lying down. Whoa. Easy boy. He had been in lots of plays, but he had never felt that thing called “chemistry” before with anyone. And to be feeling it with Serena van der Woodsen was like dying an exquisite death. It felt like he and Serena were sharing the same breath. He was inhale and she was exhale. He was quiet and still, while she exploded around him like fireworks. Serena was enjoying herself too. The script was beautiful and passionate, and this scruffy Dan guy was a really good actor. I could get into this, she thought with a little thrill. She had never really thought about what she wanted to do with her life, but maybe acting was her thing. They kept reading beyond the given stopping point. It was as though they'd forgotten they were acting. Vanessa frowned. Serena was great–they were great together–but Dan was swooning. It was totally nauseating. Boys are so predictable, Vanessa thought and cleared her throat noisily. “Thanks, Serena. Thanks, Dan.” She pretended to scribble comments in her notebook. “I'll let you know tomorrow, okay?” she told Serena. In your dreams, she wrote. “That was fun!” Serena said, smiling at Dan. Dan gazed up at her dreamily from the bench, still hungover from the moment. “Marjorie, I'll let you know tomorrow, too. Okay?” Vanessa told the redhead. “ 'Kay,” Marjorie said. “Thanks.” Dan sat up, blinking. “Thanks so much for letting me try out,” Serena said sweetly, turning to go. “See you later,” Dan said, sounding drugged. “Bye,” Marjorie said, waving at him, and then rushing after Serena. “Let's practice your monologue, Dan,” Vanessa said sharply. “I want to shoot that first.” “Which subway are you taking?” Marjorie asked Serena, as they walked out of the park. “Um,” Serena said. She never took the subway, but it wouldn't kill her to ride with Marjorie. “The 6, I guess,” she said. “Hey, me too,” Marjorie said happily.
