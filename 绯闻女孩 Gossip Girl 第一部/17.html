Serena found herself jammed between a woman with a huge Daffy's bag and a fat little boy with nothing to hold onto but Serena's coat, which he kept grabbing every time the train lurched forward. Marjorie was holding onto the rail above their heads, but only her fingertips could reach it, and she kept staggering backwards, stepping on people's feet.“Don't you think Dan is majorly cute?” Marjorie asked Serena. “I can't wait until we start filming. I'll get to hang out with him every day!” Serena smiled. Obviously Marjorie thought she'd gotten the part, which was a little sad, because Serena was absolutely sure that she had the part. She had totally nailed it. Serena imagined getting to know Dan. She wondered which school he went to. He had dark, haunting eyes, and he said his lines like he meant them. She liked that. They'd have to practice quite a bit together after school. She wondered if he liked to go out, and what he liked to drink. The train came to a sudden stop at Fifty-ninth Street and Lexington–Bloomingdale's. Serena fell forward onto the little boy. “Ouch,” he said, glaring up at her. “This is my stop,” Marjorie said, pushing her way to the door. “Sorry if you didn't get the part. I'll see you at school tomorrow.” “Good luck!” Serena called. The subway car emptied out and she slid into a seat, her mind still on Dan. She imagined drinking Irish coffees with him in dark cafés and discussing Russian literature. Dan looked like he read a lot. He could give her books to read and help her with her acting. Maybe they'd even become friends. She could use some new ones. Disclaimer: All the real names of places, people, and events have been altered or abbreviated to protect the innocent.

Be on the lookout this weekend for the cool new poster decorating the sides of buses, the insides of subways, the tops of taxis, and available online through yours truly (I'm telling you, I'm connected). It's a great big picture of S–not her face, but it has her name on it so you'll know it's her. Congratulations to S on her modeling debut! SIGHTINGS B , K , and I all in 3 Guys eating fries and hot chocolates with big fat Intermix bags under the table. Don't those girls have anywhere else to go? And we thought they were always out boozing it up and partying down. So disappointing. I did see B slip a few splashes of brandy into her hot chocolate, though. Good girl. Also saw that same wigged girl going into the STD clinic downtown. If that is S , she's definitely got a bad case of the nasties. Oh, and in case you're wondering why I frequent the neighborhood of the STD clinic–I get my hair cut at a very trendy salon across the street. Your E-mail dear gossip girl, are u really even a girl? u seem like the type 2 pretend to be a girl when u'r really a 50-yrs-old bored journalist with nothing better 2 do than to harsh on kids like me. loser. –jdwack Dearest Jdwack, I'm the girliest girl you'd ever want to meet. And I'm pre-college, pre-voting age, too. How do I know you're not some fifty-year-old bitter dude with boils on your face taking his inner angst out on innocent girls like me? –GG Dear GG, I loooove your column so much I showed it to my Dad, who totally loved it!! He has friends who work at Paper and the Village Voice and other magazines. Don't be surprised if your column gets much, much bigger!! I hope you don't mind!!! Love always!!! –JNYHY Mind? No way. I'm all about being big. I'm going to be huge. No more crappy one-line parts in interschool plays for me. You might even see me on the side of a bus sometime soon. Bring it on! You know you love me, dissed at recess “Yum,” Serena said, eyeing the cookies laid out on a table in the Constance lunchroom. Peanut butter cream, chocolate chip, oatmeal. Next to the cookies were plastic cups full of orange juice or milk. A lunch lady was monitoring the cookies, making sure each girl took only two. This was recess, the daily twenty-minute break Constance gave its girls after second period, no matter what grade they were in. When the lunch lady's head was turned, Serena grabbed six peanut butter creams and glided away to stuff her face. It wasn't exactly a healthy breakfast, but it would have to do. She'd stayed up late the night before trying to read her father's leather-bound edition of War and Peace so she'd be better prepared for Vanessa's film. Whoa, War and Peace is like, two million pages long. Ever heard of CliffsNotes? Serena saw Vanessa, wearing her usual black turtleneck and bored expression, coming out of the cafeteria kitchen with a cup of tea in her hand. Serena waved a cookie at her, and Vanessa came over. “Hi,” Serena said cheerfully. “Made up your mind yet?” Vanessa sipped her tea. She'd been up half the night trying to decide between Serena and Marjorie for the part. But she couldn't get the look on Dan's face when he read with Serena out of her head. And no matter how good Serena was, she never wanted to see that look on Dan's face again. She certainly didn't want to capture it on film. “Actually, yes. I haven't told Marjorie yet,” Vanessa said calmly, “but I'm giving her the part.” Serena dropped the cookie she was eating on the floor, stunned. “Oh,” she said. “Yeah,” said Vanessa, scrambling for a decent reason why she was using Marjorie when Serena was obviously perfect for the part. “Marjorie's really rough and innocent. That's what I'm looking for. Dan and I thought your performance was just a bit too . . . um . . . polished.” “Oh,” Serena said again. She could hardly believe it. Even Dan had vetoed her? She had thought they were going to be friends. “Sorry,” Vanessa said, feeling slightly bad. She knew she shouldn't have brought Dan into it; he didn't even know she was turning Serena down. But it sounded more professional that way. Like it wasn't anything she had against Serena personally, not at all. It was strictly a business decision. “You're a good actress though,” she added. “Don't be discouraged.” “Thanks,” Serena said. Now she wasn't going to hang out with Dan and practice their lines like she'd imagined. And what was she going to tell Ms. Glos? She still didn't have any extracurriculars, and no halfway decent college was going to want her. Vanessa walked away, looking for Marjorie so she could tell her the good news. She was going to have to change the entire film now that Marjorie was her star. It would have to be a comedy. But at least she had saved herself from making Endless Love in the Park After Dark, starring Serena van der Woodsen and Daniel Humphrey. Blech. Serena stood in the corner of the cafeteria, the remaining cookies crumbling in her hand. Gone With the Wind was a total cheese-fest, and she was too polished for War and Peace. What else could she do? She chewed on her thumbnail, deep in thought. Maybe she could make a movie of her own. Blair took film–she could help. When they were younger they'd always talked about making movies. Blair was always going to be the star, wearing cool Givenchy outfits like Audrey Hepburn, except Blair preferred Fendi. And Serena always wanted to direct. She would wear floppy linen pants and shout through a bullhorn and sit in a chair with the word “director” on it. This was their chance. “Blair,” Serena nearly shouted when she saw Blair by the milk table. She rushed over to her, overcome by the brilliance of her idea.
