Her voice had sounded lonely and sad and very far away, even though she lived only a block and a half away from him. Nate had never heard Serena sound so down. And since when did Serena van der Woodsen go to bed early? Nate sat down in front of one of the humming PCs in the lab. He clicked on the New Mail window and typed a message to Serena's old Constance e-mail address. He didn't know if she would check it or not, but it was worth a try. TO: serenavdw@constancebillard.edu FROM: narchibald@stjudes.edu Hey. What are you up to? I got your message last night. Sorry I wasn't there. I will definitely see you Friday, okay? Love, Nate. Then he opened up his own e-mail. Surprise, surprise, there was a note from Blair. They hadn't talked since her mother's party the night before last. TO: narchibald@stjudes.edu FROM: blairw@constancebillard.edu Dear Nate. I miss you. Monday night was supposed to be really special. Before we got interrupted I was planning for us to do something we've been talking about doing for a while. I think you know what I'm talking about. The timing wasn't right, I guess. I just wanted to tell you that I'm ready to do it. I wasn't ready before, but now I am. My Mom and Cyrus are going away on Friday and I really want you to sleep over. I love you. Call me. Love, Blair. Nate read Blair's e-mail twice and then closed the file so he wouldn't have to look at it anymore. It was only Wednesday. Was it possible that Blair could remain ignorant about him and Serena until Friday, even though she was in school with Serena every day and they were best friends and told each other everything? Chances were, no. And what about Chuck Bass? He wasn't exactly good at keeping secrets. Nate rubbed his pretty green eyes viciously. It didn't matter how Blair found out. Any way he looked at it, he was fucked. He tried to come up with a plan, but the only plan he could think of was to wait and see what happened when he saw Blair on Friday night. There was no point in getting all worked up about it now. Just then the door to the computer lab opened, and Jeremy Scott Tompkinson poked his head around the door. “Yo, Nathaniel, we're cutting Gym. Come to the park with us and play some ball.” The second bell rang. Nate was late for Gym anyway, and after Gym he had lunch. Cutting sounded like an excellent idea. “Yeah, sure,” Nate said. “Hold on a sec.” He clicked on Blair's e-mail and dragged it across the screen and into the trash. “Okay,” he said, standing up. “Let's go.” Hmmm, if he really loved her, he probably would've saved the e-mail, or at least answered it, right? It was a sunny October day in Central Park. Out in Sheep Meadow lots of kids were cutting school, just lying in the grass, smoking, or playing Frisbee. The trees surrounding the meadow were a blaze of yellows, oranges, and reds, and beyond the trees loomed the beautiful old apartment buildings on Central Park West. A guy was selling weed, and Anthony Avuldsen bought some to add to what Nate had picked up at the pizza place yesterday at lunch. Nate, Jeremy, Anthony, and Charlie Dern passed an enormous joint between them as they dribbled a soccer ball around on the grass. Charlie puffed on the joint and passed it to Jeremy. Nate shot him the ball and Charlie tripped over it. He was six feet tall, and his head was too big for his body. People called him Frankenstein. Ever the blond athletic one, even when he was stoned, Anthony dove for the ball, kicked it up in the air and headed it at Jeremy. It hit Jeremy in his puny chest and he let it roll to the ground, dribbling it between his feet. “Shit, this stuff is strong,” Jeremy said, hitching up his pants. They were always sliding down below his skinny hips, no matter how tightly he buckled his belt. “Yeah, it is,” Nate agreed. “I'm all fucked up.” His feet were itchy. It felt like the grass was growing through the rubber soles of his sneakers. Jeremy stopped dribbling the ball. “Hey, Nate. Have you seen Serena van der Woodsen yet?” he asked. “I heard she's back.” Nate looked at the ball longingly, wishing he had it so he could dribble it away across the field and pretend he hadn't heard Jeremy's question. He could feel the other three boys staring at him. He bent down and pulled his left shoe off so he could scratch the bottom of his foot. Damn, it itched. “Yeah, I saw her Monday,” he said casually, hopping up and down on one foot. Charlie cleared his throat and spit in the grass. “What'd she look like?” he asked. “I heard she got into all sorts of trouble up at Hanover.” “Me too,” Anthony said, sucking on the roach. “I heard she got kicked out for having sex with this whole group of guys in her room. Her roommate ratted her out.” He laughed. “Like, couldn't she afford a hotel room?” Charlie laughed. “I heard she has a kid. I'm serious. She had it in France and left it there. Her parents are paying to have it raised in some fancy French convent. It's like a fucking movie, man.” Nate couldn't believe what he was hearing. He dropped his shoe and sat down in the grass. Then he took off his other shoe and pulled off both of his socks. He didn't say anything, he just sat there, scratching his bare feet. “Can you imagine Serena with all these guys in her dorm room? Like, Ooh, baby. Harder, harder!” Jeremy fell down on the grass, rubbing his skinny belly and cackling hysterically. “Oh, man!” “Wonder if she even knows who the daddy is,” Anthony said. “I heard there was a pretty major drug thing going on, too,” Charlie said. “She was dealing and got addicted to whatever it was. She was in rehab in Switzerland all summer. After the baby was born, I guess.” “Whoa, that is fucked up,” Jeremy said. “You and her had a thing, didn't you, Nate?” Charlie said. “Where'd you hear that?” Nate asked, frowning. Charlie shook his head and smiled. “I don't know, man. Around. What's the problem? She's hot.” “Yeah, well, I've had hotter,” Nate said, and immediately regretted it. What was he talking about? “Yeah, Blair's pretty hot too, I guess,” Charlie said. “I bet she gets pretty crazy in bed,” Jeremy agreed.
