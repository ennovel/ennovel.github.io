He put his finger to his lips and crept up to the front door of the building. Then he knocked loudly on the glass door. “Hello?” he shouted. “Oh, Nate,” Serena laughed. “You are so mean!” Roland snapped his eyes open and nearly fell off his chair. Then he opened the door for them, and Serena and Nate ran inside and rode the elevator up to Serena's apartment. Serena led the way to her room and sat down heavily on the bed. “Did you get my message?” she yawned at Nate, pulling off her boots. “I thought you'd come out tonight.” “I couldn't,” Nate said. He picked up the little glass ballerina perched on top of Serena's mahogany jewelry chest. She had the tiniest toes, like little pinpoints. He'd forgotten about her. “Well, it wasn't worth it anyway,” Serena sighed. She lay down on the bed. “I am so tired,” she said. She patted the bed next to her and slid over to give Nate room. “Come lie down and tell me a bedtime story?” Nate put the ballerina down and swallowed. Breathing in the scent of Serena's room with Serena in it made his heart hurt. He lay down next to her, their bodies touching. Nate put his arm around Serena and she kissed his cheek, snuggling in close. “I was just over at Blair's,” Nate said. But Serena didn't answer. She was breathing steadily. Maybe she was already asleep. Nate lay still, with his eyes open wide, his mind racing. He wondered if he and Blair were officially broken up now. He wondered if he kissed Serena right now, full on the lips and told her he loved her, how she'd respond. He wondered if he'd just gone ahead and had sex with Blair if everything would have been all right. Nate cast his eyes around the room, taking in all the familiar well-loved objects that he'd grown up seeing and forgotten all about. The kilt-wearing teddy bear from Scotland that sat aristocratically on Serena's little dressing table. The big mahogany armoire with its drawers half open and all her clothes spilling out of it. The little brown burn mark he'd made in ninth grade on the white canopy hanging from her bed. On the floor by the door was Serena's red velvet bag. The contents had spilled out of it. A blue pack of Gauloise cigarettes. A twenty-dollar bill. An Amex card. And a navy blue scarf with the letters C.B. stitched on it in gold. Why had she needed to borrow money from him when she had twenty dollars with her? Nate wondered. And what the hell was she doing with Chuck Bass's scarf? Nate turned over on his side and Serena moaned softly as her head rolled back on the pillow. He studied her critically. She was so beautiful and sexy and trusting, and so full of surprises. It was hard to believe she was actually for real. Serena reached up and put her arms around Nate's neck, pulling him toward her. “Come on,” she murmured, her eyes still closed. “Sleep with me.” Nate's whole body tensed. He didn't know if Serena meant just go to sleep or sleep with her, but he was definitely aroused. Any boy in his right mind would be, which is exactly what turned Nate off.There was something so careless about the way Serena had said it. Nate suddenly had no trouble imagining her doing the things he'd heard she'd done. With Serena, anything was possible. A glitter of silver caught his eye. It was the tiny silver box Serena kept on her bedside table, full of her baby teeth. Every time he came over, Nate used to open up the velvet-lined box to see if all the teeth were still there. But not this time. From the look of things, Serena wasn't the same little girl who'd lost all those teeth. Nate pulled away from her and stood up. He snatched up Chuck's scarf and tossed it on the bed, not noticing that it was streaked with vomit. And then, without even looking at Serena again, he left, slamming the door behind him. Chicken. At the sound of the door closing Serena opened her eyes and breathed in the scent of her own barf. Gagging, she threw the covers back and ran to the bathroom. She clutched the rim of her white porcelain sink and heaved into it, her sides hurting with the effort. Nothing came out. Serena turned on the shower as hot as it would go and pulled her clammy Pucci dress over her head, dropping it on the floor. All she needed was a good hot shower and a little exfoliant. Tomorrow she'd be good as new. Disclaimer: All the real names of places, people, and events have been altered or abbreviated to protect the innocent. Namely, me.hey people! THE VIRGIN ISSUE Can you believe N? He was thisclose to getting a nice slice of B pie, if you know what I mean. I guess we're supposed to admire his self-control, his ability to keep the old hot dog in the bun. But I bet B really wouldn't have minded too much if N had just kept his mouth shut and got on with it instead of getting all moral on her and telling her all about his time with S. I mean, who's B going to lose it to now?I was wrong about boys. I always thought they'd do anything to bag a virgin. I mean, I thought N would like the idea that B has never done it. But he doesn't seem to care about that at all. All it does is make having sex with her this huge thing that he can't deal with without smoking a big fattie and downing half a bottle of JD. So disappointing.Not that he was too quick to jump S's bones either, and we all know she's no virgin.Maybe N just has high moral standards.Ooh, that makes me like him even more. Your E-mail Hey gossip girl,i saw S go upstairs with some dude at the Tribeca Star. she was wasted. i was kind of tempted to knock on the door and see if there was a party going on or s/t, but i chickened out. i just wanted your advice. do you think she'd do me? i mean, she looks pretty easy.–Coop Dear Coop, If you're the type of guy who has to ask, then probably not. S may be a ho, but she has excellent taste. –GG SIGHTINGS Just one: N at the burrito place on Lexington, chatting up the cute girl behind the counter. She gave him extra guacamole for free. Yeah, I bet she did.You know you love me, westsiders go bonkers for barneys “Dan,” Jenny whispered, poking at her brother's chest. “Wake up.” Dan flung his hand over his eyes and kicked at his sheets. “Go away. It's Saturday,” he mumbled. “Please get up,” Jenny whined. She sat down on the bed, poking him repeatedly until he removed his arm to glare at her. “What's your problem?” Dan said. “Leave me alone.” “No,” Jenny insisted. “We have to go shopping.” “Right,” Dan said. He rolled over, turning his head toward the wall. “Please, Dan. I have to get a dress for the party on Friday and you have to help me. Dad gave me his credit card. He said you could get a tux, too.” Jenny giggled. “Since we're turning out to be the type of spoiled rotten kids that will need tuxes and dresses and all that crap.” Dan rolled over. “I'm not going to that party,” he said.“Shut up. Yes you are. You're going and you're going to meet Serena and dance with her. I'll introduce you. She's totally cool,” Jenny burbled happily. “No,” Dan said stubbornly. “Well, you can at least help me pick out a dress,” Jenny pouted. “Because I'm going. And I want to look nice.” “Can't Dad go with you?” Dan asked. “Yeah, right. I said I wanted to look nice,” Jenny scoffed. “You know what Dad told me? He said, 'Go to Sears, it's the proletarian department store.' Whatever that means. I don't even know where Sears is, if it even exists anymore. Anyway, I want to go to Barneys. I can't believe I've never even been there. I bet people like Serena van der Woodsen and Blair Waldorf go there, like, every day.” Dan sat up and yawned loudly. Jenny was all dressed and ready to go, with her curly hair pulled back into a ponytail. She even had her jacket and shoes on. She looked so cute and eager, it was kind of hard to say no. “You're such a pain in my ass,” Dan said, standing up and stumbling toward the bathroom. “You know you love me,” Jenny called after him. As far as Dan was concerned, Barneys was full of assholes, down to the dude who opened the door for him, smiling in the cheesiest way possible. But Jenny loved it, and even though she had never been there, she seemed to know everything about the place. She knew not to bother with the lower floors, which were full of designer clothes she could never afford, and headed straight to the top floor Co-op. And when the elevator doors rolled open, she felt like she had died and gone to heaven. There were so many beautiful dresses hanging on the racks it made her salivate to look at them. She wanted to try them all on, but of course she couldn't. When you're a 34D, you're kind of limited. And you definitely need help. “Dan, will you go ask that woman to help me find this in my size,” Jenny whispered, fingering a purple velvet empire-waist sheath with beaded straps. She pulled out the price tag. Six hundred bucks. “Jesus Christ!” Dan said, looking at the price over her shoulder. “No way.” “I'm just trying it on for fun,” Jenny insisted. “I won't buy it.” She held the dress up to herself. The bodice would barely cover her nipples. Jenny sighed and put the dress back on the rack. “Would you please ask that lady if she'll help me?” she repeated. “Why can't you ask?” Dan said. He shoved his hands in his corduroys and leaned against a wooden hat rack. “Please?” Jenny said. “Fine.” Dan strode over to a haggard looking woman with frosted blond hair. She looked like she'd been working in department stores her entire life, only taking one vacation a year in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Dan imagined her chain-smoking Virginia Slims down on the boardwalk, worrying about how the girls back at the store were managing without her. “Can I help you, young man?” the woman asked him. Her name tag said “Maureen.” Dan smiled. “Hello. Do you think you could help my sister find a nice dress? She's over there.” He pointed at Jenny, who was studying the price tag of a red silk wraparound with ruffles on the sleeves.Jenny had taken off her jacket and was wearing a white T-shirt. Dan could not deny it. Her boobs were really huge. “Yes, of course,” Maureen said, striding purposefully toward Jenny. Dan stayed where he was, glancing around the room and feeling completely out of place. Behind him, he heard a familiar voice. “I look like a nun, Mom, I swear. It's just completely wrong.” “Oh, Serena,” another voice said. “I think it's darling. What if you just unbutton the collar a bit. There. See? It's very Jackie O.” Dan spun around. A tall, middle-aged woman with Serena's coloring was standing half in, half out of a curtained dressing room. The curtain was slightly parted, and Dan could just see a bit of Serena's hair, her collarbone, her bare feet, the toenails painted dark red. His cheeks burned, and he bolted for the elevator. “Hey Dan, where're you going?” Jenny called over to him. Her arms were already piled high with dresses, and Maureen was flicking efficiently through the racks, while giving her all sorts of good advice about support bras and the latest figure-enhancing underwear. Jenny had never been happier. “Gonna check out the men's stuff,” Dan mumbled, glancing nervously toward the side of the room where he'd spotted Serena. “Okay,” Jenny said gaily. “I'll meet you down there in forty-five minutes. And if I need your help, I'll call you on your cell.” Dan nodded and leapt onto the elevator as soon as it opened. Down in the men's department, he ambled over to a counter and spritzed his hands with Gucci cologne, wrinkling his nose at the strong, Italian, male scent. He looked around the intimidating, woody room for a bathroom where he could wash it off. Instead, he found a mannequin in full evening dress and beside it, a rack full of tuxes. Dan fingered the rich material of the jackets and looked at the labels. Hugo Boss, Calvin Klein, DKNY, Armani. He imagined stepping out of a limo wearing his Armani tux with Serena on his arm. They'd stroll down the red carpet leading into the party, music thumping all around them, and people would turn and say, “Oh,” in hushed voices. Serena would press her perfect mouth to Dan's ear. “I love you,” she'd whisper. Then Dan would stop and kiss her and pick her up and carry her back to the limo. Screw the party. They had better things to do. “Can I help you, sir?” A salesman asked. Dan turned abruptly. “No. I–” He hesitated and looked at his watch. Jenny was going to take forever upstairs, and why shouldn't he? As long as he was there. He picked up the Armani tux and held it out to the sales guy. “Can I try this one on in my size?” he said. The cologne must have gone to his head. Jenny and Maureen had completely scoured the racks, and Maureen had filled a dressing room with dozens of possibilities in assorted sizes. The problem with Jenny was she was only a size two, but her chest was a size eight at least. Maureen thought they'd have to compromise and go for a six, letting it out in the bust and taking it in everywhere else. The first few dresses were a disaster. Jenny nearly busted the zipper of one trying to unsnag it from her bra. And the next one didn't even make it over her boobs. The third one was completely obscene. The fourth one fit, sort of, except it was bright orange and had a ridiculous ruffle running across it, like someone had slashed it with a knife. Jenny poked her head out of the curtain to look for Maureen.
