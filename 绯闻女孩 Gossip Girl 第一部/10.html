It was Blair Waldorf, laughing out loud as she read the note Rain Hoffstetter had just passed her. For a good time ?call Serena v.d. Woodsen ?Get it –VD?? Vanessa glared at Blair. Film was Vanessa's favorite class, the only reason she came to school at all. She took it very seriously, while most of the other girls, like Blair, were only taking Film as a break from Advanced Placement hell–AP Calculus, AP Bio, AP History, AP English Literature, AP French. They were on the straight and narrow path to Yale or Harvard or Brown, where their families had all gone for generations. Vanessa wasn't like them. Her parents hadn't even gone to college. They were artists, and Vanessa wanted only one thing in life: to go to NYU and major in film. Actually, she wanted something else. Or someone else, to be precise, but we'll get to that in a minute. Vanessa was an anomaly at Constance, the only girl in the school who had a nearly shaved head, wore black turtlenecks every day, read Tolstoy's War and Peace over and over like it was the Bible, listened to Belle and Sebastian, and drank unsweetened black tea. She had no friends at all at Constance, and lived in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with her twenty-two-year-old sister, Ruby. So what was she doing at a tiny, exclusive private girls' school on the Upper East Side with princesses like Blair Waldorf? It was a question Vanessa asked herself every day. Vanessa's parents were older, revolutionary artists who lived in a house made out of recycled car tires in Vermont. When she turned fifteen, they had allowed the perpetually unhappy Vanessa to move in with her bass guitarist older sister in Brooklyn. But they wanted to be sure she got a good, safe, high-school education, so they made her go to Constance. Vanessa hated it, but she never said anything to her parents. There were only eight months left until graduation. Eight more months and she would finally escape downtown to NYU. Eight more months of bitchy Blair Waldorf, and even worse, Serena van der Woodsen, who was back in all her splendor. Blair Waldorf looked like she was absolutely orgasmic over the return of her best friend. In fact, the whole back row of Film Studies was atwitter, passing notes tucked into the sleeves of their annoying cashmere sweaters. Well, fuck them. Vanessa lifted her chin and went on with her presentation. She was above their petty bullshit. Only eight more months. Perhaps if Vanessa had seen the note Kati Farkas had just passed to Blair, she might have had a tad more sympathy for Serena. Dear Blair, Can I borrow fifty thousand dollars? Sniff, sniff, sniff. If I don't pay my coke dealer the money I owe him, I'm in big trouble. Shit, my crotch itches. Let me know about the money. Love,Serena v.d. Woodsen Blair, Rain, and Kati giggled noisily. “Shhssh,” Mr. Beckham whispered, glancing at Vanessa sympathetically. Blair turned the note over and scrawled a reply. Sure, Serena. Whatever you want. Call me from jail. I hear the food is really good there. Nate and I will visit you whenever we're free, which might be . . . I don't know . . . NEVER?! I hope the VD gets better soon. Love,Blair Blair handed the note back to Kati, feeling only the tiniest speck of remorse for being so mean. There were so many stories about Serena flying around, she honestly didn't know what to believe anymore. Plus, Serena still hadn't actually told anyone what she was doing back, so why should Blair say anything in her defense? Maybe some of it was true. Maybe some of this stuff had really happened. Besides, passing notes is so much more fun than taking them. “So I'm going to be writing, directing, and filming this. And I've already cast my friend, Daniel Humphrey, from Riverside Prep, as Prince Andrei,” Vanessa explained. Her cheeks heated up when she uttered Dan's name. “But I still need a Natasha for the scene. I'm casting her tomorrow after school, in Madison Square Park at dusk. Anyone interested?” she asked. The question was a private little joke with herself. Vanessa knew no one in the room was even listening to her; they were too busy passing notes. Blair's arm shot up. “I'll be the director!” she announced. Obviously she hadn't heard the question, but Blair was so desperate to impress the admissions office at Yale, she was always the first to volunteer for anything. Vanessa opened her mouth to speak. Direct this, she wanted to say, giving Blair the finger. “Put your hand down, Blair,” Mr. Beckham sighed tiredly. “Vanessa just got through telling us she is directing and writing and filming. Unless you'd like to try out for the part of Natasha, I suggest you focus on your own project.” Blair glared sourly at him. She hated teachers like Mr. Beckham. He had such a chip on his shoulder because he was from Nebraska and had finally attained his sad dream of living in New York City only to find himself teaching a useless class instead of directing cutting edge films and becoming famous. “Whatever,” Blair said, tucking her dark hair behind her ears. “I guess I really don't have time.” And she didn't. Blair was chair of the Social Services Board and ran the French Club; she tutored third graders in reading; she worked in a soup kitchen one night a week, had SAT prep on Tuesdays, and on Thursday afternoons she took a fashion design course with Oscar de la Renta. On weekends she played tennis so she could keep up her national ranking. Besides all that, she was on the planning committee of every social function anyone would be bothered to go to, and the fall/winter calendar was busy, busy, busy. Her PalmPilot was always running out of memory. Vanessa flicked on the lights and walked back to her seat at the front of the room. “It's okay, Blair, I wanted a blond girl for Natasha anyway,” she said. Vanessa smoothed her uniform around her thighs and sat down daintily, in an almost perfect imitation of Blair. Blair smirked at Vanessa's prickly shaved head and glanced at Mr. Beckham, who cleared his throat and stood up. He was hungry, and the bell was going to ring in five minutes. “Well, that's it, girls. You can leave a little early today. Vanessa, why don't you put up a sign-up sheet in the hall for your casting tomorrow?” The girls began to pack up their bags and file out of the room. Vanessa ripped a blank sheet of paper out of her notebook and wrote the necessary details at the top of it. War and Peace. Short film. Try out for Natasha. Wednesday P.M., sunset. Madison Square Park. Park bench, Northeast corner. She resisted writing an exact description of the girl she was looking for, because she didn't want to scare anyone away. But she had a clear picture in her mind, and it wasn't going to be easy to find the right girl. Her perfect Natasha would be pale and blond, a natural dirty blond. She wouldn't be too obviously pretty, but she'd have the kind of face that made you want to look at it. She would be the kind of girl to make Dan glow–full of movement and laughter–exactly the opposite of Dan's quiet energy, which burned deep inside him and made his hands shake sometimes. Vanessa hugged herself. Just thinking about Dan made her feel like she had to pee. Under that shaved head and that impossible black turtleneck, she was just a girl. Face it: we're all the same. a power lunch “The invitations, the gift bags, and the champagne. That's all we have left to do,” Blair said. She lifted a cucumber slice off her plate and nibbled at it thoughtfully. “Kate Spade is still doing the gift bags, but I don't know–do you think Kate Spade is too boring?” “I think Kate Spade is perfect,” Isabel said, winding her dark hair into a knot on top of her head. “I mean, think how cool it is to have a plain black handbag now instead of all those animal prints and military shit everyone has. It's all such . . . bad taste, don't you think?” Blair nodded. “Completely,” she agreed. “Hey, what about my leopard skin coat?” Kati said, looking hurt. “Yes, but that's real leopard skin,” Blair argued. “That's different.” The three girls were sitting in the Constance cafeteria, discussing the upcoming Kiss on the Lips benefit to raise money for the Central Park Peregrine Falcon Foundation. Blair was chair of the organizing committee, of course. “Those poor birds,” Blair sighed. As if she could give two shits about the damned birds. “I really want this party to be good,” she said. “You guys are coming to my meeting tomorrow, right?” “Of course we're coming,” Isabel said. “What about Serena–did you tell her about the party? Is she going to help?” Blair stared blankly back at her.
