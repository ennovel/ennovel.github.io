Was this all there was? Was Nate it? Blair didn't have much choice. She opened her eyes wide, silently asking Nate for help and praying he'd be up to the job. Ms. Agnelli frowned and turned around to see what Blair was staring at. Blair made a run for it, and Nate stepped in just in time. Thank God he was so stoned. “Nate Archibald,” Nate said, shaking hands with the woman. “My mother is a big fan of those falcons.” Ms. Agnelli laughed and blushed a little. What a charming young man. “Well, of course she is,” she said. “Your family has been very generous with our foundation.” Nate plucked two flutes of champagne off a passing tray and handed one to her. He raised his glass. “To the birds,” he said, clinking his glass with hers and trying to fend off an outbreak of the giggles. Ms. Agnelli blushed again. This boy was too cute! “Hey, those two girls helped plan the party, too,” Nate said, pointing at Kati and Isabel, who were standing on the edge of the dance floor, useless as usual. He waved them over. “Hello, Nate,” said Kati, tottering over on four-inch stilettos. Isabel clutched her drink and stared at the strange woman standing next to Nate. “Hi,” she said. “I love your suit.” “Thank you, dear. I'm Rebecca Agnelli, from the Central Park Save the Peregrine Falcons Foundation,” the woman said. She held her hand out to Isabel, who reached out with both arms to give her a drunken hug. “Excuse me,” said Nate, bowing out right on cue. “Blair?” Nate called, cautiously pushing open the ladies' room door. “Are you in there?” Blair was crouched in the end stall. “Shit,” she said softly, wiping her mouth with toilet paper. She stood up and flushed. “I'll be right out,” she said, waiting for him to leave. But Nate pushed the ladies' room door open all the way and stepped inside. On a counter by the sinks were little bottles of Evian, perfume, hairspray, Advil, and hand lotion. He unscrewed a bottle of water and shook a couple Advil onto his palm. Blair opened the stall door. “You're still here,” she said. Nate handed her the pills and the water. “I'm still here,” he repeated. Blair swallowed the pills, sipping the water slowly. “I'm really fine,” she said. “You can go back to the party.” “You look nice,” Nate said, ignoring her. He reached out and rubbed one of Blair's bare shoulders. Her skin felt warm and soft, and Nate wished they could lie down on her bed and fall asleep together like they always used to. “Thanks,” said Blair, her lower lip beginning to tremble. “So do you.” “I'm sorry, Blair. I really am,” Nate began. Blair nodded and began to cry. Nate pulled a paper towel from the dispenser and handed it to her.“I think the only real reason I did it . . . I mean, that I did it with Serena . . . is because I knew she'd do it,” he said, grasping for the right words. “But it was you I wanted all along.” Nice one. Blair swallowed. He'd said it just right, exactly the way she'd written it in the script in her head. She put her arms around Nate's neck and let him hold her. His clothes smelled like pot. Nate pushed her away and looked down into her eyes. “So everything is okay now?” he said. “You still want me?” Blair caught the reflection of the two of them together in the bathroom mirror and gazed up into Nate's gorgeous green eyes and nodded yes. “But only if you promise to stay away from Serena,” she sniffled. Nate wound a strand of Blair's hair around his finger and breathed in the scent of her perfume. It felt okay, standing there, holding her. It felt like something he could do. For now, and maybe forever. He didn't need Serena. He nodded. “I promise.” And then they kissed–a sad, soft kiss. In her head, Blair could hear the swell of music signaling the end of the scene. It had started out a little rocky, but at least the ending was okay. “Come on,” she said, pulling away and wiping the mascara smudges from under her eyes. “Let's go see who's here.” Holding hands, they left the ladies' room. Kati Farkas smiled knowingly as she tottered past them on the way in. “You guys,” she scolded. “Get a room!” s and d get down “This band rocks!” Serena shouted at Vanessa over the pounding drum and bass. She wriggled her butt from side to side in her chair, her eyes shining. Dan was having trouble breathing normally. He'd barely touched his drink. Vanessa smiled, pleased that Serena liked the music. Personally, she hated it, although she'd never tell her sister Ruby that. SugarDaddy was all about people dancing and sweating and shaking their bodies around, which was definitely not Vanessa's thing. She'd rather lie around in the dark listening to Gregorian chants or whatever. Yeehaw! “Come on,” Serena said, standing up. “Let's dance.” Vanessa shook her head. “That's okay,” she said. “You go.” “Dan?” Serena said, tugging on his jacket sleeve. “Come on!” Dan never, ever danced. He was bad at it, and it made him feel like a goofball. He hesitated, glancing at Vanessa, who raised her black eyebrows, challenging him. If you get up and dance right now, you will go straight to the top of my loser list, her look said. Dan stood up. “Sure, why not,” he said. Serena grabbed his hand and pushed her way into the gyrating throng with Dan stumbling after her. Then Serena began to dance, her arms raised over her head, kicking her feet out in front of her and shaking her shoulders. She definitely knew how to dance. Dan nodded his head up and down and waggled his knees in time to the beat, watching her. Serena reached out and clasped Dan's hips, rocking them back and forth and around and around, mimicking what her hips were doing all on their own. Dan laughed and Serena smiled and closed her eyes, getting seriously down. Dan closed his eyes too, letting his body follow hers. It really didn't matter that he danced like a moron, or that he was the only one in the room wearing a tuxedo–probably the only one in Williamsburg. He was with her, and that was what mattered. Alone at the table, Vanessa finished first her drink and then Dan's. Then she got up and went to sit down at the bar. “Nice shirt,” the bartender remarked when he saw her. He was in his early twenties, with red hair, long sideburns, and a cute, sly smile. Her sister was always talking about how cute he was. “Thanks,” Vanessa said, smiling back at him. “It's new.” “You should wear red more often,” he said. He held his hand out. “I'm Clark. You're Vanessa, right? Ruby's sister?” Vanessa nodded. She wondered if he was just being nice to her because he liked her sister. “Can I tell you a secret?” Clark said. He poured a few different things into a martini shaker and shook it up. Oh, fuck, Vanessa thought. Here's when he pours out his heart and tells me all about how he's been in love with Ruby forever, but she doesn't seem to notice him. And he wants me to play Cupid and blah, blah, blah. “What?” she said. “Well,” Clark said. “I see you and Ruby come in here all the time.” Here he goes, thought Vanessa. “And you never come up to the bar and talk to me. But I've kind of had a crush on you since I first saw you.” Vanessa stared at him. Was he joking? Clark poured the drink out of the martini shaker into a short little glass and squeezed a few limes into it. He pushed it toward her. “Try that,” he said. “It's on the house.” Vanessa picked up the glass and tasted it. It tasted sweet and sour at the same time, and she couldn't taste any alcohol in it at all. It was good. “What's it called?” she said. “Kiss me,” Clark said, with an absolutely straight face. Vanessa put the drink down and leaned over the bar. Serena and Dan could dance their pretty asses off for all she cared. She was about to be kissed. The Kiss on the Lips DJ had just broken up with her boyfriend of four years and was playing sad, slow, love songs back to back. Gorgeously dressed couples held onto each other and swayed to the lonesome riffs, barely moving beneath the soft lights. The air smelled of orchids and candle wax and raw fish and cigarette smoke, and there was a peaceful sophistication to the evening that was both unexpected and familiar. It wasn't the rocking slam-fest that some had hoped for, but it wasn't a bad party, either. There was still plenty of booze left, nothing had caught fire, and the cops hadn't shown up to card people. Besides, the year was just getting started–there were tons more parties to look forward to. Nate and Blair were dancing together, her cheek against his chest, both of their eyes closed, his lips brushing the top of her head. Blair had put her brain on pause, and her head was full of static. She was tired of dreaming up movies. Right now, real life suited her just fine. A few couples away, Chuck had his hands full of Jenny Humphrey. Jenny wished the DJ would bring up the tempo. She was trying to dance as fast as she could, to keep Chuck from groping her, but it was having the opposite effect. Every time she moved her shoulders, her boobs bounced out of her dress and practically hit him in the face. Chuck was absolutely delighted. He put his arms around Jenny's waist and pulled her close, dancing off the dance floor and into the ladies' room. “What are we doing?” Jenny said, confused. She gazed up into his eyes. She knew Chuck was friends with Serena and Blair, and she wanted to trust him. But Chuck still hadn't asked her what her name was. He'd barely spoken to her at all. “I just want to kiss you,” Chuck said. He bent his head down and enveloped her mouth in his, pressing his tongue against her teeth with such force that she let out a little gasp. Jenny opened her mouth and let him thrust his tongue deep into her throat. She had kissed boys before, playing games at parties. But she'd never tongue kissed like this. Is this what it's supposed to feel like? she wondered, suddenly feeling a little frightened. She reached up and pushed against Chuck's chest, pulling her head away from him, desperate for air. “I have to go to the bathroom,” she mumbled, stumbling backwards into a stall and locking the door. She could see Chuck's feet, standing outside the stall. “All right,” he said. “But I'm not finished with you yet.” Jenny sat down on the toilet seat without pulling up her dress and pretended to pee. Then she stood up and flushed. “All done?” Chuck called. Jenny didn't answer. Her mind was racing. What should she do? Anxiously, she reached inside her little black handbag for her cell phone. Chuck crouched down to look under the stall door. What was she doing in there, the little tease? He crawled forward on his hands and knees. “All right,” he said. “That's it, I'm coming in.” Jenny closed her eyes and backed against the stall wall. Quickly, she pressed the buttons for Dan's number into her cell phone, praying that he'd answer. Ruby's band was playing their last song, and Serena and Dan were slick with sweat. Dan had some new moves down, and he was in the middle of an experimental slide to the side with a pelvic thrust when his cell phone went off. “Damn,” he said, pulling it out of his pocket. He flipped it open. “Dan,” he heard his sister's voice. “I–” “Hey Jen. Hold on, all right? I can't hear you.” He tapped Serena on the arm and pointed to his phone. “Sorry,” he shouted over the music. He walked back to the table and put his hand over his free ear. “Jenny?” “Dan?” Jenny said. Her voice sounded very small and scared and far away. “I need your help. Please come get me?” “Now?” Dan said. He looked up. Serena was walking toward him, a worried frown on her perfect face. “Is everything okay?” she mouthed. “Please, Dan?” Jenny pleaded. She sounded really upset. “What's wrong?” Dan asked his sister. “Can't you take a cab?” “No, I–” Jenny said, her voice trailing off. “Just please come, okay, Dan?” she finished hurriedly. And then she hung up. “Who was that?” Serena said. “My little sister,” Dan told her. “She's at that party. She wants me to come get her.” “Are you going?” “Yeah, I think I'd better. She sounded kind of weird,” he said. “I'll come with you,” Serena offered. “All right,” Dan said, smiling shyly. This night was getting better and better. “That would be cool.” “We'd better tell Vanessa,” Serena said, heading for the bar. Dan followed her. He'd forgotten all about Vanessa. But she looked like she was having a good time talking to the bartender. “Hey Vanessa,” Serena said, touching Vanessa's arm. “Dan just got a call from his sister at the party. He has to go get her.” Vanessa turned around slowly. She was waiting for Clark's eyes to settle on Serena. For his eyeballs to suddenly register “beautiful girl” in bold black letters like the cherries in a slot machine. But Clark only glanced at Serena like she was just another customer. “What can I get you?” he said, slapping a cocktail napkin down on the bar in front of her. “Oh, nothing, thanks,” Serena said. She turned to Vanessa. “I think I'm going to go with Dan.” “Hey Serena, we better take off,” Dan called urgently from behind them. Vanessa turned around to look at him, waiting so eagerly for Serena. His tongue was practically hanging out of his mouth. “Okay, have a good rest of the night,” Serena said. She leaned over and gave Vanessa a kiss on her cheek. “Tell Ruby I thought she was awesome.” Then she slipped away to join Dan. “See you, Vanessa,” Dan called, turning to go. Vanessa turned back to Clark without a word. She couldn't wait to kiss him again, and forget all about Serena and Dan, heading off into the night together. “Who were they?” Clark said, resting his elbows on the bar. He picked an olive out of a dish and held it just in front of Vanessa's lips. Vanessa bit into the olive and shrugged. “Just some people I don't really know.” s finds hope Dan hailed a cab and opened the door for Serena. The October air was crisp and smelled of burnt sugar, and Dan suddenly felt very elegant and mature–a man in a tuxedo out on the town with a beautiful girl. He slid into the seat beside her and looked down at his hands as the cab pulled away from the curb. They weren't shaking anymore. Unbelievable as it seemed, he had touched Serena with those very hands while they were dancing. And now he was alone with her in a taxi. If he wanted to, he could take her hand, stroke her cheek, maybe even kiss her. He studied her profile, her skin shining in the yellow glow of the streetlights, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. “God I love to dance,” Serena said, letting her head fall back on the seat.
