He was barely thinking at all. Blair's room was a blaze of candles. A bottle of red wine was open on the floor, with two glasses beside it. Blair knelt down and poured each of them a glass like a little geisha. She felt more comfortable naked in the darkness of her room. “What kind of music do you want to listen to?” she asked Nate, handing him a glass. Nate gulped the wine, swallowing noisily. “Music? Anything you want. Whatever,” he said. Of course, Blair had her CD mix all cued up. The first song was Coldplay, because she knew Nate liked them. Slow and sexy, rocker boy. Blair had made and remade the movie of this moment in her head so many times she felt like an actress who was finally getting her big break, playing the role of her career.She reached up and put her hands on Nate's shoulders. He tried not to look at her, but he couldn't help it. She was naked, and she was beautiful. She was a girl and he was a boy. There have been plenty of songs written about this. “Take off your clothes, Nate,” Blair whispered. Maybe after we do it, I'll tell her, Nate thought. That didn't seem completely fair, but still, he kissed her. And once he started, he couldn't stop. When Serena woke up a little while later, Chuck had changed the channel to MTV2 and was singing along loudly to Jay-Z. Serena's Pucci dress had ridden up above her waist, and her lacy blue underwear was showing.Serena propped herself up on her elbows and wiped the lip-gloss scum out of the corners of her mouth. She pulled down her dress. “What time is it?” she said. Chuck glanced at her. “Time for us to take off our clothes and get in bed,” he said impatiently. He'd been waiting long enough. Serena's head felt thick, and she was dying for a glass of water. “I feel awful,” she said, sitting up and rubbing her forehead. “I want to go home.” “Come on,” Chuck said, flicking off the TV. “We could take a hot tub first. That'll make you feel better.” “No,” Serena insisted. “Fine,” Chuck said angrily. He stood up. “There's water on the table. Put your boots on, I'll help you get a cab.” Serena pulled on her boots and stared at the cold rain falling outside the hotel room window. “It's raining,” she said, taking a sip of the water. Chuck handed her a scarf, his trademark blue cashmere, monogrammed with the letters C.B. “Wrap it around your head,” he said. “Come on, let's go.” Serena took the scarf and followed Chuck out to the elevator. They rode down in silence. Serena knew Chuck was disappointed that she was leaving, but she didn't care. She couldn't wait to get out into the fresh air and into her own bed.A cab pulled up, the Remi brothers' poster in the box on the cab's roof. Serena thought it looked like a close-up photograph of lips puckered into a kiss. “What's that? Mars?” Chuck joked, pointing to it. He glanced at Serena without a trace of humor in his eyes. “No, it's your anus!” Serena blinked at him. She couldn't tell if Chuck trying to be funny or if that's what he actually thought the picture was. Chuck held the cab door open for her, and she slid into the back seat. “Thanks, Chuck,” she said sweetly, “I'll see you soon, okay?” “Whatever,” Chuck said. He leaned into the cab and pressed Serena against the seat. “What's your problem anyway?” he hissed. “You've been fucking Nate Archibald since tenth grade, and I'm sure you did just about every guy at boarding school, and in France, too. What, are you like, too good to give me some?” Serena stared directly into Chuck's eyes, seeing him as he really was for the first time. He'd always been hard to like, but she'd never actually hated him before. “That's okay, I wouldn't want to do it with you anyway,” Chuck sneered. “I hear you have diseases.” “Get away from me,” Serena hissed, putting her hands on his chest and shoving him away. She slammed the cab door shut in his face, and gave the driver her address. As the cab pulled away, Serena hugged herself, staring straight ahead through the rain-spattered windshield. When the taxi stopped at a light on the corner of Broadway and Spring, she opened the door, leaned out, and threw up into the gutter. That will teach her not to drink on an empty stomach. Chuck's scarf swung from her neck and dangled in the puddle of pink vomit on the pavement. Serena pulled the scarf off, wiped her mouth on it, and stuffed it into her bag. “Gross,” she said, slamming the cab door closed again. “Tissue, miss?” the cab driver offered, passing a box of Kleenex back to her. Serena pulled one from the box and wiped her mouth with it. “Thanks,” she said. Then she sat back in the seat and closed her eyes, grateful, as always, for the kindness of strangers. “What about a condom or something?” Blair murmured, gaping at Nate's hard-on. It looked like it was going to take over the world. She had managed to get all of his clothes off, and now they were lying down on her bed on top of the covers. They'd been fooling around for almost an hour. On the stereo, the Jennifer Lopez song “Love Don't Cost a Thing” was playing, and Blair was getting hotter and hotter. She reached for Nate's hand and licked his fingers, sucking greedily on the tip of each one. She had a feeling sex was going to be even better than food. Nate rolled onto his back while Blair sucked his fingers. He had been so uptight about seeing Blair that he hadn't eaten dinner, and now he was feeling hungry. Maybe when he went home he'd pick up a burrito from the Mexican place on Lexington Avenue. That's what he wanted, a chicken and black bean burrito with extra guacamole. Blair bit down hard on his pinky. “Ow,” Nate said, his hard-on deflating as if it had been pricked with a pin. He sat up and ran his hands through his hair. “I can't do this,” he muttered under his breath. “What?” Blair said, sitting up too. “What's wrong?” Her heart fell. This wasn't in the script. Nate was ruining a perfect moment. Clumsily, Nate took Blair's hand and looked into her eyes for the first time all night. “I have to tell you something,” he said. “I can't do this without you knowing. I feel like an asshole.” Blair could tell by the look in Nate's eyes that the moment wasn't just ruined, it was killed. “What?” she said softly. Nate reached down and gathered up the edges of the quilt. He draped one end around Blair's shoulders and wrapped the other end around his waist. It didn't seem right to talk about this when they were both so naked. He took Blair's hand again. “Remember the summer before last when you were away in Scotland, at your aunt's wedding?” Nate began. Blair nodded. “It was so friggin' hot that summer. I was in the city with my Dad, just hanging out while he went to some meetings and stuff. I got bored, so I called Serena in Ridgefield, and she came down.” Nate noticed Blair's back stiffen when he mentioned Serena's name. She removed her hand from his and crossed her arms over her chest, her eyes suddenly distrustful. “We had some drinks and sat out in the garden. It was so hot, Serena started splashing around in the fountain, and then she started splashing me. And I guess I got kind of carried away. I mean–” Nate fumbled. He remembered what Cyrus had told him about girls liking surprises. Well, Blair was about to be very surprised, and he didn't think she was going to like it one bit. “And what?” Blair demanded. “What happened?” “We kissed,” Nate said. He took a deep breath and held it. He couldn't just leave it at that. He blew the breath out. “And then we had sex.” Blair threw the quilt off her shoulders and stood up. “I knew it!” she shouted. “Who hasn't had sex with Serena? That nasty, slutty bitch!” “I'm sorry, Blair. But it wasn't like, planned or anything,” Nate said. “It just happened. And it was only that one time, promise. I just didn't want you to think this was my first time, when it wasn't. I had to tell you.” Blair stomped into her bathroom and snatched her pink satin bathrobe off its hook. She put it on, cinching the belt tight. “Get the fuck out of here, Nate,” she said, angry tears sluicing her cheeks. “I can't even look at you. You're pathetic.” “Blair–” Nate pleaded. For a split second he tried to think of something charming to say. He could usually think of something, but nothing came. Blair slammed the bathroom door shut in his face. Nate stood up and pulled on his boxers. Kitty Minky poked her head out from under the bed and stared at him accusingly, her golden cat eyes glowing eerily in the dark. Nate grabbed his jeans, shirt, and shoes and headed for the front door. He could hardly wait for that burrito. The front door closed with a hollow bang, but Blair remained locked in the bathroom, standing in front of the mirror glaring at her tear-stained reflection. The tube of Serena's lip gloss was still lying on the sink where she had left it. Blair picked it up with trembling fingers. Gash, it was called. What an ugly name. Of course Serena could wear lip gloss with ugly names, and tights with holes in them, and dirty old shoes, and never cut her hair, and still get the boy. Blair grunted at the irony of it all and opened her bathroom window, tossing the lip gloss out into the night and waiting to hear it land on the pavement below. But she couldn't hear a thing. Her head was too full of the new movie she was working on. The movie in which the fabulous Serena van der Woodsen was run over by a bus with her stupid picture plastered to the side of it and was horribly maimed. Her old friend Blair would take time out from her busy life with her doting husband, Nate, to feed Elephant Girl Serena mashed pears and tell her all about the parties she and Nate had been to. Serena would grunt and fart in response, but charitable Blair wouldn't mind. It was the least she could do. Everyone would call her Saint Blair, and she would win awards for her golden heart. will s &amp; n hook up again? Just before midnight, the taxi pulled up at 994 Fifth Avenue. Across the street, the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art were deserted, glowing eerily white in the light of the streetlamps. Serena stepped out of the cab and waved to Roland, the old night doorman, who was dozing just inside the lobby. The door to the apartment building opened, but it wasn't Roland who opened it. It was Nate. “Nate!” Serena squealed, genuinely surprised. “Hey, could you loan me five bucks? I haven't got enough cash.
