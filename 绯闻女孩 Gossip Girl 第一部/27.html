But only with you, he meant to add. It takes a girl like Serena to make a guy with two left feet say he loves to dance. They rode the rest of the way in silence, enjoying the tired feeling in their legs and the cool air from the open window on their sweat-dampened foreheads. There was nothing awkward about the fact that they weren't talking. It was nice. When the cab pulled up in front of the old Barneys building on Seventeenth Street, Dan was expecting to see Jenny waiting for them outside, but the sidewalk was empty. “I guess I'm going to have to go in there and get her,” Dan said. He turned to Serena. “You can go ahead home. Or you can wait. .” “I'll come with you,” Serena said. “I may as well see what I missed out on.” Dan paid for the cab, and they got out and headed for the door. “I hope they let us in,” Serena whispered. “I threw my invitation out.” Dan pulled the crumpled invitation Jenny had made for him out of his pocket and flashed it at the bouncer at the door. “She's with me,” he said, putting his arm around Serena. “Go ahead,” the bouncer said, waving them on. She's with me? Dan couldn't believe his balls. He'd had no idea they were that big. “I'd better look around for my sister,” he told Serena when they got inside.“Okay,” she said. “I'll meet you back here in ten minutes.” The room was full of old familiar faces. So familiar that no one there was quite sure whether Serena van der Woodsen had just arrived or if she'd been there all night. She certainly looked like she'd been having a good time. Her hair was windblown, her dress was slipping off her shoulders, there was a run in her tights, and her cheeks were all pink, as if she'd been running. She looked wild, like the kind of girl who'd done everything everyone said she'd done, and probably a whole lot more. Blair noticed Serena right away, standing on the edge of the dance floor in that funny old dress they'd bought together at Alice Underground. Blair pulled away from Nate. “Look who's here,” she said. Nate turned around, gripping Blair's hand when he saw Serena, as if to demonstrate his devotion.Blair squeezed his hand back. “Why don't you go tell her?” she asked him. “Tell her you can't be friends with her anymore.” Her stomach rumbled nervously. After all the throwing up she'd done, she really needed another tuna roll. Nate stared at Serena with grim, slightly stoned determination. If Blair thought it was crucial that he tell Serena to get lost, then he'd do it. He couldn't wait to get this all behind them so he could relax. In fact, after he talked to Serena he was going to head upstairs and find somewhere private to light up. Waspoid rule #1: When things get intense, smoke a joint. “All right,” Nate said, letting go of Blair's hand. “Here I go.” “Hey,” Serena said. She reached up and kissed Nate on the cheek. He blushed. He hadn't expected her to touch him. “You look mah-velous, darling,” she said in a silly, hoity-toity accent. “Thanks,” Nate said. He tried to put his hands in his pockets, but his tuxedo didn't have any. Stupid thing. “So, what have you been up to?” he asked. “Well, I kind of blew off the party,” Serena explained. “I've been out dancing at this crazy place in Brooklyn.” Nate raised his eyebrows in surprise. But then again, nothing Serena said should have surprised him anymore. “So, you want to dance?” Serena asked. She put her arms around Nate's neck before he answered, and began to swing her hips from side to side. Nate glanced at Blair, who was watching them carefully, and collected himself. “Look, Serena,” he said, taking a step back and removing her arms. “I really can't . . . you know . . . be friends . . . not like the way we were before,” he began. Serena gazed into his eyes searchingly, trying to read his true thoughts. “What did I do?” she said. “Did I do something?” “Blair is my girlfriend,” Nate continued. “I have to . . . I have to be loyal to her. I can't . . . I can't really be . . .” He swallowed. Serena crossed her arms over her chest. If only she could hate Nate for being so cruel and so lame. If only he weren't so good-looking. And if only she didn't love him. “Well, I guess we should stop talking then,” she said. “Blair might get mad.” She let her arms fall to her sides and turned abruptly away. As she crossed the room, Serena's eyes met Blair's. She stopped in her tracks and reached into her bag, searching for the twenty-dollar bill Blair had left on the table at the Tribeca Star. She wanted to give it back. As if, somehow, it would prove she hadn't done anything wrong. That night, or ever. Her fingers found her cigarettes instead. She pulled one out and stuck it between her lips. The music was getting louder and around her, people were dancing. Serena could feel Blair watching her, and her hands trembled as she fumbled around in her bag for a light. As usual, she didn't have one. She shook her head in annoyance, and glanced up at Blair. And then, instead of glaring at each other, the two girls smiled. It was strange smile, and neither girl knew what the other meant by it. Was Blair smiling because she had won the boy in the end and stamped all over Serena's party shoes? Because–as usual–she had gotten her way?Was Serena smiling because she felt uncomfortable and nervous? Or was she smiling because she hadn't stooped to Blair's petty level of spreading nasty rumors and playing with Nate's mind?Or was it a sad smile because their friendship was over? Maybe they were smiling because they both knew deep down that no matter what happened next–no matter what boy they fell in or out of love with, or what clothes they wore, or what their SAT scores were, or which college they got into–they both would be all right. After all, the world they lived in took care of its own. Serena pulled the cigarette out of her mouth, dropped it on the floor and began walking toward Blair. When they were face to face, she stopped and fished the twenty-dollar bill out of her bag. “Here,” she said, handing it to Blair. “This is yours.” And then, without another word, she kept on walking, heading for the ladies' room to splash some cold water on her face. Blair looked down at the bill in her hand and stopped smiling. Over by the door, Rebecca Agnelli from the Central Park Save the Peregrine Falcon Foundation was just putting on her mink coat and kissing Kati and Isabel goodnight. Blair walked over and pressed the twenty-dollar bill into her hand. “That's for the birds,” Blair said with her fakest smile. “Don't forget your gift bag!” Serena turned on the tap and splashed her face over and over with cool clean water. It felt so good she wanted to peel off all her clothes and jump in. She leaned against the row of sinks, patting her face dry. Her gaze slipped to the floor, where she saw a pair of black wing-tipped shoes, the fringed end of a blue scarf, and a girl's black handbag. Serena rolled her eyes and walked over. “Chuck, is that you?” she said into the crack in the door. “Who've you got in there with you?” A girl gasped. “Shit,” Serena heard Chuck say. Chuck had stood Jenny up on the toilet-seat lid in the end stall and pulled her dress down so he could get at those massive jugs. Serena had come at the worst possible time. Chuck pushed open the stall door a few inches. “Fuck off,” he growled. Behind him Serena could see little Jenny Humphrey, her dress pulled down around her waist, her arms hugging herself, looking terrified. Someone pushed open the bathroom door. “Jenny? Are you in here?” Dan called. Serena suddenly registered: Jenny was Dan's sister. No wonder she'd sounded weird on the phone. She was about to be mauled by Chuck. “I'm here,” Jenny whimpered. “Get out of here,” Serena snapped at Chuck, pulling the door open just wide enough for him to get past her. Chuck pushed by her, knocking her against the stall door. “Well, excuse me, bitch,” he hissed. “Next time I'll be sure to ask your permission.” “Wait a minute, asshole,” Dan said, sizing Chuck up. “What were you doing to my sister?” Serena pushed the stall door closed and stood outside it, waiting for Jenny to step down from the toilet and fix herself before her brother saw her. Inside, she could hear Jenny sniffling. “Fuck off,” Chuck said, pushing Dan out of the way. “No, you fuck off, Scarf Boy,” Dan said. He'd never been in a fight before. His hands began to shake again. Serena hated it when boys fought. It was so pointless, and it made them look like assholes. “Hey Chuck,” Serena said, poking Chuck in the back. Chuck turned around. “Why don't you go fuck yourself? You know no one else will,” she hissed. “You bitch,” Chuck hissed back. “You think you can come back here and act all high and mighty after everything you've done? You think you can act like such a princess and tell me to fuck off?” “What have I done, Chuck?” Serena demanded. “What is it that you think I've done?” Chuck licked his lips and laughed quietly. “What have you done?” he asked. “You got kicked out of boarding school because you are a perverted slut who made marks on the wall above the bed in your dorm room for every boy you did. You have STDs. You were addicted to all kinds of drugs and busted out of rehab and now you're dealing your own stuff. You were a member of some cult that killed chickens. You have a fucking baby in France.” Chuck took a deep breath and licked his lips. Serena was smiling again. “Wow. I've been busy,” she said. Chuck frowned. He glanced at Dan who was standing there, watching silently with his hands in his pockets. “Fuck off, Chuck,” Serena whispered. Chuck shrugged and grabbed a bottle of Evian off the counter. “Whatever, bitch,” he said, pushing past Dan and out the door. “You know you love me!” Serena yelled after him. Dan knocked on the bathroom stall. “Jenny?” he said gently. “Are you all right?” More sniffling. Jenny couldn't get control of herself. She just could not believe that of all the people in the universe, it had to be Serena van der Woodsen who found her like this. Serena must think she was so pathetic.“I'm okay,” Jenny finally managed to say. She picked her purse up off the floor and pushed open the door. “Just take me home.” Dan put his arm around his sister and Serena took his hand. Together, they wound their way through the crowded party. “Wait! Your gift bags!” Rain Hoffstetter squealed from her post at the front door. She handed Serena and Jenny each a black Kate Spade tote bag. Dan pushed open the doors and ran out into the street to hail a cab. When he found one, Serena got in first, then Jenny, and then Dan. Jenny put her feet up on the hump in the floor and hugged her knees, resting her head against them. Serena reached down and stroked her curly brown hair. “You guys go home first,” Serena offered. Dan glanced at Jenny. She needed to go to bed. “All right,” he agreed, and gave the driver his address. Serena leaned back, still stroking Jenny's hair. “Wow,” she said ironically. “I haven't had this much excitement since I left boarding school.” Dan stared at her, his eyes wide and trusting. “So, those stories . . .” he said, and then he blushed. “I mean, did any of that happen, for real?” Serena frowned. She fished in her bag for a cigarette, and then thought better of it. “Well, what do you think?” she asked. Dan shrugged. “I think it's a bunch of bullshit,” he said. Serena raised her eyebrows playfully. “But how do you know for sure?” she asked. Her mouth was open, the corners of it quavering up and then down. Her blue eyes glowed in the light of a passing car. No, Dan couldn't imagine her doing any of the things Chuck had accused her of. The only thing he could imagine her doing was kissing him. But there was time for that later. “I just don't see you that way,” he said. The corners of Serena's mouth spread wide and she was smiling again. “Good,” she said. She took a deep breath and let her head fall back against the seat. Dan let his head fall back beside hers. “Good,” he agreed, closing his eyes. As they sped past the flashing billboards and bright lights of Times Square, Serena kept her eyes open. She had always thought Times Square was ugly and depressing compared to the quiet, manicured streets of her neighborhood. But now the brilliant lights and loud noises and the steam rising from the grates on the corners gave her hope. In the darkness of the taxi, she reached for Dan's hand at the same moment he reached for hers. She couldn't wait to see what would happen next.
